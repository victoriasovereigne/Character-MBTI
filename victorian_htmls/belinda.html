<p/>Characters

<p/>MRS STANHOPE, a well-bred woman, accomplished in that branch of knowledge which is called the art of rising in the world, had, with but a small fortune, contrived to live in the highest company. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) prided herself upon having established half a dozen nieces most happily, that is to say, upon having married them to men of fortunes far superior to their own. One niece still remained unmarried -- Belinda Portman, of whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) was determined to get rid with all convenient expedition. Belinda was handsome, graceful, sprightly, and highly accomplished; her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) aunt had endeavoured to teach her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) that a young lady's chief business is to please in society, that all her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) charms and accomplishments should be invariably subservient to one grand object -- the establishing herself in the world:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``For this, hands, lips, and eyes were put to school,
And each instructed feature had its rule.''
 (<font color='red'><b>chief</b></font>)</div>Mrs Stanhope did not find Belinda such a docile pupil as her (<font color='blue'><b>Stanhope</b></font>) other nieces, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Stanhope</b></font>) had been educated chiefly in the country; she (<font color='blue'><b>Stanhope</b></font>) had early been inspired with a taste for domestic pleasures; she (<font color='blue'><b>Stanhope</b></font>) was fond of reading, and disposed to conduct herself with prudence and integrity. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Stanhope</b></font>) character, however, was yet to be developed by circumstances.

<p/>Mrs Stanhope lived at Bath, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Stanhope</b></font>) had opportunities of showing her (<font color='blue'><b>Stanhope</b></font>) niece off, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Stanhope</b></font>) thought, to advantage; but as her (<font color='blue'><b>Stanhope</b></font>) health began to decline, she (<font color='blue'><b>Stanhope</b></font>) could not go out with her (<font color='blue'><b>Stanhope</b></font>) as much as she (<font color='blue'><b>Stanhope</b></font>) wished. After manoeuvring with more than her (<font color='blue'><b>Stanhope</b></font>) usual art, she (<font color='blue'><b>Stanhope</b></font>) succeeded in fastening Belinda upon the fashionable Lady Delacour for the season. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) ladyship was so much pleased by Miss Portman's accomplishments and vivacity, as to invite her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) to spend the winter with her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) in London. Soon after her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) arrival in town, Belinda received the following letter from her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) aunt Stanhope.


<p/>``Crescent, Bath.

<p/>``After searching every place I could think of, Anne found your bracelet in your dressing-table, amongst a heap of odd things, which you left behind you to be thrown away: I have sent it to you by a young gentleman, who came to Bath -LRB-unluckily-RRB- the very day you left me -- Mr. Clarence Hervey -- an acquaintance, and great admirer of my Lady Delacour. He (<font color='blue'><b>admirer</b></font>) is really an uncommonly pleasant young man, is highly connected, and has a fine independent fortune. Besides, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is a man of wit and gallantry, quite a connoisseur in female grace and beauty -- just the man to bring a new face into fashion: so, my dear Belinda, I make it a point -- look well when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is introduced to you, and remember, what I have so often told you, that nobody can look well without taking some pains to please.

<p/>``I see -- or at least when I went out more than my health will at present permit -- I used to see multitudes of silly girls, seemingly all cut out upon the same pattern, who frequented public places day after day, and year after year, without any idea farther than that of diverting themselves, or of obtaining transient admiration. How I have pitied and despised the giddy creatures, whilst I have observed them playing off their unmeaning airs, vying with one another in the most obvious, and consequently the most ridiculous manner, so as to expose themselves before the very men they would attract: chattering, tittering, and flirting; full of the present moment, never reflecting upon the future; quite satisfied if they got a partner at a ball, without ever thinking of a partner for life! I have often asked myself, what is to become of such girls when they grow old or ugly, or when the public eye grows tired of them? If they have large fortunes, it is all very well; they can afford to divert themselves for a season or two, without doubt; they are sure to be sought after and followed, not by mere danglers, but by men of suitable views and pretensions: but nothing to my mind can be more miserable than the situation of a poor girl, who, after spending not only the interest, but the solid capital of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) small fortune in dress, and frivolous extravagance, fails in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) matrimonial expectations -LRB-as many do merely from not beginning to speculate in time-RRB-. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) finds herself at five or six-and-thirty a burden to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) friends, destitute of the means of rendering herself independent -LRB-for the girls I speak of never think of learning to play cards-RRB-, de trop in society, yet obliged to hang upon all her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) acquaintance, who wish her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) in heaven, because she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) is unqualified to make the expected return for civilities, having no home, I mean no establishment, no house, &c. fit for the reception of company of a certain rank. -- My dearest Belinda, may this never be your case! -- You have every possible advantage, my love: no pains have been spared in your education, and -LRB-which is the essential point-RRB- I have taken care that this should be known -- so that you have the name of being perfectly accomplished. You will also have the name of being very fashionable, if you go much into public, as doubtless you will with Lady Delacour. -- Your own good sense must make you aware, my dear, that from her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) ladyship's situation and knowledge of the world, it will always be proper, upon all subjects of conversation, for her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) to lead and you to follow: it would be very unfit for a young girl like you to suffer yourself to stand in competition with Lady Delacour, whose high pretensions to wit and beauty are indisputable. I need say no more to you upon this subject, my dear. Even with your limited experience, you must have observed how foolish young people offend those who are the most necessary to their interests, by an imprudent indulgence of their vanity.

<p/>``Lady Delacour has an incomparable taste in dress: consult her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>), my dear, and do not, by an ill-judged economy, counteract my views -- apropos, I have no objection to your being presented at court. You will, of course, have credit with all her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) ladyship's tradespeople, if you manage properly. To know how and when to lay out money is highly commendable, for in some situations, people judge of what one can afford by what one actually spends. -- I know of no law which compels a young lady to tell what her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) age or her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) fortune may be. You have no occasion for caution yet on one of these points.

<p/>``I have covered my old carpet with a handsome green baize, and every stranger who comes to see me, I observe, takes it for granted that I have a rich carpet under it. Say every thing that is proper, in your best manner, for me to Lady Delacour.

<p/>``Adieu, my dear Belinda,
``Yours, very sincerely,
<div class="bookquote">``SELINA STANHOPE.''


 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>It is sometimes fortunate, that the means which are taken to produce certain effects upon the mind have a tendency directly opposite to what is expected. Mrs Stanhope's perpetual anxiety about her (<font color='blue'><b>Stanhope</b></font>) niece's appearance, manners, and establishment, had completely worn out Belinda's patience; she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) had become more insensible to the praises of her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) personal charms and accomplishments than young women of her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) age usually are, because she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) had been so much flattered and shown off as it is called, by her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) match-making aunt. -- Yet Belinda was fond of amusement, and had imbibed some of Mrs Stanhope's prejudices in favour of rank and fashion. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>) taste for literature declined in proportion to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>) intercourse with the fashionable world, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>) did not in this society perceive the least use in the knowledge that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>) had acquired. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>) mind had never been roused to much reflection; she (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>) had in general acted but as a puppet in the hands of others. To her (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>) aunt Stanhope she (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>) had hitherto paid unlimited, habitual, blind obedience; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>) was more undesigning, and more free from affectation and coquetry, than could have been expected, after the course of documenting which she (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>) had gone through. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>) was charmed with the idea of a visit to Lady Delacour, whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) thought the most agreeable -- no, that is too feeble an expression -- the most fascinating person she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) had ever beheld. Such was the light in which her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) ladyship appeared, not only to Belinda, but to all the world -- that is to say, all the world of fashion, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) knew of no other. -- The newspapers were full of Lady Delacour's parties, and Lady Delacour's dresses, and Lady Delacour's bon mots: every thing that her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) ladyship said was repeated as witty; every thing that her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) ladyship wore was imitated as fashionable. Female wit sometimes depends on the beauty of its possessor for its reputation; and the reign of beauty is proverbially short, and fashion often capriciously deserts her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) favourites, even before nature withers their charms. Lady Delacour seemed to be a fortunate exception to these general rules: long after she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) had lost the bloom of youth, she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) continued to be admired as a fashionable bel esprit; and long after she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) had ceased to be a novelty in society, her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) company was courted by all the gay, the witty, and the gallant. To be seen in public with Lady Delacour, to be a visitor at her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) house, were privileges of which numbers were vehemently ambitious; and Belinda Portman was congratulated and envied by all her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) acquaintance, for being admitted as an inmate. How could she (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) avoid thinking herself singularly fortunate?

<p/>A short time after her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) arrival at Lady Delacour's, Belinda began to see through the thin veil with which politeness covers domestic misery. -- Abroad, and at home, Lady Delacour was two different persons. Abroad she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) appeared all life, spirit, and good humour -- at home, listless, fretful, and melancholy; she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) seemed like a spoiled actress off the stage, over-stimulated by applause, and exhausted by the exertions of supporting a fictitious character. -- When her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) house was filled with well-dressed crowds, when it blazed with lights, and resounded with music and dancing, Lady Delacour, in the character of Mistress of the Revels, shone the soul and spirit of pleasure and frolic: but the moment the company retired, when the music ceased, and the lights were extinguishing, the spell was dissolved.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) would sometimes walk up and down the empty magnificent saloon, absorbed in thoughts seemingly of the most painful nature.

<p/>For some days after Belinda's arrival in town she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) heard nothing of Lord Delacour; his (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) lady never mentioned his (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) name, except once accidentally, as she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was showing Miss Portman the house, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Don't open that door -- those are only Lord Delacour's apartments.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>-- The first time Belinda ever saw his (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) lordship, he (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) was dead drunk in the arms of two footmen, who were carrying him (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) up stairs to his (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) bedchamber: his (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) lady, who was just returned from Ranelagh, passed by him (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) on the landing-place with a look of sovereign contempt.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is the matter? -- Who is this?''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Belinda.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Only the body of my Lord Delacour,''  (<font color='red'><b>ladyship</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) ladyship: `his (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) bearers have brought it up the wrong staircase. Take it down again, my good friends: let his (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) lordship go his (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) own way. Don't look so shocked and amazed, Belinda -- don't look so new, child: this funeral of my lord's intellects is to me a nightly, or,'' added her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) ladyship, looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) watch and yawning, <div class="bookquote">``I believe I should say a daily ceremony -- six o'clock, I protest!''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>The next morning, as her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) ladyship and Miss Portman were sitting at the breakfast-table, after a very late breakfast, Lord Delacour entered the room.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Lord Delacour, sober, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>ladyship</b></font>)</div>-- said her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) ladyship to Miss Portman, by way of introducing him (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>). Prejudiced by her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) ladyship, Belinda was inclined to think that Lord Delacour sober would not be more agreeable or more rational than Lord Delacour drunk. <div class="bookquote">``How old do you take my lord to be?''  (<font color='red'><b>ladyship</b></font>)</div>whispered her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) ladyship, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) saw Belinda's eye fixed upon the trembling hand which carried his (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) teacup to his (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) lips: <div class="bookquote">``I'll lay you a wager,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>continued she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) aloud -- <div class="bookquote">``I'll lay your birth-night dress, gold fringe, and laurel wreaths into the bargain, that you don't guess right.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope you don't think of going to this birth-night, lady Delacour?''  (<font color='red'><b>lordship</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) lordship.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll give you six guesses, and I'll bet you don't come within sixteen years,''  (<font color='red'><b>ladyship</b></font>)</div>pursued her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) ladyship, still looking at Belinda.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You cannot have the new carriage you have bespoken,''  (<font color='red'><b>lordship</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) lordship. <div class="bookquote">``Will you do me the honour to attend to me, Lady Delacour?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then you won't venture to guess, Belinda,''  (<font color='red'><b>ladyship</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) ladyship -LRB-without honouring her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) lord with the smallest portion of her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) attention-RRB- -- <div class="bookquote">``Well, I believe you are right -- for certainly you would guess him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) to be six-and-sixty, instead of six-and-thirty; but then he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) can drink more than any two-legged animal in his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) majesty's dominions, and you know that is an advantage which is well worth twenty or thirty years of a man's life -- especially to persons who have no other chance of distinguishing themselves.''

 (<font color='red'><b>lord</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If some people had distinguished themselves a little less in the world,''  (<font color='red'><b>lordship</b></font>)</div>retorted his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) lordship, `it would have been as well!''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``As well! -- how flat!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Flatly then I have to inform you, Lady Delacour, that I will neither be contradicted nor laughed at -- you understand me, -- it would be as well, flat or not flat, my Lady Delacour, if your ladyship would attend more to your own conduct, and less to others!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To that of others -- his (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) lordship means, if he (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) means any thing. Apropos, Belinda, did not you tell me Clarence Hervey is coming to town? -- You have never seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>). -- Well, I'll describe him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) to you by negatives. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) is not a man who ever says any thing flat -- he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) is not a man who must be wound up with half a dozen bottles of champaign before he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) can go -- he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is not a man who, when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) does go, goes wrong, and won't be set right -- he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is not a man, whose whole consequence, if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) were married, would depend on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife -- he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is not a man, who, if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) were married, would be so desperately afraid of being governed by his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife, that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would turn gambler, jockey, or sot, merely to show that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could govern himself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Go on, Lady Delacour,''  (<font color='red'><b>lordship</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) lordship, who had been in vain attempting to balance a spoon on the edge of his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) teacup during the whole of this speech, which was delivered with the most animated desire to provoke -- <div class="bookquote">``Go on, Lady Delacour -- all I desire is, that you should go on; Clarence Hervey will be much obliged to you, and I am sure so shall I. Go on, my Lady Delacour -- go on, and you'll oblige me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>lordship</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I never will oblige you, my lord, that you may depend upon,''  (<font color='red'><b>ladyship</b></font>)</div>cried her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) ladyship, with a look of indignant contempt.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) lordship whistled, rang for his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) horses, and looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) nails with a smile. Belinda, shocked and in a great confusion, rose to leave the room, dreading the gross continuance of this matrimonial dialogue.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr Hervey, my lady,''  (<font color='red'><b>a footman</b></font>)</div>said a footman, opening the door; and he (<font color='blue'><b>footman</b></font>) was scarcely announced, when her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) ladyship went forward to receive him (<font color='blue'><b>footman</b></font>) with an air of easy familiarity. -- <div class="bookquote">``Where have you buried yourself, Hervey, this age past?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>cried she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>), shaking hands with him (<font color='blue'><b>footman</b></font>): `there's absolutely no living in this most stupid of all worlds without you. -- Mr Hervey -- Miss Portman -- but don't look as if you were half asleep, man -- What are you dreaming of, Clarence? Why looks your grace so heavily to-day?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! I have passed a miserable night,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div>replied Clarence, throwing himself into an actor's attitude, and speaking in a fine tone of stage declamation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What was your dream, my lord? I pray you, tell me,''
 (<font color='red'><b>ladyship</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) ladyship in a similar tone. -- Clarence went on --
``O Lord, methought what pain it was to dance!
What dreadful noise of fiddles in my ears!
What sights of ugly belles within my eyes!
-- Then came wandering by,
A shadow like a devil, with red hair,
``Dizen'd with flowers; and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) bawl'd out aloud,
Clarence is come; false, fleeting, perjured Clarence!''
``O, Mrs Luttridge to the life!'' cried Lady Delacour: ``I know where you have been now, and I pity you -- but sit down,'' said she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>), making room for him (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) between Belinda and herself upon the sofa, `sit down here, and tell me what could take you to that odious Mrs Luttridge<div class="bookquote">``s.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr Hervey threw himself on the sofa; Lord Delacour whistled as before, and left the room without uttering a syllable.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But my dream has made me forget myself strangely,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div>said Mr Hervey, turning to Belinda, and producing her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) bracelet: <div class="bookquote">``Mrs Stanhope promised me that if I delivered it safely, I should be rewarded with the honour of putting it on the owner's fair arm.''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>A conversation now took place on the nature of ladies' promises -- on fashionable bracelets -- on the size of the arm of the Venus de Medici -- on Lady Delacour's and Miss Portman's -- on the thick legs of ancient statues -- and on the various defects and absurdities of Mrs Luttridge and her (<font color='blue'><b>Luttridge</b></font>) wig. On all these topics Mr Hervey displayed much wit, gallantry, and satire, with so happy an effect, that Belinda, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) took leave, was precisely of her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) aunt's opinion, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) was a most uncommonly pleasant young man.

<p/>Clarence Hervey might have been more than a pleasant young man, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) had not been smitten with the desire of being thought superior in every thing, and of being the most admired person in all companies. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) had been early flattered with the idea that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) was a man of genius; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) imagined that, as such, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) was entitled to be imprudent, wild, and eccentric. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) affected singularity, in order to establish his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) claims to genius. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) had considerable literary talents, by which he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) was distinguished at Oxford; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) was so dreadfully afraid of passing for a pedant, that when he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) came into the company of the idle and the ignorant, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) pretended to disdain every species of knowledge. His (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) chameleon character seemed to vary in different lights, and according to the different situations in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) happened to be placed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) could be all things to all men -- and to all women. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) was supposed to be a favourite with the fair sex; and of all his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) various excellencies and defects, there was none on which he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) valued himself so much as on his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) gallantry. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) was not profligate; he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) had a strong sense of humour, and quick feelings of humanity; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) was so easily led, or rather so easily excited by his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) companions, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) companions were now of such a sort, that it was probable he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) would soon become vicious. As to his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) connexion with Lady Delacour, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) would have started with horror at the idea of disturbing the peace of a family; but in her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) family, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) said, there was no peace to disturb; he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) was vain of having it seen by the world that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) was distinguished by a lady of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) wit and fashion, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) did not think it incumbent on him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) to be more scrupulous or more attentive to appearances than her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) ladyship. By Lord Delacour's jealousy he (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) was sometimes provoked, sometimes amused, and sometimes flattered. He (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) was constantly of all her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) ladyship's parties in public and private; consequently he (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) saw Belinda almost every day, and every day he (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) with increasing admiration of her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) beauty, and with increasing dread of being taken in to marry a niece of `the catch-match-maker,'' the name by which Mrs Stanhope was known amongst the men of his (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) acquaintance. Young ladies who have the misfortune to be conducted by these artful dames, are always supposed to be partners in all the speculations, though their names may not appear in the firm. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Young</b></font>) had not been prejudiced by the character of her (<font color='blue'><b>Stanhope</b></font>) aunt, Mr Hervey would have thought Belinda an undesigning, unaffected girl; but now he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) suspected her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) of artifice in every word, look, and motion; and even when he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) felt himself most charmed by her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) powers of pleasing, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) was most inclined to despise her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>), for what he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) thought such premature proficiency in scientific coquetry. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) had not sufficient resolution to keep beyond the sphere of her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) attraction; but frequently, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) found himself within it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) cursed his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) folly, and drew back with sudden terror. His (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) manner towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) was so variable and inconsistent, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) knew not how to interpret its language. Sometimes she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) fancied, that with all the eloquence of eyes he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) said, ``I adore you, Belinda;' at other times she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) imagined that his (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) guarded silence meant to warn her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) was so entangled by Lady Delacour, that he (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) could not extricate himself from her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) snares. Whenever this last idea struck her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>), it excited, in the most edifying manner, her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) indignation against coquetry in general, and against her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) ladyship's in particular: she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) became wonderfully clear-sighted to all the improprieties of her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) ladyship's conduct. Belinda's newly acquired moral sense was so much shocked, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) actually wrote a full statement of her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) observations and her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) scruples to her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) aunt Stanhope; concluding by a request, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) might not remain under the protection of a lady, of whose character she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) could not approve, and whose intimacy might perhaps be injurious to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) reputation, if not to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) principles.

<p/>Mrs Stanhope answered Belinda's letter in a very guarded style; she (<font color='blue'><b>Stanhope</b></font>) rebuked her (<font color='blue'><b>Stanhope</b></font>) niece severely for her (<font color='blue'><b>Stanhope</b></font>) imprudence in mentioning names in such a manner, in a letter sent by the common post; assured her (<font color='blue'><b>Stanhope</b></font>) that her (<font color='blue'><b>Stanhope</b></font>) reputation was in no danger; that she (<font color='blue'><b>Stanhope</b></font>) hoped no niece of hers would set up for a prude -- a character more suspected by men of the world than even that of a coquette; that the person alluded to was a perfectly fit chaperon for any young lady to appear with in public, as long as she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was visited by the first people in town; that as to any thing in the private conduct of that person, and as to any private brouillieries between her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) lord, Belinda should observe on these dangerous topics a profound silence, both in her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) letters and her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) conversation; that as long as the lady continued under the protection of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) husband, the world might whisper, but would not speak out; that as to Belinda's own principles, she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) would be utterly inexcusable if, after the education she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) had received, they could be hurt by any bad examples; that she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) could not be too cautious in her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) management of a man of --'s character; that she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) could have no serious cause for jealousy in the quarter she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) apprehended, as marriage there could not be the object; and there was such a difference of age, that no permanent influence could probably be obtained by the lady; that the most certain method for Miss Portman to expose herself to the ridicule of one of the parties, and to the total neglect of the other, would be to betray anxiety or jealousy; that, in short, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) were fool enough to lose her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) own heart, there would be little chance of her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) being wise enough to win that of --, who was evidently a man of gallantry rather than of sentiment, and who was known to play his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cards well, and to have good luck whenever hearts were trumps.

<p/>Belinda's fears of Lady Delacour, as a dangerous rival, were much quieted by the artful insinuations of Mrs Stanhope, with respect to her (<font color='blue'><b>Stanhope</b></font>) age, &c.; and in proportion as her (<font color='blue'><b>Stanhope</b></font>) fears subsided, she (<font color='blue'><b>Stanhope</b></font>) blamed herself for having written too harshly of her (<font color='blue'><b>Stanhope</b></font>) ladyship's conduct. The idea that whilst she (<font color='blue'><b>Stanhope</b></font>) appeared as Lady Delacour's friend she (<font color='blue'><b>Stanhope</b></font>) ought not to propagate any stories to her (<font color='blue'><b>Stanhope</b></font>) disadvantage, operated powerfully upon Belinda's mind, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) reproached herself for having told even her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) aunt what she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) had seen in private. She (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) thought that she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) had been guilty of treachery, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) wrote again immediately to Mrs Stanhope, to conjure her (<font color='blue'><b>Stanhope</b></font>) to burn her (<font color='blue'><b>Stanhope</b></font>) last letter; to forget, if possible, its contents; and to believe that not a syllable of a similar nature should ever more be heard from her (<font color='blue'><b>Stanhope</b></font>): she (<font color='blue'><b>Stanhope</b></font>) was just concluding with the words -- <div class="bookquote">``I hope my dear aunt will consider all this as an error of my judgment, and not of my heart,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>when Lady Delacour burst into the room, exclaiming, in a tone of gaiety, <div class="bookquote">``Tragedy or comedy, Belinda? The masquerade dresses are come. But how's this?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>added she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>), looking full in Belinda's face -- `tears in the eyes! blushes in the cheeks! tremors in the joints! and letters shuffling away! But, you novice of novices, how awkwardly shuffled! -- A niece of Mrs Stanhope's, and so unpractised a shuffler! -- And is it credible she (<font color='blue'><b>Stanhope</b></font>) should tremble in this ridiculous way about a love-letter or two?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No love-letters, indeed, Lady Delacour,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Belinda, holding the paper fast, as her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) ladyship, half in play, half in earnest, attempted to snatch it from her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No love-letters! then it must be treason; and see it I must, by all that's good, or by all that's bad -- I see the name of Delacour!''  (<font color='red'><b>ladyship</b></font>)</div>-- and her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) ladyship absolutely seized the letters by force, in spite of all Belinda's struggles and entreaties.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I beg, I request, I conjure you not to read it!''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>cried Miss Portman, clasping her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) hands. <div class="bookquote">``Read mine, read mine, if you must, but don't read my aunt Stanhope's -- Oh! I beg, I entreat, I conjure you!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and she (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) threw herself upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) knees.

<p/>``You beg! you entreat! you conjure! why, this is like the Duchess of Brinvilliers, who wrote on her (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>) paper of poisons, ``Whoever finds this, I entreat, I conjure them, in the name of more saints than I can remember, not to open the paper any farther.<div class="bookquote">'' -- What a simpleton, to know so little of the nature of curiosity!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>As she (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) spoke, Lady Delacour opened Mrs Stanhope's letter, read it from beginning to end, folded it up coolly when she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) had finished it, and simply said, <div class="bookquote">``The person alluded to is almost as bad as her (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>) name at full length: does Mrs Stanhope think no one can make out an inuendo in a libel, or fill up a blank, but an attorney-general?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>pointing to a blank in Mrs Stanhope's letter, left for the name of Clarence Hervey.

<p/>Belinda was in too much confusion either to speak or think.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You were right to swear they were not love-letters,''  (<font color='red'><b>ladyship</b></font>)</div>pursued her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) ladyship, laying down the papers. <div class="bookquote">``I protest I snatched them by way of frolic -- I beg pardon. All I can do now is not to read the rest.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay -- I beg -- I wish -- I insist upon your reading mine,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Belinda.

<p/>When Lady Delacour had read it, her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) countenance suddenly changed -- <div class="bookquote">``Worth a hundred of your aunt's, I declare,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>), patting Belinda's cheek. <div class="bookquote">``What a treasure to meet with any thing like a new heart! -- all hearts, now-a-days, are second-hand, at best.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div><p/>Lady Delacour spoke with a tone of feeling which Belinda had never heard from her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) before, and which at this moment touched her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) so much, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) took her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) ladyship's hand and kissed it.

<p/>CHAPTER II

<p/>Masks

<p/><div class="bookquote">``WHERE were we when all this began?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>cried Lady Delacour, forcing herself to resume an air of gaiety -- <div class="bookquote">``O, masquerade was the order of the day -- tragedy or comedy? which suits your genius best, my dear?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Whichever suits your ladyship's taste least.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, my woman, Marriott, says I ought to be tragedy; and, upon the notion that people always succeed best when they take characters diametrically opposite to their own -- Clarence Hervey's principle -- perhaps you don't think that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) has any principles; but there you are wrong; I do assure you, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) has sound principles -- of taste.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Belinda, with a constrained smile, `he (<font color='blue'><b>herself</b></font>) gives the most convincing proof; by his (<font color='blue'><b>herself</b></font>) admiring your ladyship so much.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And by his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) admiring Miss Portman so much more. But whilst we are making speeches to one another, poor Marriott is standing in distress, like Garrick, between tragedy and comedy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div><p/>Lady Delacour opened her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) dressing-room door, and pointed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) stood with the dress of the comic muse on one arm, and the tragic muse on the other.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am afraid I have not spirits enough to undertake the comic muse,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Miss Portman.

<p/>Marriott, who was a personage of prodigious consequence, and the judge in the last resort at her (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) mistress's toilette, looked extremely out of humour at having been kept waiting so long; and yet more so at the idea that her (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) appellant jurisdiction could be disputed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your ladyship's taller than Miss Portman by half a head,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marriott/Mrs Marriott</b></font>)</div>said Marriott, `and to be sure will best become tragedy with this long train; besides, I had settled all the rest of your ladyship's dress. Tragedy, they say, is always tall; and, no offence, your ladyship's taller than Miss Portman by half a head.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``For head read inch,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>said Lady Delacour, `if you please.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``When things are settled, one can't bear to have them unsettled -- but your ladyship must have your own way, to be sure -- I'll say no more,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>cried she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>), throwing down the dresses.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Stay, Marriott,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>said Lady Delacour, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) placed herself between the angry waiting-maid and the door.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why will you, who are the best creature in the world, put yourself into these furies about nothing? Have patience with us, and you shall be satisfied.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's another affair,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marriott/Mrs Marriott</b></font>)</div>said Marriott.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Portman,''  (<font color='red'><b>ladyship</b></font>)</div>continued her (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) ladyship, `don't talk of not having spirits, you that are all life! -- What say you, Belinda? -- O yes, you must be the comic muse; and I, it seems, must be tragedy, because Marriott has a passion for seeing me <div class="bookquote">``come sweeping by.''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>And because Marriott must have her (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) own way in every thing -- she (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) rules me with a rod of iron, my dear, so tragedy I needs must be. -- Marriott knows her (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) power.''

<p/>There was an air of extreme vexation in Lady Delacour's countenance as she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) pronounced these last words, in which evidently more was meant than met the ear. Upon many occasions Miss Portman had observed, that Marriott exercised despotic authority over her (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) mistress; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) had seen, with surprise, that a lady, who would not yield an iota of power to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) husband, submitted herself to every caprice of the most insolent of waiting-women. For some time, Belinda imagined that this submission was merely an air, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) had seen some other fine ladies proud of appearing to be governed by a favourite maid; but she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) was soon convinced that Marriott was no favourite with Lady Delacour; that her (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) ladyship's was not proud humility, but fear. It seemed certain that a woman, extravagantly fond of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) own will, would never have given it up without some very substantial reason. It seemed as if Marriott was in possession of some secret, which should for ever remain unknown. This idea had occurred to Miss Portman more than once, but never so forcibly as upon the present occasion. There had always been some mystery about her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) ladyship's toilette: at certain hours doors were bolted, and it was impossible for any body but Marriott to obtain admission. Miss Portman at first imagined that Lady Delacour dreaded the discovery of her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) cosmetic secrets, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) ladyship's rouge was so glaring, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) pearl powder was so obvious, that Belinda was convinced there must be some other cause for this toilette secrecy. There was a little cabinet beyond her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) bedchamber, which Lady Delacour called her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) boudoir, to which there was an entrance by a back staircase; but no one ever entered there but Marriott. One night, Lady Delacour, after dancing with great spirit at a ball, at her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) own house, fainted suddenly: Miss Portman attended her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) to her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) bedchamber, but Marriott begged that her (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) lady might be left alone with her (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) would by no means suffer Belinda to follow her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) into the boudoir. All these things Belinda recollected, in the space of a few seconds, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) stood contemplating Marriott and the dresses. The hurry of getting ready for the masquerade, however, dispelled these thoughts, and by the time she (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) was dressed, the idea of what Clarence Hervey would think of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) appearance was uppermost in her (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) mind. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) was anxious to know whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) would discover her (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) in the character of the comic muse. Lady Delacour was discontented with her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) tragic attire, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) grew still more out of humour with herself; when she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) saw Belinda.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I protest Marriott has made a perfect fright of me,''  (<font color='red'><b>ladyship</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) ladyship, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) got into her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) carriage, `and I'm positive my dress would become you a million of times better than your own.''

<p/>Miss Portman regretted that it was too late to change.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not at all too late, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>said Lady Delacour; `never too late for women to change their minds, their dress, or their lovers. Seriously, you know, we are to call at my friend Lady Singleton's -- she (<font color='blue'><b>Singleton</b></font>) sees masks to-night: I'm quite intimate there; I'll make her (<font color='blue'><b>Singleton</b></font>) let me step up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Singleton</b></font>) own room, where no soul can interrupt us, and there we can change our dresses, and Marriott will know nothing of the matter. Marriott's a faithful creature, and very fond of me; fond of power too -- but who is not? -- we must all have our faults: one would not quarrel with such a good creature as Marriott for a trifle.'' Then suddenly changing her (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) tone, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Not a human being will find us out at the masquerade; for no one but Mrs Freke knows that we are the two muses. Clarence Hervey swears he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) should know me in any disguise -- but I defy him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) -- I shall take special delight in puzzling him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>). Harriot Freke has told him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>), in confidence, that I'm to be the widow Brady, in man's clothes: now that's to be Harriot's own character; so Hervey will make fine confusion.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Singleton</b></font>)</div><p/>As soon as they got to Lady Singleton's, Lady Delacour and Miss Portman immediately went up stairs to exchange dresses. Poor Belinda, now that she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) felt herself in spirits to undertake the comic muse, was rather vexed to be obliged to give up her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) becoming character; but there was no resisting the polite energy of Lady Delacour's vanity. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) ladyship ran as quick as lightning into a closet within the dressing-room, saying to Lady Singleton's woman, who attempted to follow with -- <div class="bookquote">``Can I do any thing for your ladyship?''  (<font color='red'><b>Singleton woman</b></font>)</div>-- ``No, no, no -- nothing, nothing -- thank ye, thank ye -- I want no assistance -- I never let any body do any thing for me but Marriott;' and she (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) bolted herself in the closet. In a few minutes she (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) half opened the door, threw out her (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) tragic robes, and cried, <div class="bookquote">``Here, Miss Portman, give me yours -- quick -- and let's see whether comedy or tragedy will be ready first.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Lord bless and forgive me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Singleton</b></font>)</div>said Lady Singleton's woman, when Lady Delacour at last threw open the door, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) was completely dressed -- `but if your la`ship has not been dressing all this time in that den, without any thing in the shape of a looking-glass, and not to let me help! I that should have been so proud.''

<p/>Lady Delacour put half a guinea into the waiting-maid's hand, laughed affectedly at her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) own whimsicalities, and declared that she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) could always dress herself better without a glass than with one. All this went off admirably well with every body but Miss Portman; she (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) could not help thinking it extraordinary that a person who was obviously fond of being waited upon would never suffer any person to assist her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) at her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) toilet except Marriott, a woman of whom she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was evidently afraid. Lady Delacour's quick eye saw curiosity painted in Belinda's countenance, and for a moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) was embarrassed; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) soon recovered herself, and endeavoured to turn the course of Miss Portman's thoughts by whispering to her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) some nonsense about Clarence Hervey -- a cabalistical name, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) knew had the power, when pronounced in a certain tone, of throwing Belinda into confusion.

<p/>The first person they saw, when they went into the drawing-room at Lady Singleton's, was this very Clarence Hervey, who was not in a masquerade dress. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) had laid a wager with one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) acquaintance, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) could perform the part of the serpent, such as he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) is seen in Fuseli's well-known picture. For this purpose he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) had exerted much ingenuity in the invention and execution of a length of coiled skin, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) manoeuvred with great dexterity, by means of internal wires; his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) grand difficulty had been to manufacture the rays that were to come from his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) eyes. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) had contrived a set of phosphoric rays, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) was certain would charm all the fair daughters of Eve. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) forgot, it seems, that phosphorus could not well be seen by candlelight. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) was just equipped as a serpent, his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) rays set fire to part of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) envelope, and it was with the greatest difficulty that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) was extricated. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) escaped unhurt, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) serpent's skin was utterly consumed; nothing remained but the melancholy spectacle of its skeleton. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) was obliged to give up the hopes of shining at the masquerade, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) resolved to be at Lady Singleton's that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) might meet Lady Delacour and Miss Portman. The moment that the tragic and comic muse appeared, he (<font color='blue'><b>muse</b></font>) invoked them with much humour and mock pathos, declaring that he (<font color='blue'><b>muse</b></font>) knew not which of them could best sing his (<font color='blue'><b>muse</b></font>) adventure. After a recital of his (<font color='blue'><b>muse</b></font>) misfortune had entertained the company, and after the muses had performed their parts to the satisfaction of the audience and their own, the conversation ceased to be supported in masquerade character; muses and harlequins, gipsies and Cleopatras, began to talk of their private affairs, and of the news and the scandal of the day.

<p/>A group of gentlemen, amongst whom was Clarence Hervey, gathered round the tragic muse; as Mr Hervey had hinted that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) knew she (<font color='blue'><b>muses</b></font>) was a person of distinction, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) would not tell her (<font color='blue'><b>muses</b></font>) name. After he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) had exercised his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) wit for some time, without obtaining from the tragic muse one single syllable, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) whispered, <div class="bookquote">``Lady Delacour, why this unnatural reserve? Do you imagine that, through this tragical disguise, I have not found you out?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The tragic muse, apparently absorbed in meditation, vouched no reply.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The devil a word can you get for your pains, Hervey,''  (<font color='red'><b>a gentleman</b></font>)</div>said a gentleman of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) acquaintance, who joined the party at this instant. <div class="bookquote">``Why didn't you stick to t`other muse, who, to do her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) justice, is as arrant a flirt as your heart could wish for?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There's danger in flirting,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div>said Clarence, `with an arrant flirt of Mrs Stanhope's training. There's a kind of electricity about that girl. I have a sort of cobweb feeling, an imaginary net coming all over me.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Fore-warned is fore-armed,''  (<font color='red'><b>companion</b></font>)</div>replied his (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) companion: 'a man must be a novice indeed that could be taken in at this time of day by a niece of Mrs Stanhope<div class="bookquote">``s.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Stanhope/Stanhope</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That Mrs Stanhope must be a good clever dame, faith,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Stanhope/Stanhope</b></font>)</div>said a third gentleman: `there's no less than six of her (<font color='blue'><b>Stanhope</b></font>) nieces whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Stanhope</b></font>) has got off within these four winters -- not one of 'em now that has not made a catch-match. -- There's the eldest of the set, Mrs Tollemache, what had she (<font color='blue'><b>Tollemache</b></font>), in the devil's name, to set up with in the world but a pair of good eyes? -- her (<font color='blue'><b>Tollemache</b></font>) aunt, to be sure, taught her (<font color='blue'><b>Tollemache</b></font>) the use of them early enough: they might have rolled to all eternity before they would have rolled me out of my senses; but you see they did Tollemache's business. However, they are going to part now, I hear: Tollemache was tired of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tollemache</b></font>) before the honey-moon was over, as I foretold. Then there's the musical girl. Joddrell, who has no more ear than a post, went and married her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), because he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) had a mind to set up for a connoisseur in music; and Mrs Stanhope flattered him (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) was one.''

<p/>The gentlemen joined in the general laugh; the tragic muse sighed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Even were she (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>) at the School of Scandal, the tragic muse dare not laugh, except behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>) mask,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div>said Clarence Hervey.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Far be it from her (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>) to laugh at those follies which she (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>) must for ever deplore!''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Belinda, in a feigned voice. -- <div class="bookquote">``What miseries spring from these ill-suited marriages! The victims are sacrificed before they have sense enough to avoid their fate.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div><p/>Clarence Hervey imagined that this speech alluded to Lady Delacour's own marriage.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Damn me if I know any woman, young or old, that would avoid being married, if she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) could, though,''  (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Philip Baddely</b></font>)</div>cried Sir Philip Baddely, a gentleman who always supplied `each vacuity of sense' with an oath: `but, Rochfort, didn't Valleton marry one of these nieces?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes: she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was a mighty fine dancer, and had good legs enough: Mrs Stanhope got poor Valleton to fight a duel about her (<font color='blue'><b>Stanhope</b></font>) place in a country dance, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) was so pleased with himself for his (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) prowess, that he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) married the girl.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div><p/>Belinda made an effort to change her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) seat, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) was encompassed so that she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) could not retreat.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``As to Jenny Mason, the fifth of the nieces,''  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>continued the witty gentleman, `she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) was as brown as mahogany, and had neither eyes, nose, mouth, nor legs: what Mrs Stanhope could do with her (<font color='blue'><b>Stanhope</b></font>) I often wondered; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Stanhope</b></font>) took courage, rouged her (<font color='blue'><b>Stanhope</b></font>) up, set her (<font color='blue'><b>Stanhope</b></font>) a going as a dasher, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Stanhope</b></font>) dashed herself into Tom Levit's curricle, and Tom couldn't get her (<font color='blue'><b>Stanhope</b></font>) out again till she (<font color='blue'><b>Stanhope</b></font>) was the honourable Mrs Levit: she (<font color='blue'><b>Levit</b></font>) then took the reins into her (<font color='blue'><b>Levit</b></font>) own hands, and I hear she (<font color='blue'><b>Levit</b></font>)'s driving him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) and herself the road to ruin as fast as they can gallop. As for this Belinda Portman, 'twas a good hit to send her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) to Lady Delacour's; but, I take it she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) hangs upon hand; for last winter, when I was at Bath, she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) was hawked about every where, and the aunt was puffing her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) with might and main. You heard of nothing, wherever you went, but of Belinda Portman, and Belinda Portman's accomplishments: Belinda Portman, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) accomplishments, I'll swear, were as well advertised as Packwood's razor strops.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mrs Stanhope overdid the business, I think,''  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>resumed the gentleman who began the conversation: `girls brought to the hammer this way don't go off well. It's true, Christie himself is no match for dame Stanhope. Many of my acquaintance were tempted to go and look at the premises, but not one, you may be sure, had a thought of becoming a tenant for life.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's an honour reserved for you, Clarence Hervey,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>said another, tapping him (<font color='blue'><b>Christie</b></font>) upon the shoulder. -- <div class="bookquote">``Give ye joy, Hervey; give ye joy!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Me!''  (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div>said Clarence, starting.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll be hanged if he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) didn't change colour,''  (<font color='red'><b>companion men</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) facetious companion; and all the young men again joined in a laugh.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Laugh on, my merry men all!''  (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div>cried Clarence; `but the devil's in it if I don't know my own mind better than any of you. You don't imagine I go to Lady Delacour's to look for a wife ? -- Belinda Portman's a good pretty girl, but what then? Do you think I'm an idiot? -- do you think I could be taken in by one of the Stanhope school? Do you think I don't see as plainly as any of you that Belinda Portman's a composition of art and affectation?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hush -- not so loud, Clarence; here she (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>) comes,''  (<font color='red'><b>companion</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>idiot</b></font>) companion. <div class="bookquote">``The comic muse, is not she (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>) -- ?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div><p/>Lady Delacour, at this moment, came lightly tripping towards them, and addressing herself, in the character of the comic muse, to Hervey, exclaimed,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hervey! my Hervey! most favoured of my votaries, why do you forsake me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why mourns my friend, why weeps his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) downcast eye?
That eye where mirth and fancy used to shine.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the daughters</b></font>)</div>Though you have lost your serpent's form, yet you may please any of the fair daughters of Eve in your own.''
Mr Hervey bowed; all the gentlemen who stood near him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) smiled; the tragic muse gave an involuntary sigh.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Could I borrow a sigh, or a tear, from my tragic sister,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>pursued Lady Delacour, `however unbecoming to my character, I would, if only sighs or tears can win the heart of Clarence Hervey: -- let me practice' -- and her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) ladyship practiced sighing with much comic effect.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Persuasive words and more persuasive sighs,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div>said Clarence Hervey.
<div class="bookquote">``A good bold Stanhope cast of the net, faith,''  (<font color='red'><b>companions</b></font>)</div>whispered one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) companions. <div class="bookquote">``Melpomene, hast thou forgot thyself to marble?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>pursued Lady Delacour. <div class="bookquote">``I am not very well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>whispered Miss Portman to her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) ladyship: `could we get away?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Get away from Clarence Hervey, do you mean?''  (<font color='red'><b>ladyship</b></font>)</div>replied her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) ladyship, in a whisper: <div class="bookquote">''tis not easy, but we'll try what can be done, if it is necessary.''

 (<font color='red'><b>ladyship</b></font>)</div><p/>Belinda had no power to reply to this raillery; indeed, she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) scarcely heard the words that were said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>); but she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) put her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) arm within Lady Delacour's, who, to her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) great relief, had the good nature to leave the room with her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) immediately. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) ladyship, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) would sacrifice the feelings of others, without compunction, to her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) vanity, whenever the power of her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) wit was disputed, yet towards those by whom it was acknowledged she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) showed some mercy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is the matter with the child?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>), as she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) went down the staircase.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing, if I could have air,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Belinda. There was a crowd of servants in the hall.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why does Lady Delacour avoid me so pertinaciously? What crime have I committed, that I was not favoured with one word?''  (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div>said Clarence Hervey, who had followed them down stairs, and overtook them in the hall.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do see if you can find any of my people,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>cried Lady Delacour.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Lady Delacour, the comic muse!''  (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Mr Hervey. ``I thought -- '

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No matter what you thought,''  (<font color='red'><b>ladyship</b></font>)</div>interrupted her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) ladyship. <div class="bookquote">``Let my carriage draw up, for here's a young friend of yours trembling so about nothing, that I am half afraid she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) will faint; and you know it would not be so pleasant here amongst footmen. Stay! This room is empty. O, I did not mean to tell you to stay,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) to Hervey, who involuntarily followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) in the utmost consternation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm perfectly well, now -- perfectly well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Belinda.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Perfectly a simpleton, I think,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>said Lady Delacour. <div class="bookquote">``Nay, my dear, you must be ruled; your mask must come off: didn't you tell me you wanted air? -- What now! This is not the first time Clarence Hervey has ever seen your face without a mask, is it? It's the first time indeed he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>), or anybody else, ever saw it of such a colour, I believe.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div><p/>When Lady Delacour pulled off Belinda's mask, her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) face was, during the first instant, pale; the next moment, crimsoned over with a burning blush.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is the matter with ye both? How he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) stands!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>said Lady Delacour, turning to Mr Hervey. <div class="bookquote">``Did you never see a woman blush before? -- or did you never say or do any thing to make a woman blush before? Will you give Miss Portman a glass of water? -- there's some behind you on that sideboard, man! -- but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has neither eyes, ears, nor understanding. -- Do go about your business,''  (<font color='red'><b>ladyship</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) ladyship, pushing him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) towards the door -- <div class="bookquote">``Do go about your business, for I haven't common patience with you: on my conscience I believe the man's in love -- and not with me! That's sal-volatile for you, child, I perceive,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>continued she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) to Belinda. <div class="bookquote">``O, you can walk now -- but remember you are on slippery ground: remember Clarence Hervey is not a marrying man, and you are not a married woman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is perfectly indifferent to me, madam,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>Belinda said, with a voice and look of proud indignation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Lady Delacour, your carriage has drawn up,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div>said Clarence Hervey, returning to the door, but without entering.

<p/>``Then put this ``perfectly well'' and ``perfectly indifferent<div class="bookquote">'' lady into it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>said Lady Delacour.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) obeyed without uttering a syllable.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dumb! absolutely dumb! I protest,''  (<font color='red'><b>ladyship</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) ladyship, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) handed her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) in afterwards. <div class="bookquote">``Why, Clarence, the casting of your serpent's skin seems to have quite changed your nature -- nothing but the simplicity of the dove left; and I expect to hear you cooing presently -- don't you, Miss Portman?''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) ordered the coachman to drive to the Pantheon.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``To the Pantheon! I was in hopes your ladyship would have the goodness to set me down at home; for indeed I shall be a burden to you and everybody else at the masquerade.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``If you have made any appointment for the rest of the evening in Berkley-square, I'll set you down, certainly, if you insist upon it, my dear -- for punctuality is a virtue; but prudence is a virtue too, in a young lady; who, as your aunt Stanhope would say, has to establish herself in the world. Why these tears, Belinda? -- or are they tears? for by the light of the lamps I can scarcely tell; though I'll swear I saw the handkerchief at the eyes. What is the meaning of all this? You'd best trust me -- for I know as much of men and manners as your aunt Stanhope at least; and in one word, you have nothing to fear from me, and every thing to hope from yourself, if you will only dry up your tears, keep on your mask, and take my advise; you'll find it as good as your aunt Stanhope<div class="bookquote">``s.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My aunt Stanhope's! O,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>cried Belinda, `never, never more will I take such advice; never more will I expose myself to be insulted as a female adventurer. -- Little did I know in what a light I appeared; little did I know what gentlemen thought of my aunt Stanhope, of my cousins, of myself!''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Gentlemen! I presume Clarence Hervey stands at this instant, in your imagination, as the representative of all the gentlemen in England; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>), instead of Anacharsis Cloots, is now, to be sure, l'orateur du genre humain. Pray let me have a speciman of the eloquence, which, to judge by its effects, must be powerful indeed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Portman, not without some reluctance, repeated the conversation which she (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) had heard. -- <div class="bookquote">``And is this all!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>cried Lady Delacour. ``Lord, my dear, you must either give up living in the world, or expect to hear yourself, and your aunts, and your cousins, and your friends, from generation to generation, abused every hour in the day by their friends and your friends; `tis the common course of things. Now you know what a multitude of obedient humble servants, dear creatures, and very sincere and most affectionate friends, I have in my writing-desk, and on my mantel-piece, not to mention the cards which crowd the common rack from intimate acquaintance, who cannot live without the honour, or favour, or pleasure of seeing Lady Delacour twice a week; -- do you think I'm fool enough to imagine that they would care the hundredth part of a straw if I were this minute thrown into the Red or the Black Sea? -- No, I have not one real friend in the world except Harriot Freke; yet, you see I am the comic muse, and mean to keep it up -- keep it up to the last -- on purpose to provoke those who would give their eyes to be able to pity me; -- I humbly thank them, no pity for Lady Delacour. Follow my example, Belinda; elbow your way through the crowd: if you stop to be civil and beg pardon, and <div class="bookquote">``hope I didn't hurt ye,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>you will be trod under foot. Now you'll meet those young men continually who took the liberty of laughing at your aunt, and your cousins, and yourself; they are men of fashion. Show them you've no feeling, and they'll acknowledge you for a woman of fashion. You'll marry better than any of your cousins -- Clarence Hervey if you can; and then it will be your turn to laugh about nets and cages. As to love and all that -- '

<p/>The carriage stopped at the Pantheon just as her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) ladyship came to the words `love and all that.'' Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) thoughts took a different turn, and during the remainder of the night she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) exhibited, in such a manner as to attract universal admiration, all the ease, and grace, and gaiety, of Euphrosyne.

<p/>To Belinda the night appeared long and dull: the commonplace wit of chimney-sweepers and gipsies, the antics of harlequins, the graces of flower-girls and Cleopatras, had not power to amuse her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>); for her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) thoughts still recurred to that conversation which had given her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) so much pain -- a pain which Lady Delacour's raillery had failed to obliterate.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How happy you are, Lady Delacour,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>), when they got into the carriage to go home; `how happy you are to have such an amazing flow of spirits!''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Amazing you might well say, if you knew all,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>said Lady Delacour; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) heaved a deep sigh, threw herself back in the carriage, let fall her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) mask, and was silent. It was broad daylight, and Belinda had a full view of her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) countenance, which was the picture of despair. She (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) uttered not one syllable more, nor had Miss Portman the courage to interrupt her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) meditations till they came within sight of Lady Singleton's, when Belinda ventured to remind her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) had resolved to stop there and change dresses before Marriott saw them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, it's no matter,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>said Lady Delacour; <div class="bookquote">``Marriott will leave me at the last, like all the rest -- `tis no matter.''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) ladyship sunk back into her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) former attitude; but after she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) had remained silent for some minutes, she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) started up and exclaimed --

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If I had served myself with half the zeal that I have served the world, I should not now be thus forsaken! I have sacrificed reputation, happiness, every thing to the love of frolic: -- all frolic will soon be at an end with me -- I am dying -- and I shall die unlamented by any human being. If I were to live my life over again, what a different life it should be! -- What a different person I would be 1 ! -- But it is all over now -- I am dying.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Belinda's astonishment at these words, and at the solemn manner in which they were pronounced, was inexpressible; she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) gazed at Lady Delacour, and then repeated the word, -- <div class="bookquote">``dying!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>-- <div class="bookquote">``Yes, dying!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>said Lady Delacour.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But you seem to me, and to all the world, in perfect health; and but half an hour ago in perfect spirits,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Belinda.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I seem to you and to all the world, what I am not -- I tell you, I am dying.''  (<font color='red'><b>ladyship</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) ladyship in an emphatic tone.

<p/>Not a word more passed till they got home. Lady Delacour hurried up stairs, bidding Belinda follow her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) to her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) dressing-room. Marriott was lighting the six wax candles on the dressing-table. -- <div class="bookquote">``As I live, they have changed dresses after all,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marriott/Mrs Marriott</b></font>)</div>said Marriott to herself, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) fixed her (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) eyes upon Lady Delacour and Miss Portman. <div class="bookquote">``I'll be burnt if I don't make my lady remember this.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Marriott, you need not wait; I'll ring when I want you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>said Lady Delacour; and taking one of the candles from the table, she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) passed on hastily with Miss Portman through her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) dressing-room, through her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) bedchamber, and to the door of the mysterious cabinet.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Marriot, the key of this door,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>cried she (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) impatiently, after she (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) had in vain attempted to open it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Heavenly graciousness!''  (<font color='red'><b>Marriott/Mrs Marriott</b></font>)</div>cried Marriott; `is my lady out of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) senses?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The key -- the key -- quick, the key,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>repeated Lady Delacour, in a peremptory tone. She (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) seized it as soon as Marriott drew it from her (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) pocket, and unlocked the door.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Had not I best put the things to rights, my lady!''  (<font color='red'><b>Marriott/Mrs Marriott</b></font>)</div>said Marriott, catching fast hold of the opening door.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll ring when you are wanted, Marriott,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>said Lady Delacour; and pushing open the door with violence she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) rushed forward to the middle of the room, and turning back, she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) beckoned to Belinda to follow her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) -- <div class="bookquote">``Come in; what is it you are afraid of?''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>). Belinda went on, and the moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) was in the room, Lady Delacour shut and locked the door. The room was rather dark, as there was no light in it except what came from the candle which Lady Delacour held in her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) hand, and which burned but dimly. Belinda, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) looked round, saw nothing but a confusion of linen rags; vials, some empty, some full, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) perceived that there was a strong smell of medicines.

<p/>Lady Delacour, whose motions were all precipitate, like those of a person whose mind is in great agitation, looked from side to side of the room, without seeming to know what she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) was in search of. She (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) then, with a species of fury, wiped the paint from her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) face, and returning to Belinda, held the candle so as to throw the light full upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) livid features. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) eyes were sunk, her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) cheeks hollow; no trace of youth or beauty remained on her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) death-like countenance, which formed a horrid contrast with her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) gay fantastic dress.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are shocked, Belinda,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>); `but as yet you have seen nothing -- look here,'' -- and baring one half of her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) bosom, she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) revealed a hideous spectacle.

<p/>Belinda sunk back into a chair; Lady Delacour flung herself on her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) knees before her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Am I humbled, am I wretched enough?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>cried she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>), her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) voice trembling with agony. <div class="bookquote">``Yes, pity me for what you have seen, and a thousand times more for that which you cannot see: -- my mind is eaten away like my body by incurable disease -- inveterate remorse -- remorse for a life of folly -- of folly which has brought on me all the punishments of guilt.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My husband,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>continued she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>), and her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) voice suddenly altered from the tone of grief to that of anger -- `my husband hates me -- no matter -- I despise him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>). His (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) relations hate me -- no matter -- I despise them. My own relations hate me -- no matter, I never wish to see them more -- never shall they see my sorrow -- never shall they hear a complaint, a sigh from me. There is no torture which I could not more easily endure than their insulting pity. I will die, as I have lived, the envy and admiration of the world. When I am gone, let them find out their mistake; and moralize, if they will, over my grave.'' She (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) paused. Belinda had no power to speak.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Promise, swear to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>resumed Lady Delacour vehemently, seizing Belinda's hand, ' that you will never reveal to any mortal what you have seen and heard this night. No living creature suspects that Lady Delacour is dying by inches, except Marriott and that woman whom but a few hours ago I thought my real friend, to whom I trusted every secret of my life, every thought of my heart. Fool! idiot! dupe that I was to trust to the friendship of a woman whom I knew to be without principle: but I thought she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had honour; I thought she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) could never betray me. -- O Harriot! Harriot! you to desert me! -- Any thing else I could have borne -- but you, who I thought would have supported me in the tortures of mind and body which I am to go through -- you that I thought would receive my last breath -- you to desert me! -- Now I am alone in the world -- left to the mercy of an insolent waiting-woman.''

<p/>Lady Delacour hid her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) face in Belinda's lap, and almost stifled by the violence of contending emotions, she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) at last gave vent to them, and sobbed aloud.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Trust to one,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Belinda, pressing her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) hand, with all the tenderness which humanity could dictate, `who will never leave you at the mercy of an insolent waiting-woman -- trust to me.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Trust to you!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>said Lady Delacour, looking up eagerly in Belinda's face; `yes, -- I think -- I may trust to you; for though a niece of Mrs Stanhope's, I have seen this day, and have seen with surprise, symptoms of artless feeling about you. This was what tempted me to open my mind to you when I found that I had lost the only friend -- but I will think no more of that -- if you have a heart, you must feel for me. -- Leave me now -- tomorrow you shall hear my whole history -- now I am quite exhausted -- ring for Marriott.'' Marriott appeared with a face of constrained civility and latent rage. ``Put me to bed, Marriott,<div class="bookquote">'' said Lady Delacour, with a subdued voice; `but first light Miss Portman to her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) room -- she (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) need not -- yet -- see the horrid business of my toilette.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Marriott/Mrs Marriott</b></font>)</div><p/>Belinda, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) was left alone, immediately opened her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) shutters, and threw up the sash, to refresh herself with the morning air. She (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) felt excessively fatigued, and in the hurry of her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) mind she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) could not think of any thing distinctly. She (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) took off her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) masquerade dress, and went to bed in hopes of forgetting, for a few hours, what she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) felt indelibly impressed upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) imagination. But it was in vain that she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) endeavoured to compose herself to sleep; her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) ideas were in too great and painful confusion. For some time, whenever she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) closed her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) eyes, the face and form of Lady Delacour, such as she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) had just beheld them, seemed to haunt her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>); afterwards, the idea of Clarence Hervey, and the painful recollection of the conversation she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) had overheard, recurred to her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>): the words, <div class="bookquote">``Do you think I don't know that Belinda Portman is a composition of art and affectation?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>were fixed in her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) memory. She (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) recollected with the utmost minuteness every look of contempt which she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) had seen in the faces of the young men whilst they spoke of Mrs Stanhope, the match-maker. Belinda's mind, however, was not yet sufficiently calm to reflect; she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) seemed only to live over again the preceding night. At last, the strange motley figures which she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) had seen at the masquerade flitted before her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) eyes, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) sunk into an uneasy slumber.

<p/>CHAPTER III

<p/>Lady Delacour's History

<p/>MISS PORTMAN was awakened by the ringing of Lady Delacour's bedchamber bell. She (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) opened her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) eyes with the confused idea that something disagreeable had happened; and before she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) had distinctly recollected herself, Marriott came to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) bedside, with a note from Lady Delacour: it was written with a pencil.

<p/>``DELACOUR -- my lord!!!! is to have to-day what Garrick used to call a gander feast -- will you dine with me tête-à-tête, and I'll write an excuse, alias a lie, to Lady Singleton, in the form of a charming note -- I pique myself sur l'éloquence du billet -- then we shall have the evening to ourselves. I have much to say, as people usually have when they begin to talk of themselves.
``I have taken a double dose of opium, and am not so horribly out of spirits as I was last night; so you need not be afraid of another scene.

<p/>``Let me see you in my dressing-room, dear Belinda, as soon as you have adored

<p/><div class="bookquote">``With head uncover'd the cosmetic powers.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>But you don't paint -- no matter -- you will -- you must -- every body must, sooner or later. In the mean time, whenever you want to send a note that shall not be opened by the bearer, put your trust neither in wafer nor wax, but twist it as I twist mine. You see I wish to put you in possession of some valuable secrets before I leave this world -- this, by-the-bye, I don't upon second thoughts, which are always best, mean to do yet. There certainly were such people as Amazons -- I hope you admire them -- for who could live without the admiration of Belinda Portman? -- not Clarence Hervey assuredly -- nor yet
<div class="bookquote">``T.C.H. DELACOUR .''


 (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div><p/>Belinda obeyed the summons to her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) ladyship's dressing-room: she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) found Lady Delacour with her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) face completely repaired with paint, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) spirits with opium. She (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) was in high consultation with Marriott and Mrs Franks, the milliner, about the crape petticoat of her (<font color='blue'><b>Franks</b></font>) birth-night dress, which was extended over a large hoop in full state. Mrs Franks descanted long and learnedly upon festoons and loops, knots and fringes, submitting all the time every thing to her (<font color='blue'><b>Franks</b></font>) ladyship's better judgment.

<p/>Marriott was sulky and silent. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) opened her (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) lips but once upon the question of laburnum or no laburnum flowers.

<p/>Against them she (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) quoted the memoirs and authority of the celebrated Mrs Bellamy, who has a case in point to prove that `straw colour must ever look like dirty white by candlelight.<div class="bookquote">'' Mrs Franks, to compromise the matter, proposed gold laburnums, `because nothing can look better by candlelight, or any light, than gold,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Mrs Bellamy</b></font>)</div>and Lady Delacour, who was afraid that the milliner's imagination, now that it had once touched upon gold, might be led to the vulgar idea of ready money, suddenly broke up the conference, by exclaiming,

<p/>``We shall be late at Phillip's exhibition of French china. Mrs Franks must let us see her (<font color='blue'><b>Franks</b></font>) again to-morrow, to take into consideration your court dress, my dear Belinda -- ``Miss Portman presented by Lady Delacour<div class="bookquote">'' -- Mrs Franks, let her (<font color='blue'><b>Franks</b></font>) dress, for heaven's sake, be something that will make a fine paragraph: -- I give you four-and-twenty hours to think of it. I have done a horrid act this day,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>continued she (<font color='blue'><b>Franks</b></font>), after Mrs Franks had left the room -- `absolutely written a twisted note to Clarence Hervey, my dear -- but why did I tell you that? Now your head will run upon the twisted note all day, instead of upon <div class="bookquote">``The Life and Opinions of a Lady of Quality, related by herself.'' (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>'

<p/>After dinner Lady Delacour having made Belinda protest and blush, and blush and protest, that her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) head was not running upon the twisted note, began the history of her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) life and opinions in the following manner: --

<p/>``I do nothing by halves, my dear. I shall not tell you my adventures as Gil Blas told his (<font color='blue'><b>Gil</b></font>) to the County d``Olivarez -- skipping over the useful passages. I am no hypocrite, and have nothing worse than folly to conceal: that's bad enough -- for a woman who is known to play the fool is always suspected of playing the devil. But I begin where I ought to end -- with my moral, which I dare say you are not impatient to anticipate. I never read or listened to a moral at the end of a story in my life: -- manners for me, and morals for those that like them. My dear, you will be woefully disappointed if in my story you expect any thing like a novel. I once heard a general say, that nothing was less like a review than a battle; and I can tell you that nothing is more unlike a novel than real life. Of all lives, mine has been the least romantic. No love in it, but a great deal of hate. I was a rich heiress -- I had, I believe, a hundred thousand pounds, or more, and twice as many caprices: I was handsome and witty -- or, to speak with that kind of circumlocution which is called humility, the world, the partial world, thought me a beauty and a bel-esprit. Having told you my fortune, need I add, that I, or it, had lovers in abundance -- of all sorts and degrees -- not to reckon those, it may be presumed, who died of concealed passions for me? I had sixteen declarations and proposals in form; then what in the name of wonder, or of common sense -- which by-the-bye is the greatest of wonders -- what, in the name of common sense, made me marry Lord Delacour? Why, my dear, you -- no, not you, but any girl who is not used to have a parcel of admirers, would think it the easiest thing in the world to make her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) choice; but let her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) judge by what she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) feels when a dexterous mercer or linen-draper produces pretty thing after pretty thing -- and this is so becoming, and this will wear for ever, as he (<font color='blue'><b>mercer</b></font>) swears; but then that's so fashionable; -- the novice stands in a charming perplexity, and after examining, and doubting, and tossing over half the goods in the shop, it's ten to one, when it begins to get late, the young lady, in a hurry, pitches upon the very ugliest and worst thing that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) has seen. Just so it was with me and my lovers, and just so

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sad was the hour, and luckless was the day,''
 (<font color='red'><b>lovers</b></font>)</div>I pitched upon Viscount Delacour for my lord and judge. He (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) had just at that time lost at Newmarket more than he (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) was worth in every sense of the word; and my fortune was the most convenient thing in the world to a man in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) condition. Lozenges are of sovereign use in some complaints. The heiress lozenge is a specific in some consumptions. You are surprised that I can laugh and jest about such a melancholy thing as my marriage with Lord Delacour; and so am I, especially when I recollect all the circumstances; for though I bragged of there being no love in my history, there was when I was a goose or a gosling of about eighteen -- just your age, Belinda, I think -- something very like love playing about my heart, or my head. There was a certain Henry Percival, a Clarence Hervey of a man -- no, he (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) had ten times the sense, begging your pardon, of Clarence Hervey -- his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) misfortune, or mine, was, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) had too much sense -- he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) was in love with me, but not with my faults; now I, wisely considering that my faults were the greatest part of me, insisted upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) being in love with my faults. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) wouldn't or couldn't -- I said wouldn't, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) said couldn't. I had been used to see the men about me lick the dust at my feet, for it was gold dust. Percival made wry faces -- Lord Delacour made none. I pointed him (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) out to Percival as an example -- it was an example he (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) would not follow. I was provoked, and I married in hopes of provoking the man I loved. The worst of it was, I did not provoke him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) as much as I expected. Six months afterwards I heard of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) marriage with a very amiable woman. I hate those very amiable women. Poor Percival! I should have been a very happy woman, I fancy, if I had married you -- for I believe you were the only man who ever really loved me; but all that is over now! -- Where were we? O, I married my Lord Delacour, knowing him (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) to be a fool, and believing that, for this reason, I should find no trouble in governing him (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>). But what a fatal mistake! -- a fool, of all animals in the creation, is the most difficult to govern. We set out in the fashionable world with a mutual desire to be as extravagant as possible. Strange, that with this similarity of taste we could never agree! -- strange, that this similarity of tastes was the cause of our perpetual quarrels! During the first year of our marriage, I had always the upper hand in these disputes, and the last word; and I was content. Stubborn as the brute was, I thought I should in time break him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) in. From the specimens you have seen, you may guess that I was even then a tolerable proficient in the dear art of tormenting. I had almost gained my point, just broken my lord's heart, when one fair morning I unluckily told his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) man Champfort that he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) knew no more how to cut hair that a sheep-shearer. Champfort, who is conceit personified, took mortal offence at this; and the devil, who is always at hand to turn anger into malice, put it into my lord's head, that the world thought -- <div class="bookquote">``My lady governed him (<font color='blue'><b>novice</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>lord</b></font>)</div>My lord took fire. They say the torpedo, the coldest of cold creatures, sometimes gives out a spark -- I suppose when electrified with anger. The next time that innocent I insisted upon my Lord Delacour's doing or not doing -- I forget which -- the most reasonable thing in the world, my lord turns short round, and answers -- <div class="bookquote">``My Lady Delacour, I am not a man to be governed by a wife.''  (<font color='red'><b>lord</b></font>)</div>-- And from that time to this the words, <div class="bookquote">``I am not a man to be governed by a wife,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>have been written in his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) obstinate face, as all the world can read the human countenance may see. My dear, I laugh; but even in the midst of laughter there is sadness. But you don't know what it is -- I hope you never may -- to have an obstinate fool for a bosom friend.
``I at first flattered myself that my lord's was not an inveterate, incurable malady: but from his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) obvious weakness, I might have seen that there was no hope; for cases of obstinacy are always dangerous in proportion to the weakness of the patient. My lord's case was desperate. Kill or cure was my humane or prudent maxim. I determined to try the poison of jealousy, by way of an alternative. I had long kept it in petto as my ultimate remedy. I fixed upon a proper subject -- a man with whom I thought that I could coquette to all eternity, without any danger to myself -- a certain Colonel Lawless, as empty a coxcomb as you would wish to see. The world, said I to myself, can never be so absurd as to suspect Lady Delacour with such a man as this, though her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) lord may, and will; for nothing is too absurd for him (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) to believe. Half my theory proved just; that is saying a great deal for any theory. My lord swallowed the remedy that I had prepared for him (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) with an avidity and a bonhommie which it did me good to behold; my remedy operated beyond my most sanguine expectations. The poor man was cured of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) obstinacy, and become stark mad with jealousy. Then indeed I had some hopes of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>); for a madman can be managed, a fool cannot. In a month's time I made him (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) quite docile. With a face longer than the weeping philosopher's, he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) came to me one morning, and assured me, <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) would do every thing I pleased, provided I would consult my own honour and his (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>), and give up Colonel Lawless.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>'<div class="bookquote">``Give up!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>-- I could hardly forbear laughing at the expression. I replied, <div class="bookquote">``that as long as my lord treated me with becoming respect, I had never in thought or deed given him (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) just cause of complaint; but that I was not a woman to be insulted, or to be kept, as I had hitherto been, in leading-strings by a husband.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>My lord, flattered as I meant he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) should be with the idea that it was possible he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) should be suspected of keeping a wife in leading-strings, fell to making protestations -- ``He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) hoped his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) future conduct would prove, &c. Upon this hint, I gave the reins to my imagination, and full drive I went into a fresh career of extravagance: if I were checked, it was an insult, and I began directly to talk of leading-strings. This ridiculous game I played successfully enough for some time, till at length, though naturally rather slow at calculation, he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) actually discovered, that if we lived at the rate of twenty thousand a-year, and had only ten thousand a-year to spend, we should in due time have nothing left. This notable discovery he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) communicated to me one morning, after a long preamble. When he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had finished prosing, I agreed that it was demonstrably just that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) should retrench his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) expenses; but that it was equally unjust and impossible that I could make any reformation in my civil list: that economy was a word which I had never heard of in my life till I married his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) lordship; that, upon second recollection, it was true I had heard of such a thing as national economy, and that it would be a very pretty, though rather hackneyed topic of declamation for a maiden speech in the House of Lords. I therefore advised him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) to reserve all he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had to say upon the subject for the noble lord upon the woolsack; nay, I very graciously added, that upon this condition I would go to the house myself to give his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) arguments and eloquence a fair hearing, and that I would do my best to keep myself awake. This was all mighty playful and witty; but it happened that my Lord Delacour, who never had any great taste for wit, could not this unlucky morning at all relish it. Of course I grew angry, and reminded him (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>), with an indelicacy which his (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) want of generosity justified, that an heiress, who had brought a hundred thousand pounds into his (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) family, had some right to amuse herself, and that it was not my fault if elegant amusements were more expensive than others.

<p/>``Then came a long criminating and recriminating chapter. It was, ``My lord, your Newmarket blunders<div class="bookquote">'' -- ''  (<font color='red'><b>Newmarket</b></font>)</div>My lady, your cursed theatricals '' -- ``My lord, I have surely a right'' -- and, <div class="bookquote">``My lady, I have surely as good a right.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>``But, my dear Belinda, however we might pay one another, we could not pay all the world with words. In short, after running though thousands and tens of thousands, we were actually in distress for money. Then came selling of lands, and I don't know what devices for raising money, according to the modes of lawyers and attorneys. It was quite indifferent to me how they got money, provided they did get it. By what art these gentlemen raised money, I never troubled myself to inquire; it might have been the black art, for any thing I know to the contrary. I know nothing of business. So I signed all the papers they brought to me; and I was mighty well pleased to find, that by so easy an expedient as writing ``T.C.H. Delacour,'' I could command money at will. I signed, and signed, till at last I was with all due civility informed that my signature was no longer worth a farthing; and when I came to inquire into the cause of this phenomenon, I could nowise understand what my Lord Delacour's lawyer said to me: he (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) was a prig, and I had not patience either to listen to him (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) or to look at him (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>). I sent for an old uncle of mine, who used to manage all my money matters before I was married; I put the uncle and the lawyer into a room, together with their parchments, to fight the matter out, or to come to a right understanding if they could. The last, it seems, was quite impossible. In the course of half an hour, out comes my uncle in such a rage! I never shall forget his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) face -- all the bile in his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) body had gotten into it; he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) had literally no whites to his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) eyes. ``My dear uncle,'' said I, <div class="bookquote">``what is the matter! Why, you are absolutely gold stick in waiting!''

 (<font color='red'><b>uncle</b></font>)</div><p/>'<div class="bookquote">``No matter what I am, child,''  (<font color='red'><b>the uncle</b></font>)</div>said the uncle; <div class="bookquote">``I'll tell you what you are, with all your wit -- a dupe: `tis a shame for a woman of your sense to be such a fool, and to know nothing of business; and if you knew nothing yourself, could not you send for me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the uncle</b></font>)</div><p/>'<div class="bookquote">``I was too ignorant to know that I know nothing,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I. But I will not trouble you with all the said I's and said he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>)'s. I was made to understand, that if Lord Delacour were to die the next day, I should live a beggar. Upon this I grew serious, as you may imagine. My uncle assured me that I had been grossly imposed upon by my lord and his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) lawyer; and that I had been swindled out of my senses, and out of my dower. I repeated all that my uncle said, very faithfully, to Lord Delacour; and all that either he (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) or his (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) lawyer could furnish out by way of answer was, that <div class="bookquote">``Necessity had no law.''  (<font color='red'><b>lawyer</b></font>)</div>Necessity, it must be allowed, though it might be the mother of law, was never with my lord the mother of invention. Having now found out that I had a good right to complain, I indulged myself in it most gloriously; in short, my dear, we had a comfortable family quarrel. Love quarrels are easily made up, but of money quarrels there is no end. From the moment these money quarrels commenced, I began to hate Lord Delacour; before, I had only despised him (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>). You can have no notion to what meanness extravagance reduces men. I have known Lord Delacour shirk, and look so shabby, and tell so many lies to people about a hundred guineas -- a hundred guineas! -- what do I say! -- about twenty, ten, five! O, my dear, I cannot bear the thoughts of it!

<p/>``But I was going on to tell you, that my good uncle and all my relations quarrelled with me for having ruined myself, as they said; but I said they quarrelled with me for fear I should ask them for some of their ``vile trash.'' Accordingly, I abused and ridiculed them, one and all; and for my pains, all my acquaintances said, that <div class="bookquote">``Lady Delacour was a woman of a vast deal of spirit.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``We were relieved from our money embarrassments by the timely death of a rich nobleman, to whose large estate my Lord Delacour was heir-at-law. I was intoxicated with the idle compliments of all my acquaintance, and I endeavoured to console myself for misery at home by gaiety abroad. Ambitious of pleasing universally, I became the worst of slaves -- a slave to the world. Not a moment of my time was at my own disposal -- not one of my actions; I may say, not one of my thoughts was my own; I was obliged to find things <div class="bookquote">``charming''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>every hour, which tired me to death; and every day it was the same dull round of hypocrisy and dissipation. You wonder to hear me speak in this manner, Belinda -- but one must speak the truth sometimes; and this is what I have been saying to Harriot Freke continually for these ten years past. Then why persist in the same kind of life? you say. Why, my dear, because I could not stop: I was fit for this kind of life and no other: I could not be happy at home; for what sort of companion could I have made of Lord Delacour? By this time he (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) was tired of his (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) horse Potatoe, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) horse Highflyer, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) horse Eclipse, and Goliah, and Jenny Grey, &c.; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) had taken to hard drinking, which soon turned him (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>), as you see, quite into a beast.

<p/>``I forgot to tell you that I had three children during the first five years of my marriage. The first was a boy: he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was born dead; and my lord, and all his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) odious relations, laid the blame upon me, because I would not be kept prisoner half a year by an old mother of his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>), a vile Cassandra, who was always prophesying that my child would not be born alive. My second child was a girl; but a poor diminutive, sickly thing. It was the fashion at this time for fine mothers to suckle their own children; so much the worse for the poor brats. Fine nurses never made fine children. There was a prodigious rout made about the matter; a vast deal of sentiment and sympathy, and compliments and inquiries; but after the novelty was over, I became heartily sick of the business; and at the end of about three months my poor child was sick too -- I don't much like to think of it -- it died. If I had put it out to nurse, I should have been thought by my friends an unnatural mother; but I should have saved its life. I should have bewailed the loss of the infant more, if Lord Delacour's relations and my own had not made such lamentations upon the occasion that I was stunned. I couldn't or wouldn't shed a tear; and I left it to the old dowager to perform in public, as she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) wished, the part of chief mourner, and to comfort herself in private by lifting up her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) hands and eyes, and railing at me as the most insensible of mothers. All this time I suffered more than she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) did; but that is what she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) shall never have the satisfaction of knowing. I determined, that if ever I had another child, I would not have the barbarity to nurse it myself. Accordingly when my third child, a girl, was born, I sent it off immediately to the country, to a stout, healthy, broad-faced nurse, under whose care it grew and flourished; so that at three years old, when it was brought back to me, I could scarcely believe the chubby little thing was my own child. The same reasons which convinced me I ought not to nurse my own child, determined me, à plus forte raison, not to undertake its education. Lord Delacour could not bear the child, because it was not a boy. The girl was put under the care of a governess, who plagued my heart out with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) airs and tracasseries for three or four years; at the end of which time, as she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) turned out to be Lord Delacour's mistress in form, I was obliged -- in form -- to beg she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) would leave my house: and I put her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) pupil into better hands, I hope, at a celebrated academy for young ladies. There she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) will, at any rate, be better instructed than she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) could be at home. I beg your pardon, my dear, for this digression on nursing and schooling; but I wanted only to explain to you why it was that, when I was weary of the business, I still went on in a course of dissipation. You see I had nothing at home, either in the shape of husband or children, to engage my affections. I believe it was this ``aching void'' in my heart which made me, after looking abroad some time for a bosom friend, take such a prodigious fancy to Mrs Freke. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>) was just then coming into fashion; she (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>) struck me, the first time I met her (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>), as being downright ugly; but there was a wild oddity in her (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>) countenance which made one stare at her (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>) was delighted to be stared at, especially by me; so we were mutually agreeable to each other -- I as starer, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>) as staree. Harriot Freke had, without comparison, more assurance than any man or woman I ever saw; she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was downright brass, but of the finest kind -- Corinthian brass. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was one of the first who brought what I call harum scarum manners into fashion. I told you that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had assurance -- impudence I should have called it, for no other word is strong enough. Such things as I have heard Harriot Freke say! -- You will not believe it -- but her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) conversation at first absolutely made me, like an old-fashioned fool, wish I had a fan to play with. But, to my astonishment, all this took surprisingly with a set of fashionable young men. I found it necessary to reform my manners. If I had not taken heart of grace, and publicly abjured the heresies of false delicacy, I should have been excommunicated. Lady Delacour's sprightly elegance -- allow me to speak of myself in the style in which the newspaper writers talk of me -- Lady Delacour's sprightly elegance was but pale, not to say faded pink, compared with the scarlet of Mrs Freke's dashing audacity. As my rival, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>) would on certain ground have beat me hollow; it was therefore good policy to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>) my friend: we joined forces, and nothing could stand against us. But I have no right to give myself credit for good policy in forming this intimacy; I really followed the dictates of my heart or my imagination. There was a frankness in Harriot's manner which I mistook for artlessness or character: she (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>) spoke with such unbounded freedom on certain subjects, that I gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>) credit for unbounded sincerity on all subjects: she (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>) had the talent of making the world believe that virtue to be invulnerable by nature which disdained the common outworks of art for its defence. I, amongst others, took it for granted, that the woman who could make it her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) sport to ``touch the brink of all we hate,'' must have a stronger head than other people. I have since been convinced, however, of my mistake. I am persuaded that few can touch the brink without tumbling headlong down the precipice. Don't apply this, my dear, literally, to the person of whom we were speaking; I am not base enough to betray her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) secrets, however I may have been provoked by her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) treachery. Of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) character and history you shall hear nothing but what is necessary for my own justification. The league of amity between us was scarcely ratified before my Lord Delacour came, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) wise remonstrating face, to beg me ``to consider what was due to my own honour and his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>).'' Like the cosmogony-man in the Vicar of Wakefield, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) came out over and over with this cant phrase, which had once stood him (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) in stead. ``Do you think, my lord,'' said I, <div class="bookquote">``that because I gave up poor Lawless to oblige you, I shall give up all common sense to suit myself to your taste? Harriot Freke is visited by every body but old dowagers and old maids: I am neither an old dowager nor an old maid -- the consequence is obvious, my lord.''  (<font color='red'><b>lord</b></font>)</div>Pertness in dialogue, my dear, often succeeds better with my lord than wit: I therefore saved the sterling gold, and bestowed upon him (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) nothing but counters. I tell you this to save the credit of my taste and judgment.

<p/>``But to return to my friendship for Harriot Freke. I, of course, repeated to her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) every word which had passed between my husband and me. She (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) out-heroded Herod upon the occasion; and laughed so much at what she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) called my folly in pleading guilty in the Lawless case, that I was downright ashamed of myself, and, purely to prove my innocence, I determined, upon the first convenient opportunity, to renew my intimacy with the colonel. The opportunity which I so ardently desired of redeeming my independence was not long wanting. Lawless, as my stars -LRB-which you know are always more in fault than ourselves-RRB- would have it, returned just at this time from the continent, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Lawless</b></font>) had been with his (<font color='blue'><b>Lawless</b></font>) regiment; he (<font color='blue'><b>Lawless</b></font>) returned with a wound across his (<font color='blue'><b>Lawless</b></font>) forehead and a black fillet, which made him (<font color='blue'><b>Lawless</b></font>) look something more like a hero, and ten times more like a coxcomb, than ever. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lawless</b></font>) was in fashion, at all events; and amongst other ladies, Mrs Luttridge, odious Mrs Luttridge! smiled upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Lawless</b></font>). The colonel, however, had taste enough to know the difference between smile and smile: he (<font color='blue'><b>colonel</b></font>) laid himself and his (<font color='blue'><b>colonel</b></font>) laurels at my feet, and I carried him (<font color='blue'><b>colonel</b></font>) and them about in triumph. Wherever I went, especially to Mrs Luttridge's, envy and scandal joined hands to attack me, and I heard wondering and whispering wherever I went. I had no object in view but to provoke my husband; therefore, conscious of the purity of my intentions, it was my delight to brave the opinion of the wondering world. I gave myself no concern about the effect my coquetry might have upon the object of this flirtation. Poor Lawless! Heart, I took it for granted, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lawless</b></font>) had none; how should a coxcomb come by a heart? Vanity I knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Lawless</b></font>) had in abundance, but this gave me no alarm, as I thought that if it should ever make him (<font color='blue'><b>Lawless</b></font>) forget himself, I mean forget what was due to me, I could, by one flash of my wit, strike him (<font color='blue'><b>Lawless</b></font>) to the earth, or blast him (<font color='blue'><b>Lawless</b></font>) for ever. One night we had been together at Mrs Luttridge's; -- she (<font color='blue'><b>Luttridge</b></font>), amongst other good things, kept a faro bank, and, I am convinced, cheated. Be that as it may, I lost an immensity of money, and it was my pride to lose with as much gaiety as any body else could win; so I was, or appeared to be, in uncommonly high spirits, and Lawless had his (<font color='blue'><b>Lawless</b></font>) share of my good humour. We left Mrs Luttridge's together early, about half-past one. As the colonel was going to hand me to my carriage, a smart-looking young man, as I thought, came up close to the coach door, and stared me full in the face: I was not a woman to be disconcerted at such a thing as this, but I really was startled when the young fellow jumped into the carriage after me: I thought he (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) was mad: I had only courage enough to scream. Lawless seized hold of the intruder to drag him (<font color='blue'><b>Lawless</b></font>) out, and out he (<font color='blue'><b>Lawless</b></font>) dragged the youth, exclaiming, in a high tone, ``What is the meaning of all this, sir? Who the devil are you? My name's Lawless: who the devil are you?'' The answer to this was a convulsion of laughter. By the laugh I knew it to be Harriot Freke. ``Who am I? only a Freke!'' cried she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>): ``shake hands.'' I gave her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) my hand, into the carriage she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) sprang, and desired the colonel to follow her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>): Lawless laughed, we all laughed, and drove away. ``Where do you think I've been?'' said Harriot; ``in the gallery of the House of Commons; almost squeezed to death these four hours; but I swore I'd hear Sheridan's speech to-night, and I did; betted fifty guineas I would with Mrs Luttridge, and have won. Fun and Freke for ever, huzza!'' Harriot was mad with spirits, and so noisy and unmanageable, that, as I told her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>), I was sure she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) was drunk. Lawless, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lawless</b></font>) silly way, laughed incessantly, and I was so taken up with her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) oddities that, for the some time, I did not perceive we were going the Lord knows where; till, at last, when the `larum of Harriot's voice ceased for an instant, I was struck with the strange sound of the carriage. ``Where are we? not upon the stones, I'm sure,'' said I; and putting my head out of the window, I saw we were beyond the turnpike. ``The coachman's drunk as well as you, Harriot,'' said I; and I was going to pull the string to stop him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>), but Harriot had hold of it. ``The man is going very right,'' said she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>); ``I've told him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) where to go. Now don't fancy that Lawless and I are going to run away with you. All this is unnecessary now-a-days, thank God!'' To this I agreed, and laughed for fear of being ridiculous. <div class="bookquote">``Guess where you are going,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Harriot. I guessed and guessed, but could not guess right; and my merry companions were infinitely diverted with my perplexity and impatience, more especially as, I believe, in spite of all my efforts, I grew rather graver than usual. We went on to the end of Sloane-street, and quite out of town; at last we stopped. It was dark; the footman's flambeau was out; I could only just see by the lamps that we were at the door of a lone, odd-looking house. The house door opened, and an old woman appeared with a lantern in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hand.

<p/>'<div class="bookquote">``Where is this farce, or freak, or whatever you call it, to end?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, as Harriot pulled me into the dark passage along with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Alas! my dear Belinda,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>said Lady Delacour, pausing, ``I little foresaw where or how it was to end. But I am not come yet to the tragical part of my story, and as long as I can laugh I will. As the old woman and her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) miserable light went on before us, I could almost have thought of Sir Bertrand, or of some German horrifications; but I heard Lawless, who never could help laughing at the wrong time, bursting behind me, with a sense of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lawless</b></font>) own superiority.

<p/>'<div class="bookquote">``Now you will learn your destiny, Lady Delacour!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harriot/Harriot Freke/Freke</b></font>)</div>said Harriot, in a solemn tone.

<p/>'<div class="bookquote">``Yes! from the celebrated Mrs W--, the modern dealer in art magic,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, laughing, <div class="bookquote">``for, now I guess whereabouts I am. Colonel Lawless's laugh broke the spell. Harriot Freke, never whilst you live expect to succeed in the sublime.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Harriot swore at the colonel for the veriest spoil-sport she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) had ever seen, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) whispered to me -- <div class="bookquote">``The reason he (<font color='blue'><b>Lawless</b></font>) laughs is because he (<font color='blue'><b>Lawless</b></font>) is afraid of our suspecting the truth of him (<font color='blue'><b>Lawless</b></font>), that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lawless</b></font>) believes tout de bon in conjuration, and the devil, and all that.''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>The old woman, whose cue I found was to be dumb, opened a door at the top of a narrow staircase, and pointing to a tall figure, completely enveloped in fur, left us to our fate. I will not trouble you with a pompous description of all the mummery of the scene, my dear, as I despair of being able to frighten you out of your wits. I should have been downright angry with Harriot Freke for bringing me to such a place, but that I knew women of the first fashion had been with Mrs W-- before us -- some in sober sadness, some by way of frolic. So as there was no fear of being ridiculous, there was no shame, you know, and my conscience was quite at ease. Harriot had no conscience, so she (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>) was always at ease; and never more so than in male attire, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>) had been told became her (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>) particularly. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>) supported the character of a young rake with such spirit and truth, that I am sure no common conjuror could have discovered any thing feminine about her (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>) rattled on with a set of nonsensical questions; and among other things she (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>) asked, <div class="bookquote">``How soon will Lady Delacour marry again after her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) lord's death?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>'<div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) will never marry after her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) lord's death,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>answered the oracle. <div class="bookquote">``The she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) will marry during his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) lifetime,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harriot/Harriot Freke/Freke</b></font>)</div>said Harriot. <div class="bookquote">``True,''  (<font color='red'><b>Colonel</b></font>)</div>answered the oracle. Colonel Lawless laughed; I was angry; and the colonel would have been quiet, for he (<font color='blue'><b>colonel</b></font>) was a gentleman, but there was no such thing as managing Mrs Freke, who, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Freke</b></font>) had laid aside the modest of her (<font color='blue'><b>Freke</b></font>) own sex, had not acquired the decency of the other. <div class="bookquote">``Who is to be Lady Delacour's second husband?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>cried she (<font color='blue'><b>Freke</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``you'll not offend the present company by naming the man.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) second husband I cannot name,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Freke</b></font>)</div>replied the oracle, <div class="bookquote">``but let her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) beware of a Lawless lover.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Freke</b></font>)</div>Mrs Freke and Colonel Lawless, encouraged by her (<font color='blue'><b>Freke</b></font>), triumphed over me without mercy -- I may say, without shame! Well, my dear, I am in a hurry to have done with all this: though I <div class="bookquote">``doted upon folly,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>yet I was terrified at the thoughts of any thing worse. The idea of a divorce, the public brand of a shameful life, shocked me in spite of all my real and all my assumed levity. O that I had, at this instant, dared to be myself! But my fear of ridicule was greater than my fear of vice. <div class="bookquote">``Bless me, my dear Lady Delacour,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harriot/Harriot Freke/Freke</b></font>)</div>whispered Harriot, as we left this house, <div class="bookquote">``what can make you in such a desperate hurry to get home? You gape and fidget: one would think you had never sat up a night before in your life. I verily believe you are afraid to trust yourself with us. Which of us are you afraid of, Lawless, or me, or yourself? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Harriot/Harriot Freke/Freke</b></font>)</div>There was a tone of contempt in the last words which piqued me to the quick; and however strange it may seem, I was now anxious only to convince Harriot that I was not afraid of myself. False shame made me act as if I had no shame. You would not suspect me of knowing any thing of false shame, but depend upon it, my dear, many, who appear to have as much assurance as I have, are secretly its slaves. I moralize, because I am come to a part of my story which I should almost be glad to omit; but I promised you that there should be no sins of omission. It was light, but not broad daylight, when we got to Knightsbridge. Lawless, encouraged -LRB-for I cannot deny it-RRB- by the levity of my manner, as well as of Harriot's, was in higher and more familiar spirits than I ever saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Lawless</b></font>). Mrs Freke desired me to set her (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>) down at her (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>) sister's, who lived in Grosvenor-place: I did so, and I beg you to believe that I was in an agony, to get rid of my colonel at the same time; but you know I could not, before Harriot Freke, absolutely say to him (<font color='blue'><b>colonel</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``Get out!''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Indeed, to tell things as they were, it was scarcely possible to guess by my manner that I was under any anxiety, I acted my part so well, or so ill. As Harriot Freke jumped out of the coach, a cock crowed in the area of her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) sister's house: <div class="bookquote">``There!''  (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div>cried Harriot, <div class="bookquote">``do you hear the cock crow, Lady Delacour? Now it's to be hoped your fear of goblins is over, else I would not be so cruel as to leave the pretty dear all alone.''  (<font color='red'><b>Harriot/Harriot Freke/Freke</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``All alone!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>answered I: <div class="bookquote">``your friend the colonel is much obliged to you for making nobody of him (<font color='blue'><b>colonel</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``My friend the colonel,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harriot/Harriot Freke/Freke</b></font>)</div>whispered Harriot, leaning with her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) bold masculine arms on the coach door -- <div class="bookquote">``my friend the colonel is much obliged to me, I'm sure, for remembering what the cunning or the knowing woman told us just now: so when I said I left you alone, I was not guilty of a bull, was I?''  (<font color='red'><b>coach</b></font>)</div>I had the grace to be heartily ashamed of this speech, and called out, in utter confusion, <div class="bookquote">``To Berkley-square. But where shall I set you down, colonel? Harriot, good morning: don't forget you are in man's clothes.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I did not dare to repeat the question of <div class="bookquote">``where shall I set you down, colonel?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>at this instant, because Harriot gave me such an arch, sneering look, as much as to say, <div class="bookquote">``Still afraid of yourself!''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>We drove on: I'm persuaded that the confusion which, in spite of all my efforts, broke through my affected levity, encouraged Lawless, who was naturally a coxcomb and a fool, to believe that I was actually his (<font color='blue'><b>Lawless</b></font>), else he (<font color='blue'><b>Lawless</b></font>) never could have been so insolent. In short, my dear, before we had got through the turnpike gate, I was downright obliged to say to him (<font color='blue'><b>Lawless</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``Get out!''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>which I did with a degree of indignation that quite astonished him (<font color='blue'><b>Lawless</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Lawless</b></font>) muttered something about ladies knowing their minds; and I own, though I went off with flying colours, I secretly blamed myself as much as I did him (<font color='blue'><b>Lawless</b></font>), and I blamed Harriot more than I did either. I sent for her (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) the next day, as soon as I could, to consult her (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) expressed such astonishment, and so much concern at this catastrophe of our night's frolic, and blamed herself with so many oaths, and execrated Lawless for a coxcomb, so much to the ease and satisfaction of my conscience, that I was confirmed in my good opinion of her (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>), and indeed felt for her (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) the most lively affection and esteem; for observe, with me esteem ever followed affection, instead of affection following esteem. Woe be to all who in morals preposterously put the cart before the horse! But to proceed with my history: all fashionable historians stop to make reflections, supposing that no one else can have the sense to make any. My esteemed friend agreed with me that it would be best for all parties concerned to hush up this business; that as Lawless was going out of town in a few days, to be elected for a borough, we should get rid of him (<font color='blue'><b>Lawless</b></font>) in the best way possible, without <div class="bookquote">``more last words;''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lawless</b></font>) had been punished sufficiently on the spot, and that to punish twice for the same offence, once in private and once in public, would be contrary to the laws of Englishmen and Englishwomen, and in my case would be contrary to the evident dictates of prudence, because I could not complain without calling upon Lord Delacour to call Lawless out; this I could not do without acknowledging that his (<font color='blue'><b>Lawless</b></font>) lordship had been in the right, in warning me about his (<font color='blue'><b>Lawless</b></font>) honour and my own, which old phrase I dreaded to hear for the ninety-ninth time: besides, Lord Delacour was the last man in the world I should have chosen for my knight, though unluckily he (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) was my lord; besides, all things considered, I thought the whole story might not tell so well in the world for me, tell it which way I would: we therefore agreed that it would be most expedient to hold our tongues. We took it for granted that Lawless would hold his (<font color='blue'><b>Lawless</b></font>), and as for my people, they knew nothing, I thought, or if they did, I was sure of them. How the thing got abroad I could not at the time conceive, though now I am well acquainted with the baseness and treachery of the woman I called my friend. The affair was known and talked of every where the next day, and the story was told especially at odious Mrs Luttridge's, with such exaggerations as drove me almost mad. I was enraged, inconceivably enraged with Lawless, from whom I imagined the reports originated.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I was venting my indignation against him (<font color='blue'><b>colonel</b></font>) in a room full of company, where I had just made my story good, when a gentleman, to whom I was a stranger, came in breathless, with the news that Colonel Lawless was killed in a duel by Lord Delacour; that they were carrying him (<font color='blue'><b>Lawless</b></font>) home to his (<font color='blue'><b>Lawless</b></font>) mother's, and that the body was just going by the door. The company all crowded to the windows immediately, and I was left standing alone till I could stand no longer. What was said or done after this I do not remember; I only know that when I came to myself, the most dreadful sensation I ever experienced was the certainty that I had the blood of a fellow-creature to answer for. -- I wonder,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>said Lady Delacour, breaking off at this part of her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) history, and rising suddenly, <div class="bookquote">``I wonder what is become of Marriott! -- surely it is time for me to have my drops. Miss Portman, have the goodness to ring, for I must have something immediately.''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>Belinda was terrified at the wildness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) manner. Lady Delacour became more composed, or put more constraint upon herself, at the sight of Marriott. Marriott brought from the closet in her (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) lady's room the drops, which Lady Delacour swallowed with precipitation. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) ordered coffee, and afterward chasse-café, and at last, turning to Belinda, with a forced smile, she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) said --

<p/>The same continued

<p/>``I LEFT off with the true skill of a good story-teller, at the most interesting part -- a duel; and yet duels are so common now that they are really vulgar incidents.

<p/>``But we think that a duel concerning ourselves must be more extraordinary than any other. We hear of men being shot in duels about nothing every day, so it is really a weakness in me to think so much about poor Lawless's death, as Harriot Freke said to me at the time. She (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) expected to see me show sorrow in public; but very fortunately for me, she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) roused my pride, which was always stronger than my reason; and I behaved myself upon the occasion as became a fine lady. There were some things, however, I could hardly stand. You must know that Lawless, fool and coxcomb as he (<font color='blue'><b>Lawless</b></font>) was, had some magnanimity, and showed it -- as some people do from whom it is least expected -- on his (<font color='blue'><b>Lawless</b></font>) death-bed. The last words he (<font color='blue'><b>Lawless</b></font>) said were, ``Lady Delacour is innocent -- I charge you, don't prosecute Lord Delacour.'' This he (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) said to his (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) mother, who, to complete my misery, is one of the most respectable women in England, and was most desperately fond of Lawless, who was an only son. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) never has recovered his (<font color='blue'><b>Lawless</b></font>) loss. Do you remember asking me who a tall elderly lady in mourning was, that you saw getting into her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) carriage one day, at South Audley-street chapel, as we passed by in our way to the park? That was Lady Lawless: I believe I didn't answer you at the time. I meet her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) every now and then -- to me a spectre of dismay. But, as Harriot Freke said, certainly such a man as poor Lawless was a useless being in society, however he (<font color='blue'><b>Lawless</b></font>) may be regretted by a doting mother. We should see things in a philosophical light, if we can. I should not have suffered half as much as I did if he (<font color='blue'><b>Lawless</b></font>) had been a man of a stronger understanding; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Lawless</b></font>) was a poor, vain, weak creature, that I actually drew on and duped with my own coquetry, whilst all the time I was endeavouring only to plague Lord Delacour. I was punished enough by the airs his (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) lordship doubly gave himself, upon the strength of his (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) valour and his (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) judgment -- they roused me completely; and I blamed him (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) with all my might, and got an enormous party of my friends, I mean my acquaintance, to run him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) down full cry, for having fought for me. It was absurd -- it was rash -- it was want of proper confidence in his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) wife; thus we said. Lord Delacour had his (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) partisans, it is true; amongst whom the loudest was odious Mrs Luttridge. I embraced the first opportunity I met with of retaliation. You must know that Mrs Luttridge, besides being a great faro-player, was a great dabbler in politics; for she (<font color='blue'><b>Luttridge</b></font>) was almost as fond of power as of money: she (<font color='blue'><b>Luttridge</b></font>) talked loud and fluently, and had, somehow or other, partly by intriguing, partly by relationship, connected herself with some of the leading men in parliament. There was to be a contested election in our county: Mr Luttridge had a good estate there next to Lord Delacour's, and being of an ancient family, and keeping a good table, the Luttridges were popular enough. At the first news of an election, out comes a flaming advertisement from Mr Luttridge; away posted Mrs Luttridge to begin her (<font color='blue'><b>Luttridge</b></font>) canvass, and away posted Lady Delacour after her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>), to canvass for a cousin of Harriot Freke. This was a new scene for me; but I piqued myself on the versatility of my talents, and I laid myself out to please all the squires, and, what was more difficult, all the squires' ladies, in *****shire. I was ambitious to have it said of me, ``that I was the finest figure that ever appeared upon a canvass.'' O, ye *****shireians, how hard did I work to obtain your praise! All that the combined force of vanity and hatred could inspire I performed, and with success. You have but little curiosity, I presume, to know how many hogsheads of port went down the throat of John Bull, or how many hecatombs were offered up to the genius of English liberty. My hatred of Mrs Luttridge was, of course, called love of my country. Lady Delacour was deified by all true patriots; and, luckily, a handsome legacy left me for my spirit, by an uncle who died six weeks before the election, enabled us to sustain the expense of my apotheosis. The day of election came; Harriot Freke and I made our appearance on the hustings, dressed in splendid party uniforms; and before us our knights and squires held two enormous panniers full of ribands and cockades, which we distributed with a grace that won all hearts, if not all votes. Mrs Luttridge thought the panniers would carry the election; and forthwith she (<font color='blue'><b>Luttridge</b></font>) sent off an express for a pair of panniers twice as large as ours. I took out my pencil, and drew a caricature of the ass and her (<font color='blue'><b>Luttridge</b></font>) panniers; wrote an epigram at the bottom of it; and the epigram and the caricature were soon in the hands of half *****shire. The verses were as bad as impromptus usually are, and the drawing was not much better than the writing; but the goodwill of the critics supplied all my deficiencies; and never was more praise bestowed upon the pen of Burke, or the pencil of Reynolds, than was lavished upon me by my honest friends. My dear Belinda, if you will not quarrel with the quality, you may have what quantity of praise you please. Mrs Luttridge, as I hoped and expected, was beyond measure enraged at the sight of the caricature and epigram. She (<font color='blue'><b>Luttridge</b></font>) was, besides being a gamester and a politician -- what do you think? -- an excellent shot! She (<font color='blue'><b>Luttridge</b></font>) wished, she (<font color='blue'><b>Luttridge</b></font>) said, to be a man, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Luttridge</b></font>) might be qualified to take proper notice of my conduct. The same kind friends who showed her (<font color='blue'><b>Luttridge</b></font>) my epigram repeated to me her (<font color='blue'><b>Luttridge</b></font>) observation upon it. Harriot Freke was at my elbow, and offered to take any message I might think proper to Mrs Luttridge. I scarcely thought her (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>) in earnest till she (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>) added, that the only way left now-a-days for a woman to distinguish herself was by spirit; as every thing else was grown ``cheap and vulgar in the eyes of men;'' that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>) knew one of the cleverest young men in England, and a man of fashion into the bargain, who was just going to publish a treatise <div class="bookquote">``upon the Propriety and Necessity of Female Duelling;''  (<font color='red'><b>men</b></font>)</div>and that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had demonstrated , beyond a possibility of doubt, that civilized society could not exist half a century longer without this necessary improvement. I had prodigious deference for the masculine superiority, as I thought it, of Harriot's understanding. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>) was a philosopher, and a fine lady -- I was only a fine lady; I had never fired a pistol in my life, and I was a little inclined to cowardice; but Harriot offered to bet any wager upon the steadiness of my hand, and assured me that I should charm all beholders in male attire. In short, as my second, if I would furnish her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) with proper credentials, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) swore she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) would undertake to furnish me with clothes, and pistols, and courage, and every thing I wanted. I sat down to pen my challenge. When I was writing it, my hand did not tremble much -- not more than my Lord Delacour's always does. The challenge was very prettily worded: I believe I can repeat it.

<p/>'<div class="bookquote">``Lady Delacour presents her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) compliments to Mrs Luttridge -- she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) is informed that Mrs L-- wishes she (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>) were a man, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>) might be qualified to take proper notice of Lady D--'s conduct. Lady Delacour begs leave to assure Mrs Luttridge, that though she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) has the misfortune to be a woman, she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) is willing to account for her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) conduct in any manner Mrs L-- may think proper, and at any hour and place she (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>) may appoint. Lady D-- leaves the choice of the weapons to Mrs L--. Mrs H. Freke, who has the honour of presenting this note, is Lady Delacour's friend upon this occasion.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``I cannot repeat Mrs Luttridge's answer; all I know is, it was not half as neatly worded as my note; but the essential part of it was, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Luttridge</b></font>) accepted my challenge with pleasure, and should do herself the honour of meeting me at six o'clock the next morning; that Miss Honour O``Grady would be her (<font color='blue'><b>Luttridge</b></font>) friend upon the occasion; and that pistols were the weapons she (<font color='blue'><b>Luttridge</b></font>) preferred. The place of appointment was behind an old barn, about two miles from the town of *****. The hour was fixed to be early in the morning, to prevent all probability of interruption. In the evening, Harriot and I rode to the ground. There were several bullets sticking in the posts of the barn: this was the place where Mrs Luttridge had been accustomed to exercise herself in firing at a mark. I own my courage <div class="bookquote">``oozed out''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>a little at this sight. The Duke de la Rochefoucault, I believe, said truly, that <div class="bookquote">``many would be cowards if they dared.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>There seemed to me to be no physical and less moral necessity for my fighting this duel; but I did not venture to reason on a point of honour with my spirited second. I bravadoed to Harriot most magnanimously; but at night, when Marriott was undressing me, I could not forbear giving her (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) a hint, which I thought might tend to preserve the king's peace, and the peace of the county. I went to the ground in the morning in good spirits, and with a safe conscience. Harriot was in admiration of my <div class="bookquote">``lion-port;''  (<font color='red'><b>Harriot/Harriot Freke/Freke</b></font>)</div>and, to do her (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) justice, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) conducted herself with great coolness upon the occasion; but then it may be observed, that it was I who was to stand fire, and not she (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>). I thought of poor Lawless a billion of times, at least, as we were going to the ground; and I had my presentiments, and my confused notions of poetic justice: but poetic justice, and all other sorts of justice, went clear out of my head, when I saw my antagonist and her (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) friend, actually pistol in hand, waiting for us; they were both in men's clothes. I secretly called upon the name of Marriott with fervency, and I looked round with more anxiety than ever Bluebeard's wife, or <div class="bookquote">``Anne, sister Anne!''  (<font color='red'><b>Bluebeard wife Anne Anne</b></font>)</div>looked to see if any body was coming: nothing was to be seen but the grass blown by the wind -- no Marriott to throw herself toute éplorée between the combatants -- no peace-officers to bind us over to our good behavior -- no deliverance at hand; and Mrs Luttridge, by all the laws of honour, as challenged, was to have the first shot. Oh, those laws of honour! I was upon the point of making an apology, in spite of them all, when, to my inexpressible joy, I was relieved from the dreadful alternative of being shot through the head, or of becoming a laughing-stock for life, by an incident, less heroic, I'll grant you, than opportune. But you shall have the whole scene, as well as I can recollect it; as well -- for those who for the first time go into a field of battle do not, as I am credibly informed and internally persuaded, always find the clearness of their memories improved by the novelty of their situation. Mrs Luttridge, when we came up, was leaning, with a truly martial negligence, against the wall of the barn, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Luttridge</b></font>) pistol, as I told you, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Luttridge</b></font>) hand. She (<font color='blue'><b>Luttridge</b></font>) spoke not a word; but her (<font color='blue'><b>Luttridge</b></font>) second, Miss Honour O``Grady, advanced towards us immediately, and, taking off her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) hat very manfully, addressed herself' to my second -- ``Mistress Harriot Freke, I presume, if I mistake not.'' Harriot bowed slightly, and answered, ``Miss Honour O<div class="bookquote">``Grady, I presume, if I mistake not.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``The same, at your service,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>replied Miss Honour. <div class="bookquote">``I have a few words to suggest that may save a great deal of noise, and bloodshed, and ill-will.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``As to noise,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harriot/Harriot Freke/Freke</b></font>)</div>said Harriot, ``it is a thing in which I delight, therefore I beg that mayn't be spared on my account; as to bloodshed, I beg that may not be spared on Lady Delacour's account, for her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) honour, I am sure, is dearer to her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) than her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) blood; and, as to ill-will, I should be concerned to have that saved on Mrs Luttridge's account, as we all know it is a thing in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Luttridge</b></font>) delights, even more than I do in noise, or Lady Delacour in blood: but pray proceed, Miss Honour O``Grady; you have a few words to suggest.'' ``Yes, I would willingly observe, as it is my duty to my principal,'' said Honour, ``that one who is compelled to fire her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) pistol with her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) left hand, though ever so good a shot naturally, is by no means on a footing with one who has the advantage of her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) right hand.'' Harriot rubbed my pistol with the sleeve of her (<font color='blue'><b>Luttridge</b></font>) coat, and I, recovering my wit with my hopes of being witty with impunity, answered, ``Unquestionably, left-handed wisdom and left-handed courage are neither of them the very best of their kinds; but we must content ourselves with them if we can have no other.'' ``That if'' cried Honour O``Grady, <div class="bookquote">``is not, like most of the family of the ifs, a peacemaker. My Lady Delacour, I was going to observe that my principal has met with an unfortunate accident, in the shape of a whitlow on the fore-finger of her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) right hand, which incapacitates her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) drawing a trigger; but I am at your service, ladies, either of you, that can't put up with a disappointment with good humour.''  (<font color='red'><b>Grady</b></font>)</div>I never, during the whole course of my existence, was more disposed to bear a disappointment with good humour, to prove that I was incapable bearing malice; and to oblige the seconds, for form's sake, I agreed that we should take our ground, and fire our pistols into the air. Mrs Luttridge, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Luttridge</b></font>) left-handed wisdom, fired first; and I, with great magnanimity, followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Luttridge</b></font>) example. I must do my adversary's second, Miss Honour O``Grady, the justice to observe, that in this whole affair she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) conducted herself not only with the spirit, but with the good-nature and generosity characteristic of her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) nation. We met enemies, and parted friends.

<p/>``Life is a tragicomedy! Though the critics will allow of no such thing in their books, it is a true representation of what passes in the world; and of all lives mine has been the most grotesque mixture, or alternation, I should say, of tragedy and comedy. All this is apropos to something I have not told you yet. This comic duel ended tragically for me. <div class="bookquote">``How?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>you say. Why, `tis clear that I was not shot through the head; but it would have been better, a hundred times better for me, if I had; I should have been spared, in this life at least the torments of the damned. I was not used to priming and loading: my pistol was overcharged: when I fired, it recoiled, and I received a blow on my breast, the consequences of which you have seen.

<p/>``The pain was nothing at the moment compared with what I have since experienced: but I will not complain till I cannot avoid it. I had not, at the time I received the blow, much leisure for lamentation; for I had scarcely discharged my pistol when we heard a loud shout on the other side of the barn, and a crowd of town's people, country people, and haymakers, came pouring down the lane towards us, with rakes and pitchforks in their hands. An English mob is really a formidable thing. Marriott had mismanaged her (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) business most strangely: she (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) had, indeed, spread a report of a duel -- a female duel; but the untutored sense of propriety amongst these rustics was so shocked at the idea of a duel fought by women in men's clothes, that I verily believe they would have thrown us into the river with all their hearts. Stupid blockheads! I am convinced that they would not have been half so much scandalized if we had boxed in petticoats. The want of these petticoats had nearly proved our destruction, or at least our disgrace: a peeress after being ducked, could never have held her (<font color='blue'><b>blockheads</b></font>) head above water again with any grace. The mob had just closed round us, crying, ``Shame! shame! shame! -- duck 'em -- duck 'em -- gentle or simple -- duck 'em -- duck 'em'' -- when their attention was suddenly turned towards a person who was driving up the lane a large herd of squeaking, grunting pigs. The person was clad in splendid regimentals, and he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) was armed with a long pole, to the end of which hung a bladder, and his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) pigs were frightened, and they ran squeaking from one side of the road to the other; and the pig-driver in regimentals, in the midst of the noise, could not without difficulty make his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) voice heard; but at last he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) was understood to say, that a bet of a hundred guineas depended upon his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) being able to keep these pigs ahead of a flock of turkeys that were following them; and he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) begged the mob to give him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) pigs fair play. At the news of this wager, and at the sight of the gentleman turned pig-driver, the mob were in raptures; and at the sound of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) voice, Harriot Freke immediately exclaimed, <div class="bookquote">``Clarence Hervey! by all that's lucky!'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Clarence Hervey!''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>interrupted Belinda. <div class="bookquote">``Clarence Hervey, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>said Lady Delacour, coolly: `he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) can do every thing, you know, even drive pigs, better than any body else! -- but let me go on.

<p/>``Harriot Freke shouted in a stentorian voice, which actually made your pig-driver start: she (<font color='blue'><b>blockheads</b></font>) explained to him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) in French our distress, and the cause of it. Clarence was, as I suppose you have discovered long ago, ``that cleverest young man in England who had written on the propriety and necessity of female duelling.'' He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) answered Harriot in French -- ``To attempt your rescue by force would be vain; but I will do better, I will make a diversion in your favour.'' Immediately, our hero, addressing himself to the sturdy fellow who held me in custody, exclaimed, <div class="bookquote">``Huzza, my boys! Old England for ever! Yonder comes a Frenchman with a flock of turkeys. My pigs will beat them, for a hundred guineas. Old England for ever, huzza!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``As he (<font color='blue'><b>Frenchman</b></font>) spoke, the French officer, with whom Clarence Hervey had laid the wager, appeared at the turn of the lane -- his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) turkeys half flying -- half hobbling up the road before him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>). The Frenchman waved a red streamer over the heads of his (<font color='blue'><b>Frenchman</b></font>) flock -- Clarence shook a pole, from the top of which hung a bladder full of beans. The pigs grunted, the turkeys gobbled, and the mob shouted: eager for the fame of Old England, the crowd followed Clarence with loud acclamations. The French officer was followed with groans and hisses. So great was the confusion, and so great the zeal of the patriots, that even the pleasure of ducking the female duellists was forgotten in the general enthusiasm. All eyes and all hearts were intent upon the race; and now the turkeys got foremost, and now the pigs. But when we came within sight of the horsepond, I heard one man cry, ``Don't forget the ducking.'' How I trembled! but our knight shouted to his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) followers -- <div class="bookquote">``for the love of Old England, my brave boys, keep between my pigs and the pond: -- if our pigs see the water, they'll run to it, and England's undone.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``The whole fury of the mob was by this speech conducted away from us. ``On, on, my boys, into town, to the market-place: whoever gains the market-place first wins the day.'' Our general shook the rattling bladder in triumph over the heads of <div class="bookquote">``the swinish multitude,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>and we followed in perfect security in his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) train into the town.

<p/>``Men, women, and children crowded to the windows and doors. <div class="bookquote">``Retreat into the first place you can,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>whispered Clarence to us: we were close to him (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>). Harriot Freke pushed her (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) way into a milliner's shop: I could not get in after her (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>), for a frightened pig turned back suddenly, and almost threw me down. Clarence Hervey caught me, and favoured my retreat into the shop. But poor Clarence lost his (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) bet by his (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) gallantry. Whilst he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) was manoeuvring in my favour, the turkeys got several yards ahead of the pigs, and reaching the market-place first, won the race.

<p/>``The French officer found great difficulty in getting safe out of the town; but Clarence represented to the mob that he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) was a prisoner on his (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) parole, and that it would be unlike Englishmen to insult a prisoner. So he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) got off without being pelted, and they both returned in safety to the house of General Y--, where they were to dine, and where they entertained a large party of officers with the account of this adventure.

<p/>``Mrs Freke and I rejoiced in our escape, and we thought that the whole business was now over; but in this we were mistaken. The news of our duel, which had spread in the town, raised such an uproar as had never been heard, even at the noisiest election. Would you believe it? -- The fate of the election turned upon this duel. The common people, one and all, declared that they would not vote either for Mr Luttridge or Mr Freke, because as how -- but I need not repeat all the platitudes that they said. In short, neither ribands nor brandy could bring them to reason. With true English pigheadedness, they went every man of them and polled for an independent candidate of their own choosing, whose wife, forsooth, was a proper behaved woman.

<p/>``The only thing I had to console me for all this was Clarence Hervey's opinion that I looked better in man's clothes than my friend Harriot Freke. Clarence was charmed with my spirit and grace; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) had not leisure at that time to attach himself seriously to me, or to any thing. He (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) was then about nineteen or twenty: he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) was all vivacity, presumption, and paradox; he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) was enthusiastic in support of his (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) opinions; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) was at the same time the most candid man in the world, for there was no set of tenets which could be called exclusively his (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>): he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) adopted in liberal rotation every possible absurdity; and, to do him (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) justice, defended each in its turn with the most ingenious arguments that could be devised, and with a flow of words which charmed the ear, if not the sense. His (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) essay on female duelling was a most extraordinary performance; it was handed about in manuscript till it was worn out; he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) talked of publishing it, and dedicating it to me. However, this scheme, amongst a million of others, he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) talked of, but never put into execution. Luckily for him (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>), many of his (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) frolics evaporated in words. I saw but little either of him (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) or his (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) follies at this time. All I know about him (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) is, that after he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) had lost his (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) bet of a hundred guineas, as a pig-driver, by his (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) knight-errantry in rescuing the female duellists from a mob, he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) wrote a very charming copy of verses upon the occasion; and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) was so much provoked by the stupidity of some of his (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) brother officers who could not understand the verses, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) took a disgust to the army, and sold his (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) commission. He (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) set out upon a tour to the continent, and I returned with Harriot Freke to London, and forgot the existence of such a person as Clarence Hervey for three or four years. Unless people can be of some use, or unless they are actually present, let them be ever so agreeable or meritorious, we are very apt to forget them. One grows strangely selfish by living in the world: `tis a perfect cure for romantic notions of gratitude, and love, and so forth. If I had lived in the country in an old manor-house, Clarence Hervey would have doubtless reigned paramount in my imagination as the deliverer of my life, &c. But in London one has no time for thinking of deliverers. And yet what I did with my time I cannot tell you: `tis gone, and no trace left. One day after another went I know not how. Had I wept for every day I lost, I'm sure I should have cried my eyes out before this time. If I had enjoyed any amusement in the midst of this dissipation, it would all have been very well; but I declare to you in confidence I have been tired to death. Nothing can be more monotonous than the life of a hackneyed fine lady; -- I question whether a dray-horse, or a horse in a mill, would willingly exchange places with one, if they could know as much of the matter as I do. You are surprised at hearing all this from me. My dear Belinda, how I envy you! You are not yet tired of every thing. The world has still the gloss of novelty for you; but don't expect that can last above a season. My first winter was certainly entertaining enough. One begins with being charmed with the bustle and glare, and what the French call spectacle; this is over, I think, in six months. I can but just recollect having been amused at the Theatres, and the Opera, and the Pantheon, and Ranelagh, and all those places, for their own sakes. Soon, very soon, we go out to see people, not things: then we grow tired of seeing people; then we grow tired of being seen by people; and then we go out merely because we can't stay at home. A dismal story and a true one. Excuse me for showing you the simple truth; well-dressed falsehood is a personage much more presentable. I am now come to an epoch in my history in which there is a dearth of extraordinary, events. What shall I do? Shall I invent? I would if I could; but I cannot. Then I must confess to you that during these last four years I should have died of ennui if I had not been kept alive by my hatred of Mrs Luttridge and of my husband. I don't know which I hate most -- O, yes, I do -- I certainly hate Mrs Luttridge the most; for a woman can always hate a woman more than she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) can hate a man, unless she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) has been in love with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), which I never was with poor Lord Delacour. Yes! I certainly hate Mrs Luttridge the most; I cannot count the number of extravagant things I have done on purpose to eclipse her (<font color='blue'><b>Luttridge</b></font>). We have had rival routs, rival concerts, rival galas, rival theatres: she (<font color='blue'><b>Luttridge</b></font>) has cost me more than she (<font color='blue'><b>Luttridge</b></font>)'s worth; but then I certainly have mortified her (<font color='blue'><b>Luttridge</b></font>) once a month at least. My hatred to Mrs Luttridge, my dear, is the remote cause of my love for you; for it was the cause of my intimacy with your aunt Stanhope. -- Mrs Stanhope is really a clever woman -- she (<font color='blue'><b>Stanhope</b></font>) knows how to turn the hatred of all her (<font color='blue'><b>Stanhope</b></font>) friends and acquaintance to her (<font color='blue'><b>Stanhope</b></font>) own advantage. -- To serve lovers is a thankless office compared with that of serving haters -- polite haters I mean. It may be dangerous, for aught I know, to interpose in the quarrels of those who hate their neighbours, not only with all their souls, but with all their strength -- the barbarians fight it out, kiss, and are friends. The quarrels which never come to blows are safer for a go-between; but even these are not to be compared to such as never come to words: your true silent hatred is that which lasts for ever. The moment it was known that Mrs Luttridge and I had come to the resolution never to speak to one another, your aunt Stanhope began to minister to my hatred so, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Stanhope</b></font>) made herself quite agreeable. She (<font color='blue'><b>Stanhope</b></font>) one winter gave me notice that my adversary had set her (<font color='blue'><b>Stanhope</b></font>) heart upon having a magnificent entertainment on a particular day. On that day I determined, of course, to have a rival gala. Mrs Stanhope's maid had a lover, a gardener, who lived at Chelsea; and the gardener had an aloe, which was expected soon to blow. Now a plant that blows but once in a hundred years is worth having. The gardener intended to make a public exhibition of it, by which he (<font color='blue'><b>gardener</b></font>) expected to gain about a hundred guineas. Your aunt Stanhope's maid got it from him (<font color='blue'><b>gardener</b></font>) for me for fifty; and I had it whispered about that an aloe in full blow would stand in the middle of one of Lady Delacour's supper tables. The difficulty was to make Mrs Luttridge fix upon the very day we wanted; for you know we could not possibly put off the blowing of our aloe. Your aunt Stanhope managed the thing admirably by means of a common friend, who was not a suspected person with the Luttridges; in short, my dear, I gained my point -- every body came from Mrs Luttridge's to me, or to my aloe. She (<font color='blue'><b>Luttridge</b></font>) had a prodigiously fine supper, but scarcely a soul stayed with her (<font color='blue'><b>Luttridge</b></font>); they all came to see what could be seen but once in a hundred years. Now the aloe, you know, is of a cumbersome height for a supper ornament. My saloon luckily has a dome, and under the dome we placed it. Round the huge china vase in which it was planted we placed the most beautiful, or rather the most expensive hothouse plants we could procure. After all, the aloe was an ugly thing; but it answered my purpose -- it made Mrs Luttridge, as I am credibly informed, absolutely weep with vexation. I was excessively obliged to your aunt Stanhope; and I assured her (<font color='blue'><b>Stanhope</b></font>) that if ever it were in my power, she (<font color='blue'><b>Stanhope</b></font>) might depend upon my gratitude. Pray, when you write, repeat the same thing to her (<font color='blue'><b>Stanhope</b></font>), and tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Stanhope</b></font>) that since she (<font color='blue'><b>Stanhope</b></font>) has introduced Belinda Portman to me, I am a hundred times more obliged to her (<font color='blue'><b>Stanhope</b></font>) than ever I was before.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But to proceed with my important history -- I will not tire you with fighting over again all my battles in my seven years' war with Mrs Luttridge. I believe love is more to your taste than hatred; therefore I will go on as fast as possible to Clarence Hervey's return from his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) travels. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) was much improved by them, or at least I thought so; for he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) was heard to declare, that after all he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) had seen in France and Italy, Lady Delacour appeared to him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) the most charming woman, of her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) age, in Europe. The words, of her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) age, piqued me; and I spared no pains to make him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) forget them. A stupid man cannot readily be persuaded out of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) senses -- what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sees he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sees, and neither more nor less; but `tis the easiest thing in the world to catch hold of a man of genius: you have nothing to do but to appeal from his (<font color='blue'><b>genius</b></font>) senses to his (<font color='blue'><b>genius</b></font>) imagination, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>genius</b></font>) sees with the eyes of his (<font color='blue'><b>genius</b></font>) imagination, and hears with the ears of his (<font color='blue'><b>genius</b></font>) imagination; and then no matter what the age, beauty, or wit of the charmer may be -- no matter whether it be Lady Delacour or Belinda Portman. I think I know Clarence Hervey's character au fin fond, and I could lead him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) where I pleased: but don't be alarmed, my dear; you know I can't lead him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) into matrimony. You look at me, and from me, and you don't well know which way to look. You are surprised, perhaps, after all that passed, all that I felt, and all that I still feel about poor Lawless, I should not be cured of coquetry. So am I surprised; but habit, fashion, the devil, I believe, lead us on: and then, Lord Delacour is so obstinate and jealous -- you can't have forgotten the polite conversation that passed one morning at breakfast between his (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) lordship and me about Clarence Hervey; but neither does his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) lordship know, nor does Clarence Hervey suspect, that my object with him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) is to conceal from the world what I cannot conceal from myself -- that I am a dying woman. I am, and I see you think me, a strange, weak, inconsistent creature. I was intended for something better, but now it is too late; a coquette I have lived, and a coquette I shall die: I speak frankly to you. Let me have the glory of leading Clarence Hervey about with me in public for a few months longer, then I must quit the stage. As to love, you know with me that is out of the question; all I ask or wish for is admiration.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div><p/>Lady Delacour paused, and leaned back on the sofa; she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) appeared in great pain.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! -- I am sometimes,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>resumed she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>), `as you see, in terrible pain. For two years after I gave myself that blow with the pistol, I neglected the warning twinges that I felt from time to time; at last I was terrified. Marriott was the only person to whom I mentioned my fears, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) was profoundly ignorant: she (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) flattered me with false hopes, till, alas! it was in vain to doubt of the nature of my complaint: then she (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) urged me to consult a physician: that I would not do -- I could not -- I never will consult a physician, -- I would not for the universe have my situation known. You stare -- you cannot enter into my feelings. Why, my dear, if I lose admiration, what have I left? Would you have me live upon pity? Consider what a dreadful thing it must be to me, who have no friends, no family, to be confined to a sick room -- a sick bed; `tis what I must come to at last, but not yet -- not yet. I have fortitude; I should despise myself if I had no species of merit; besides, it is still some occupation to me to act my part in public; and bustle, noise, nonsense, if they do not amuse or interest me, yet they stifle reflection. May you never know what it is to feel remorse! The idea of that poor wretch, Lawless, whom I actually murdered as much as if I had shot him (<font color='blue'><b>Lawless</b></font>), haunts me whenever I am alone. It is now between eight and nine years since he (<font color='blue'><b>Lawless</b></font>) died, and I have lived ever since in a constant course of dissipation; but it won't do -- conscience, conscience will be heard! Since my health has been weakened, I believe I have acquired more conscience. I really think that my stupid lord, who has neither ideas nor sensations, except when he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) is intoxicated, is a hundred times happier than I am. But I will spare you, Belinda; I promised that you should not have a scene, and I will keep my word. It is, however, a great relief to open my mind to one who has some feeling: Harriot Freke has none; I am convinced that she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) has no more feeling than this table. I have not yet told you how she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) has used me. You know that it was she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) who led or rather dragged me into that scrape with Lawless; for that I never reproached her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>). You know it was she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) who frightened me into fighting that duel with Mrs Luttridge; for this I never reproached her (<font color='blue'><b>Luttridge</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Luttridge</b></font>) has cost me my peace of mind, my health, my life; she (<font color='blue'><b>Luttridge</b></font>) knows it, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Luttridge</b></font>) forsakes, betrays, insults, and leaves me to die. I cannot command my temper sufficiently to be coherent when I speak of her (<font color='blue'><b>Luttridge</b></font>); I cannot express in words what I feel. How could that most treacherous of beings, for ten years, make me believe that she (<font color='blue'><b>Luttridge</b></font>) was my friend? Whilst I thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Luttridge</b></font>) really loved me, I pardoned her (<font color='blue'><b>Luttridge</b></font>) all her (<font color='blue'><b>Luttridge</b></font>) faults -- all -- what a comprehensive word! -- All, all I forgave; and continually said -- <div class="bookquote">``but she (<font color='blue'><b>coquette</b></font>) has a good heart.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>A good heart! -- she (<font color='blue'><b>Luttridge</b></font>) has no heart! -- she (<font color='blue'><b>Luttridge</b></font>) has no feeling for any living creature but herself. I always thought that she (<font color='blue'><b>Luttridge</b></font>) cared for no one but for me; but now I find she (<font color='blue'><b>Luttridge</b></font>) can throw me off as easily as she (<font color='blue'><b>Luttridge</b></font>) would her (<font color='blue'><b>Luttridge</b></font>) glove. And this, too, I suppose she (<font color='blue'><b>Luttridge</b></font>) calls a frolic; or, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Luttridge</b></font>) own vulgar language, fun. Can you believe it? -- What do you think she (<font color='blue'><b>Luttridge</b></font>) has done my dear? She (<font color='blue'><b>Luttridge</b></font>) has gone over at last to odious Mrs Luttridge -- actually she (<font color='blue'><b>Luttridge</b></font>) has gone down with the Luttridges to *****shire. The independent member having taken the Chiltern Hundreds, vacates his (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) seat: a new election comes on directly: the Luttridgcs are to bring in Freke -- not Harriot's cousin -- they have cut him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>), -- but her (<font color='blue'><b>Luttridge</b></font>) husband, who is now to commence senator: he (<font color='blue'><b>senator</b></font>) is to come in for the county, upon condition that Luttridge shall have Freke's borough. Lord Delacour, without saying one syllable, has promised his (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) interest to this precious junto, and Lady Delacour is left a miserable cipher. My lord's motives I can clearly understand: he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) lost a thousand guineas to Mrs Luttridge this winter, and this is a convenient way of paying her (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>). Why Harriot should be so anxious to serve a husband whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>) hates, bitterly hates, might surprise any body who did not know les dessous des cartes as well as I do. You are but just come into the world, Belinda -- the world of wickedness, I mean, my dear, or you would have heard what a piece of work there was a few years ago about Harriot Freke and this cousin of hers. Without betraying her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) confidence, I may just tell you what is known to every body, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) went so far, that if it had not been for me, not a soul would have visited her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>): she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) swam in the sea of folly out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) depth -- the tide of fashion ebbed, and there was she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) left sticking knee deep in the mud -- a ridiculous, scandalous figure. I had the courage and foolish good-nature to hazard myself for her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>), and actually dragged her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) to terra firma: -- how she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) has gone on since I cannot tell you precisely, because I am in the secret; but the catastrophe is public: to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) peace with her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) husband, she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) gives up her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) friend. Well, that I could have pardoned, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) had not been so base as to go over to Mrs Luttridge. Mrs Luttridge offered -LRB-I've seen the letter, and Harriot's answer-RRB- to bring in Freke, the husband, and to make both a county and a family peace, on condition that Harriot should give up all connexion with Lady Delacour. Mrs Luttridge knew this would provoke me beyond measure, and there is nothing she (<font color='blue'><b>Luttridge</b></font>) would not do to gratify her (<font color='blue'><b>Luttridge</b></font>) mean, malevolent passions. She (<font color='blue'><b>Luttridge</b></font>) has succeeded for once in her (<font color='blue'><b>Luttridge</b></font>) life. The blame of the duel, of course, is all thrown upon me. And -LRB-would you believe it?-RRB- Harriot Freke, I am credibly informed, throws all the blame of Lawless's business on me; nay, hints that Lawless's deathbed declaration of my innocence was very generous. Oh, the treachery, the baseness of this woman! And it was my fate to hear all this last night at the masquerade. I waited, and waited, and looked every where for Harriot -- she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was to be the widow Brady, I knew: at last the widow Brady made her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) appearance, and I accosted her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) with all my usual familiarity. The widow was dumb. I insisted upon knowing the cause of this sudden loss of speech. The widow took me into another apartment, unmasked, and there I beheld Mr Freke, the husband. I was astonished -- had no idea of the truth. <div class="bookquote">``Where is Harriot?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I believe, were the first words I said. <div class="bookquote">``Gone to the county.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``To the county!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes; to *****shire, with Mrs Luttridge.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Luttridge/Luttridge</b></font>)</div>-- Mrs Luttridge -- odious Mrs Luttridge! I could scarcely believe my senses. But Freke, who always hated me, believing that I led his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) wife, instead of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) leading me into mischief; would have enjoyed my astonishment and my rage; so I concealed both, with all possible presence of mind. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) went on overwhelming me with explanations and copies of letters; and declared it was at Mrs Freke's request he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) did and said all this, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was to follow her (<font color='blue'><b>Freke</b></font>) early the next morning to *****shire. I broke from him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), simply wishing him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) a good journey, and as much family peace as his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) patience merited. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) knows that I know his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) wife's history, and though she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) has no shame, he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) has some. I had the satisfaction to leave him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) blushing with anger, and I supported the character of the comic muse a full hour afterwards, to convince him (<font color='blue'><b>muse</b></font>) that all their combined malice would fail to break my spirit in public: what I suffer in private is known only to my own heart.''

<p/>As she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) finished these words, Lady Delacour rose abruptly, and hummed a new opera air. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) retired to her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) boudoir, saying, with an air of levity, to Belinda as she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) left the room,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good bye, my dear Belinda; I leave you to ruminate sweet and bitter thoughts; to think of the last speech and confession of Lady Delacour, or what will interest you much more, the first speech and confession of -- Clarence Hervey.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER V

<p/>Birthday Dresses

<p/>LADY DELACOUR``S history, and the manner in which it was related, excited in Belinda's mind astonishment, pity, admiration, and contempt: astonishment at her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) inconsistency, pity for her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) misfortunes, admiration for her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) talents, and contempt for her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) conduct. To these emotions succeeded the recollection of the promise which she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) had made, not to leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) last illness at the mercy of an insolent attendant. This promise Belinda thought of with terror: she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) dreaded the sight of sufferings which she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) knew must end in death: she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) dreaded the sight of that affected gaiety and of that real levity which so ill became the condition of a dying woman. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) trembled at the idea of being under the guidance of one who was so little able to conduct herself: and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) could not help blaming her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) aunt Stanhope severely for placing her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) in such a perilous situation. It was obvious that some of Lady Delacour's history must have been known to Mrs Stanhope; and Belinda, the more she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) reflected, was the more surprised at her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) aunt's having chosen such a chaperon for a young woman just entering into the world. When the understanding is suddenly roused and forced to exert itself, what a multitude of deductions it makes in a short time! Belinda saw things in a new light; and for the first time in her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) life she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) reasoned for herself upon what she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) saw and felt. It is sometimes safer for young people to see than to hear of certain characters. At a distance, Lady Delacour had appeared to Miss Portman the happiest person in the world; upon a nearer view, she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) discovered that her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) ladyship was one of the most miserable of human beings. To have married her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) niece to such a man as Lord Delacour, Mrs Stanhope would have thought the most fortunate thing imaginable; but it was now obvious to Belinda, that neither the title of viscountess, nor the pleasure of spending three fortunes, could ensure felicity. Lady Delacour confessed, that in the midst of the utmost luxury and dissipation she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) had been a constant prey to ennui; that the want of domestic happiness could never be supplied by that public admiration of which she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) was so ambitious; and that the immoderate indulgence of her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) vanity had led her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>), by inevitable steps, into follies and imprudences which had ruined her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) health, and destroyed her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) peace of mind. ``If Lady Delacour, with all the advantages of wealth, rank, wit, and beauty, has not been able to make herself happy in this life of fashionable dissipation,<div class="bookquote">'' said Belinda to herself, `why should I follow the same course, and expect to be more fortunate?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div><p/>It is singular, that the very means which Mrs Stanhope had taken to make a fine lady of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) niece tended to produce an effect diametrically opposite to what might have been expected. The result of Belinda's reflections upon Lady Delacour's history was a resolution to benefit by her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) bad example; but this resolution it was more easy to form than to keep. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) ladyship, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) wished to please or to govern, had fascinating manners, and could alternately use the sarcastic powers of wit, and the fond tone of persuasion, to accomplish her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) purposes. It was Belinda's intention, in pursuance of her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) new plans of life, to spend, whilst she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) remained in London, as little money as possible upon superfluities and dress. She (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) had, at her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) own disposal, only 100l. per annum, the interest of her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) fortune; but besides this, her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) aunt, who was desirous that she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) should go to court, and make a splendid figure there, had sent her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) a draught on her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) banker for two hundred guineas. <div class="bookquote">``You will, I trust,''  (<font color='red'><b>aunt</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) aunt, at the conclusion of the letter, `repay me when you are established in the world; as I hope and believe, from what I hear from Lady Delacour of the power of your charms, you will soon be, to the entire satisfaction of all your friends. Pray do not neglect to mention my friend Clarence Hervey particularly when you write next. I understand from one who is well acquainted with him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>), and who has actually seen his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) rent-roll, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) has a clear 10,000 l. a year.''

<p/>Belinda resolved neither to go to court, nor to touch her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) aunt's two hundred guineas; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) wrote a long letter to her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>), in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) explained her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) feelings and views at large. In this letter she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) meant to have returned Mrs Stanhope's draught, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) feelings and views changed between the writing of this epistle and the going out of the post. Mrs Franks, the milliner, came in the interim, and brought home Lady Delacour's beautiful dress: it was not the sight of this, however, which changed Belinda's mind; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) could not resist Lady Delacour's raillery.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>ladyship</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) ladyship, after having listened to all Miss Portman could say about her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) love of independence, and the necessity of economy to preserve that independence, `all this is prodigiously fine -- but shall I translate into plain English? You were mortally wounded the other night by some random reflections of a set of foolish young men -- Clarence Hervey amongst the number; and instead of punishing them, you sagely and generously determined to punish yourself. Then, to convince this youth that you have not a thought of those odious nets and cages, that you have no design whatever upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) heart, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) has no manner of influence on yours, you very judiciously determine, at the first hint from him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>), to change your dress, your manners, and your character, and thus to say to him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>), in as plain terms as possible -- <div class="bookquote">``You see, sir, a word to the wise is enough; I understand you disapprove of showy dress and coquetry, and therefore, as I dressed and coquetted only to please you, now I shall lay aside dress and coquetry, since I find that they are not to your taste -- and I hope, sir, you like my simplicity!''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Depend upon it, my dear, Clarence Hervey understands simplicity as well as you or I do. All this would be vastly well, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) did not know that you overheard that conversation; but as he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) does know it, trust me, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) will attribute any sudden change in your manners and appearance, right or wrong, to the motives I have mentioned. So don't, novice as you are! set about to manoeuvre for yourself. Leave all that to your aunt Stanhope, or to me, and then you know your conscience will be all the time as white as your hands, -- which, by-the-bye, Clarence Hervey, the other day, said were the whitest hands he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) had ever seen. Perhaps all this time you have taken it into your head that full dress will not become you; but I assure you that it will -- you look well in any thing --

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But from the hoop's bewitching round,
The very shoe has power to wound.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>So come down to Mrs Franks, and order your birthnight dress like a reasonable creature.''
Like a reasonable creature, Miss Portman followed Lady Delacour, and bespoke, or rather let her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) ladyship bespeak for her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>), fifty guineas' worth of elegance and fashion. ``You must go to the drawing-room with me next week, and be presented,<div class="bookquote">'' said Lady Delacour, `and then, as it is the first time, you must be elegantly dressed, and you must not wear the same dress on the birthnight. So, Mrs Franks, let this be finished first, as fast as you can, and by that time, perhaps, we shall think of something superlatively charming for the night of nights.''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs Franks departed, and Belinda sighed. <div class="bookquote">``A silver penny for your thoughts!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>cried Lady Delacour. ``You are thinking that you are like Camilla, and I like Mrs Mitten. Novel reading -- as I dare say you have been told by your governess, as I was told by mine, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>) by hers, I suppose -- novel reading for young ladies is the most dangerous --

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Clarence Hervey, I protest!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>said Lady Delacour, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) at this instant entered the room. <div class="bookquote">``Do pray, Clarence, help me out, for the sake of this young lady, with a moral sentence against novel reading: but that might go against your conscience, or your interest; so we'll spare you. How I regret that we had not the charming serpent at the masquerade the other night!''

 (<font color='red'><b>ladyship</b></font>)</div><p/>The moment her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) ladyship mentioned the masquerade, the conversation which had passed at Lady Singleton's came full into Clarence Hervey's recollection, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) embarrassment was evident -- not indeed to Belinda, who had turned away to look over some new music that lay upon a stand at the farthest end of the room; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) found this such a wonderfully interesting occupation, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) did not for some minutes hear, or appear to hear, one word of the conversation which was going on between Mr Hervey and Lady Delacour. At last, her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) ladyship tapped her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) upon the shoulder, saying, in a playful tone, ``Miss Portman, I arrest your attention at the suit of Clarence Hervey: this gentleman is passionately fond of music -- to my curse -- for he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) never sees my harp but he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) worries me with reproaches for having left off playing upon it. Now he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) has just given me his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) word that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) will not reproach me again for a month to come if you will favour us with one air. I assure you, Clarence, that Belinda touches a harp divinely -- she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) would absolutely charm -- ' ``Your ladyship should not waste such valuable praise,'' interrupted Belinda. <div class="bookquote">``Do you forget that Belinda Portman and her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) accomplishments have already been as well advertised as Packwood's razor-strops?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div><p/>The manner in which these words were pronounced made a great impression upon Clarence Hervey, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) began to believe it was possible that a niece of the match-making Mrs Stanhope might not be 'a compound of art and affectation.'' ``Though her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) aunt has advertised her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>),<div class="bookquote">'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) to himself, `she (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>) seems to have too much dignity to advertise herself, and it would be very unjust to blame her (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>) for the faults of another person. I will see more of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>Some morning visitors were announced, who for the time suspended Clarence Hervey's reflections: the effect of them, however, immediately appeared; for as his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) good opinion of Belinda increased, his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) ambition to please her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) was strongly excited. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) displayed all his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) powers of wit and humour; and not only Lady Delacour but every body present observed, `that Mr Hervey, who was always the most entertaining man in the world, this morning surpassed himself and was absolutely the most entertaining man in the universe.'' He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was mortified, notwithstanding; for he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) distinctly perceived, that whilst Belinda joined with ease and dignity in the general conversation, her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) manner towards him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was grave and reserved. The next morning he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) called earlier than usual; but though Lady Delacour was always at home to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) was then unluckily dressing to go to court: he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) inquired whether Miss Portman would accompany her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) ladyship, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) learnt from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) friend Marriott that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) was not to be presented this day, because Mrs Franks had not brought home her (<font color='blue'><b>Franks</b></font>) dress. Mr Hervey called again two hours afterwards. -- Lady Delacour was gone to court. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) asked for Miss Portman. <div class="bookquote">``Not at home,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was the mortifying answer; though, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) had passed by the windows, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) had heard the delightful sound of her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) harp. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) walked up and down in the square impatiently, till he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) saw Lady Delacour's carriage appear.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The drawing-room has lasted an unconscionable time this morning,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>), as he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) handed her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) ladyship out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) coach. <div class="bookquote">``Am not I the most virtuous of virtuous women,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>said Lady Delacour, `to go to court such a day as this? But,<div class="bookquote">'' whispered she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>), as she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) went up stairs, `like all other amazingly good people, I have amazingly good reasons for being good. The queen is soon to give a charming breakfast at Frogmore, and I am paying my court with all my might, in hopes of being asked; for Belinda must see one of their galas before we leave town, that I'm determined upon. -- But where is she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Not at home,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div>said Clarence, smiling. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, not at home is nonsense, you know. Shine out, appear, be found, my lovely Zara!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>cried Lady Delacour, opening the library door. ``Here she (<font color='blue'><b>Zara</b></font>) is -- what doing I know not -- studying Hervey's Meditations on the Tombs, I should guess, by the sanctification of her (<font color='blue'><b>Zara</b></font>) looks. If you be not totally above all sublunary considerations, admire my lilies of the valley, and let me give you a lecture, not upon heads, or upon hearts, but on what is of much more consequence, upon hoops. Every body wears hoops, but how few -- `tis a melancholy consideration -- how very few can manage them! There's my friend Lady C--; in an elegant undress she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) passes for very genteel, but put her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) into a hoop and she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) looks as pitiable a figure, as much a prisoner, and as little able to walk, as a child in a go-cart. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) gets on, I grant you, and so does the poor child; but, getting on, you know, is not walking. Oh, Clarence, I wish you had seen the two Lady R.<div class="bookquote">``s sticking close to one another, their father pushing them on together, like two decanters in a bottle-coaster, with such magnificent diamond labels round their necks!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div><p/>Encouraged by Clarence Hervey's laughter, Lady Delacour went on to mimic what she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) called the hoop awkwardness of all her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) acquaintance; and if these could have failed to divert Belinda, it was impossible for her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) to be serious when she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) heard Clarence Hervey declare that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) was convinced he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) could manage a hoop as well as any woman in England, except Lady Delacour.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now here,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>), `is the purblind dowager, Lady Boucher, just at the door, Lady Delacour; she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) would not know my face, she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) would not see my beard, and I will bet fifty guineas that I come into a room in a hoop, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) does not find me out by my air -- that I do not betray myself, in short, by my masculine awkwardness.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hold you to your word, Clarence,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>cried Lady Delacour.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They have let the purblind dowager in; I hear her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) on the stairs. Here -- through this way you can go: as you do every thing quicker than any body else in the world, you will certainly be full dressed in a quarter of an hour; I'll engage to keep the dowager in scandal for that time. Go! Marriott has old hoops and old finery of mine, and you have all-powerful influence, I know, with Marriott: so go and use it, and let us see you in all your glory -- though I vow I tremble for my fifty guineas.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div><p/>Lady Delacour kept the dowager in scandal, according to her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) engagement, for a good quarter of an hour; then the dresses at the drawing-room took up another quarter; and, at last, the dowager began to give an account of sundry wonderful cures that had been performed, to her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) certain knowledge, by her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) favourite concentrated extract or anima of quassia. She (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) entered into the history of the negro slave named Quassi, who discovered this medical wood, which he (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) kept a close secret till Mr Daghlberg, a magistrate of Surinam, wormed it out of him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr</b></font>), brought a branch of the tree to Europe, and communicated it to the great Linnæus -- when Clarence Hervey was announced by the title of <div class="bookquote">``The Countess de Pomenars.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``An émigrée -- a charming woman!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>whispered Lady Delacour; `she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) was to have been at the drawing-room to-day but for a blunder of mine: ready dressed she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) was, and I didn't call for her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>)! Ah, Mad de Pomenars, I am actually ashamed to see you,'' continued her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) ladyship; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) went forward to meet Clarence Hervey, who really made his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) entrée with very composed assurance and grace. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) managed his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) hoop with such skill and dexterity, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) well deserved the praise of being a universal genius. The Countess de Pomenars spoke French and broken English incomparably well, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) made out that she (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) was descended from the Pomenars of the time of Mad de Sevigné: she (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) said that she (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) had in her (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) possession several original letters of Mad de Sevigné, and a lock of Mad de Grignan's fine hair.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have sometimes fancied, but I believe it is only my fancy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>said Lady Delacour, `that this young lady,<div class="bookquote">'' turning to Belinda, `is not unlike your Mad de Grignan. I have seen a picture of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) at Strawberry-hill.''

 (<font color='red'><b>this lady</b></font>)</div><p/>Mad de Pomenars acknowledged that there was a resemblance, but added, that it was flattery in the extreme to Mad de Grignan to say so.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It would be a sin, undoubtedly, to waste flattery upon the dead, my dear countess,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>said Lady Delacour; `but here, without flattery to the living, as you have a lock of Mad de Grignan's hair, you can tell us whether la belle chevelure, of which Mad de Sevigné talked so much, was any thing to be compared to my Belinda<div class="bookquote">``s.''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>As she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) spoke, Lady Delacour, before Belinda was aware of her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) intentions, dexterously let down her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) beautiful tresses; and the Countess de Pomenars was so much struck at the sight, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) was incapable of paying the necessary compliments. <div class="bookquote">``Nay, touch it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>said Lady Delacour -- `it is so fine and so soft.''

<p/>At this dangerous moment her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) ladyship artfully let drop the comb. Clarence Hervey suddenly stooped to pick it up, totally forgetting his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) hoop and his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) character. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) threw down the music-stand with his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) hoop. Lady Delacour exclaimed <div class="bookquote">``Bravissima!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>and burst out a-laughing. Lady Boucher, in amazement, looked from one to another for an explanation, and was a considerable time before, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Boucher</b></font>) said, she (<font color='blue'><b>Boucher</b></font>) could believe her (<font color='blue'><b>Boucher</b></font>) own eyes. Clarence Hervey acknowledged he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) had lost his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) bet, joined in the laugh, and declared that fifty guineas was too little to pay for the sight of the finest hair that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) had ever beheld. <div class="bookquote">``I declare he (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) deserves a lock of la belle chevelure for that speech, Miss Portman,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>cried Lady Delacour; <div class="bookquote">``I'll appeal to all the world -- Mad de Pomenars must have a lock to measure with Mad de Grignan's? Come, a second rape of the lock, Belinda.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div><p/>Fortunately for Belinda, `the glittering forfex' was not immediately produced, as fine ladies do not now, as in former times, carry any such useless implements about with them.

<p/>Such was the modest, graceful dignity of Miss Portman's manners, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) escaped without even the charge of prudery. She (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) retired to her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) own apartment as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) could.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) passes on in unblenched majesty,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>said Lady Delacour.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) is really a charming woman,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div>said Clarence Hervey, in a low voice, to Lady Delacour, drawing her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) into a recessed window: he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) in the same low voice continued, ``Could I obtain a private audience of a few minutes when your ladyship is at leisure? -- I have -- ' ``I am never at leisure,<div class="bookquote">'' interrupted Lady Delacour; `but if you have any thing particular to say to me -- as I guess you have, by my skill in human nature -- come here to my concert to-night, before the rest of the world. Wait patiently in the music-room and perhaps I may grant you a private audience, as you had the grace not to call it a tête-à-tête. In the mean time, my dear Countess de Pomenars, had we not better take off our hoops?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>In the evening, Clarence Hervey was in the music-room a considerable time before Lady Delacour appeared: how patiently he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) waited is not known to any one but himself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have not I given you time to compose a charming speech?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>said Lady Delacour as she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) entered the room; `but make it as short as you can, unless you wish that Miss Portman should hear it, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) will be down stairs in three minutes.''

<p/>``In one word, then, my dear Lady Delacour, can you, and will you, make my peace with Miss Portman? -- I am much concerned about that foolish razor-strop dialogue which she (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) overheard at Lady Singleton<div class="bookquote">``s.''

I am convinced that, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) is a niece of Mrs Stanhope's, she (<font color='blue'><b>Stanhope</b></font>) has dignity of mind and simplicity of character. Will you, my dear Lady Delacour, tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) so?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Stay,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>interrupted Lady Delacour; `let me get it by heart. I should have made a terrible bad messenger of the gods and goddesses, for I never in my life could, like Iris, repeat a message in the same words in which it was delivered to me.

<div class="bookquote">``Then you are not in jest, but in downright sober earnest? -- Ha!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>said Lady Delacour, with an arch look, <div class="bookquote">``I did not know it was already come to this with you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div><p/>And her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) ladyship, turning to her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) piano-forte, played --

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There was a young man in Ballinacrasy,
Who wanted a wife to make him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) unasy,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You make a most proper, but not sufficiently emphatic difference between having or suggesting such thoughts,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>said Lady Delacour. <div class="bookquote">``A gentleman sometimes finds it for his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) interest, his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) honour, or his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) pleasure, to suggest what he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) would not for the world promise, -- I mean perform.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And yet,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>said Lady Delacour, `you would have no scruple to trifle or flatter a woman out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) heart.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Cela est selon! ' said Clarence smiling; 'a fair exchange, you know, is no robbery.

 (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why I really have a great deal of discretion,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>said Lady Delacour; `but you trust too much to it when you expect that I should execute, both with propriety and success, the delicate commission of telling a young lady, who is under my protection, that a young gentleman, who is a professed admirer of mine, is in love with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), but has no thoughts, and wishes to suggest no thoughts, of marriage.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``In love!''  (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Clarence Hervey; `but when did I ever use the expression? In speaking of Miss Portman, I simply expressed esteem and ad--'

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No additions,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said Lady Delacour; `content yourself with esteem -- simply, -- and Miss Portman is safe, and you too, I presume. Apropos; pray, Clarence, how do your esteem and admiration -LRB-I may go as far as that, may not I?-RRB- of Miss Portman agree with your admiration of Lady Delacour?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Perfectly well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div>replied Clarence; `for all the world must be sensible that Clarence Hervey is a man of too much taste to compare a country novice in wit and accomplishments to Lady Delacour. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) might, as men of genius sometimes do, look forward to the idea of forming a country novice for a wife. A man must marry some time or other -- but my hour, thank Heaven, is not come yet.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank Heaven!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>said Lady Delacour; `for you know a married man is lost to the world of fashion and gallantry.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not more so, I should hope, than a married woman,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div>said Clarence Hervey. Here a loud knocking at the door announced the arrival of company to the concert. <div class="bookquote">``You will make my peace, you promise me, with Miss Portman,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div>cried Clarence eagerly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I will make your peace, and you shall see Belinda smile upon you once more, upon condition,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>continued Lady Delacour, speaking very quickly, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) was hurried by the sound of people coming up stairs -- `but we'll talk of that another time.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, nay, my dear Lady Delacour, now now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div>said Clarence, seizing her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) hand. -- <div class="bookquote">``Upon condition! upon what condition?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Upon condition that you do a little job for me -- indeed for Belinda. She (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) is to go with me to the birth-night, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) has often hinted to me that our horses are shockingly shabby for people of our condition. I know she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) wishes that upon such an occasion -- her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) first appearance at court, you know -- we should go in style. Now my dear positive lord has said he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) will not let us have a pair of the handsomest horses I ever saw, which are at Tattersal's, and on which Belinda, I know, has secretly set her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) heart, as I have openly, in vain.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Your ladyship and Miss Portman cannot possibly set your hearts on any thing in vain -- especially on any thing that it is in the power of Clarence Hervey to procure. Then,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>added he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>), gallantly kissing her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) hand, `may I thus seal my treaty of peace?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What audacity! -- don't you see these people coming in?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>cried Lady Delacour; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) withdrew her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) hand, but with no great precipitation. She (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) was evidently, `at this moment, as in all the past,'' neither afraid nor ashamed that Mr Hervey's devotions to her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) should be paid in public. With much address she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) had satisfied herself as to his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) views with respect to Belinda. She (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) was convinced that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) had no immediate thoughts of matrimony; but that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) were condemned to marry, Miss Portman would be his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) wife. As this did not interfere with her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) plans, Lady Delacour was content.

<p/>CHAPTER VI

<p/>Ways and Means

<p/>WHEN Lady Delacour repeated to Miss Portman the message about `simplicity of mind and dignity of character,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) frankly said -- <div class="bookquote">``Belinda, notwithstanding all this, observe, I'm determined to retain Clarence Hervey among the number of my public worshippers during my life -- which you know cannot last long. After I am gone, my dear, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>)'ll be all your own, and of that I give you joy. Posthumous fame is a silly thing, but posthumous jealousy detestable.''

 (<font color='red'><b>character</b></font>)</div><p/>There was one part of the conversation between Mr Hervey and her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) ladyship which she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>), in her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) great discretion, did not immediately repeat to Miss Portman -- that part which related to the horses. In this transaction Belinda had no farther share than having once, when her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) ladyship had the handsome horses brought for her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) to look at, assented to the opinion that they were the handsomest horses she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) ever beheld. Mr Hervey, however gallantly he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) replied to her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) ladyship, was secretly vexed to find that Belinda had so little delicacy as to permit her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) name to be employed in such a manner. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) repented having used the improper expression of dignity of mind, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) relapsed into his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) former opinion of Mrs Stanhope's niece. A relapse is always more dangerous than the first disease. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) sent home the horses to Lady Delacour the next day, and addressed Belinda, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) met her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>), with the air of a man of gallantry, who thought that his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) peace had been cheaply made. But in proportion as his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) manners became more familiar, hers grew more reserved. Lady Delacour rallied her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) prudery, but in vain. Clarence Hervey seemed to think that her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) ladyship had not fulfilled her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) part of the bargain. <div class="bookquote">``Is not smiling,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>), `the epithet always applied to peace? yet I have not been able to obtain one smile from Miss Portman since I have been promised peace.'' Embarrassed by Mr Hervey's reproaches, and provoked to find that Belinda was proof against all her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) raillery, Lady Delacour grew quite ill-humoured towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>). Belinda, unconscious of having given any just cause of offence, was unmoved; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) ladyship's embarrassment increased. At last, resuming all her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) former appearance of friendship and confidence, she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) suddenly exclaimed one night after she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) had flattered Belinda into high spirits --

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you know, my dear, that I have been so ashamed of myself for this week past, that I have hardly dared to look you in the face. I am sensible I was downright rude and cross to you one day, and ever since I have been penitent; and, as all penitents are, very stupid and disagreeable, I am sure: but tell me you forgive my caprice, and Lady Delacour will be herself again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div><p/>It was not difficult to obtain Belinda's forgiveness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>continued Lady Delacour, `you are too good; but then in my own justification I must say, that I have more things to make me ill-humoured than most people have. Now, my dear, that most obstinate of human beings, Lord Delacour, has reduced me to the most terrible situation -- I have made Clarence Hervey buy a pair of horses for me, and I cannot make my Lord Delacour pay for them; but I forgot to tell you that I took your name -- not in vain indeed -- in this business. I told Clarence, that upon condition he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) would do this job for me, you would forgive him (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) for all his (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) sins, and -- nay, my dear, why do you look as if I had stabbed you to the heart? -- after all, I only drew upon your pretty mouth for a few smiles. Pray let me see whether it has actually forgotten how to smile.''

<p/>Belinda was too much vexed at this instant to understand raillery. She (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) was inspired by anger with unwonted courage, and, losing all fear of Lady Delacour's wit, she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) very seriously expostulated with her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) ladyship upon having thus used her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) name without her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) consent or knowledge. Belinda felt she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) was now in danger of being led into a situation which might be fatal to her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) reputation and her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) happiness; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) was the more surprised at her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) ladyship, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) recollected the history she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) had so lately heard of Harriot Freke and Colonel Lawless.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You cannot but be sensible, Lady Delacour,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Belinda, `that after the contempt I have heard Mr Hervey express for match-making with Mrs Stanhope's nieces, I should degrade myself by any attempts to attract his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) attention. No wit, no eloquence, can change my opinion upon this subject -- I cannot endure contempt.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very likely -- no doubt' -- interrupted Lady Delacour; `but if you would only open your eyes, which heroines make it a principle never to do -- or else there would be an end of the novel -- if you would only open your eyes, you would see that this man is in love with you; and whilst you are afraid of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) contempt, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is a hundred times more afraid of yours; and as long as you are each of you in such fear of you know not what, you must excuse me if I indulge myself in a little wholesome raillery.''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>-- Belinda smiled. -- <div class="bookquote">``There now; one such smile as that for Clarence Hervey, and I'm out of debt and danger,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>said Lady Delacour.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``O Lady Delacour, why, why will you try your power over me in this manner?''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Belinda. <div class="bookquote">``You know that I ought not to be persuaded to do what I am conscious is wrong. But a few days ago you told me yourself that Mr Hervey is -- is not a marrying man; and a woman of your penetration must see that -- that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) only means to flirt with me. I am not a match for Mr Hervey in any respect. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) is a man of wit and gallantry -- I am unpractised in the ways of the world. I was not educated by my aunt Stanhope -- I have only been with her (<font color='blue'><b>Stanhope</b></font>) a few years -- I wish I had never been with her (<font color='blue'><b>Stanhope</b></font>) in my life.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll take care Mr Hervey shall know that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>said Lady Delacour; `but in the mean time I do think any fair appraiser of delicate distresses would decide that I am, all the circumstances considered, more to be pitied at this present moment than you are: for the catastrophe of the business evidently is, that I must pay two hundred guineas for the horses somehow or other.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can pay for them,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Belinda, `and will with the greatest pleasure. I will not go to the birthnight -- my dress is not bespoke. Will two hundred guineas pay for the horses? Oh, take the money -- pay Mr Hervey, dear Lady Delacour, and it will all be right.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are a charming girl,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>said Lady Delacour, embracing her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>); `but how can I answer for it to my conscience, or to your aunt Stanhope, if you don't appear on the birthnight? That cannot be, my dear; besides, you know Mrs Franks will send home your drawing-room dress to-day, and it would be so foolish to be presented for nothing -- not to go to the birthnight afterwards. If you say a you must say b.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Belinda, <div class="bookquote">``I will not go to the drawing-room.''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>-- <div class="bookquote">``Not go, my dear! What! throw away fifty guineas for nothing! Really I never saw any one so lavish of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) money, and so economic of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) smiles.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Surely,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Miss Portman, `it is better for me to throw away fifty guineas, poor as I am, than to hazard the happiness of my life. Your ladyship knows that if I say a to Mr Hervey, I must say b. No, no, my dear Lady Delacour; here is the draught for two hundred guineas: pay Mr Hervey, for Heaven's sake, and there is an end of the business.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What a positive child it is! Well, then, it shall not be forced to say the a, b, c, of Cupid's alphabet, to that terrible pedagogue, Clarence Hervey, till it pleases: but seriously, Miss Portman, I am concerned that you will make me take this draught: it is absolutely robbing you. But Lord Delacour's the person you must blame -- it is all his (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) obstinacy: having once said he (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) would not pay for the horses, he (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) would see them and me and the whole human race expire before he (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) would change his (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) silly mind. -- Next month I shall have it in my power, my dear, to repay you with a thousand thanks; and in a few months more we shall have another birthday, and a new star shall appear in the firmament of fashion, and it shall be called Belinda. In the mean time, my dear, upon second thoughts, perhaps we can get Mrs Franks to dispose of your drawing-room dress to some person of taste, and you may keep your fifty guineas for the next occasion. I'll see what can be done. -- Adieu! a thousand thanks, silly child as you are.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Franks</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs Franks at first declared that it would be an impossibility to dispose of Miss Portman's dress, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) would do any thing upon earth to oblige Lady Delacour; however, ten guineas made every thing possible. Belinda rejoiced at having, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) thought, extricated herself at so cheap a rate; and well pleased with her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) own conduct, she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) wrote to her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) aunt Stanhope, to inform her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) of as much of the transaction as she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) could disclose, without betraying Lady Delacour. <div class="bookquote">``Her (<font color='blue'><b>Franks</b></font>) ladyship,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) said, `had immediate occasion for two hundred guineas, and to accommodate her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) with this sum she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) had given up the idea of going to court.''

<p/>The tenor of Miss Portman's letter will be sufficiently apparent from Mrs Stanhope's answer.

<p/>MRS STANHOPE TO MISS PORTMAN.

<p/>``Bath, June 2nd.

<p/>``I cannot but feel some astonishment, Belinda, at your very extraordinary conduct, and more extraordinary letter. What you can mean by principles and delicacy I own I don't pretend to understand, when I see you not only forget the respect that is due to the opinions and advice of the aunt to whom you owe every thing; but you take upon yourself to lavish her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) money, without common honesty. I send you two hundred guineas, and desire you to go to court -- you lend my two hundred guineas to Lady Delacour, and inform me that as you think yourself bound in honour to her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) ladyship, you cannot explain all the particulars to me, otherwise you are sure I should approve of the reasons which have influenced you. Mighty satisfactory, truly! And then, to mend the matter, you tell me that you do not think that in your situation in life it is necessary that you should go to court. Your opinions, and mine, you add, differ in many points. Then I must say that you are as ungrateful as you are presumptuous; for I am not such a novice in the affairs of the world as to be ignorant that when a young lady professes to be of a different opinion from her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) friends, it is only a prelude to something worse. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) begins by saying that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) is determined to think for herself, and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) is determined to act for herself -- and then it is all over with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>): and all the money, &c. that has been spent upon her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) education is so much dead loss to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) friends.

<p/>``Now I look upon it that a young girl who has been brought up, and brought forward in the world as you have been by connexions, is bound to be guided implicitly by them in all her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) conduct. What should you think of a man who, after he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had been brought into parliament by a friend, would go and vote against that friend's opinions? You do not want sense, Belinda -- you perfectly understand me; and consequently your errors I must impute to the defect of your heart, and not of your judgment. I see that, on account of the illness of the princess, the king's birthday is put off for a fortnight. If you manage properly, and if -LRB-unknown to Lady --, who certainly has not used you well in this business, and to whom therefore you owe no peculiar delicacy-RRB- you make Lord --, sensible how much your aunt Stanhope is disappointed and displeased -LRB-as I most truly am-RRB- at your intention of missing this opportunity of appearing at court; it is ten to one but his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) lordship -- who has not made it a point to refuse your request, I suppose -- will pay you your two hundred guineas. You of course will make proper acknowledgments; but at the same time entreat that his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) lordship will not commit you with his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) ladyship, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Stanhope</b></font>) might be offended at your application to him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>). I understand from an intimate acquaintance of his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>), that you are a great favourite of his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) lordship; and though an obstinate, he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) is a good-natured man, and can have no fear of being governed by you; consequently he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) will do just as you would have him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>).

<p/>``Then you have an opportunity of representing the thing in the prettiest manner imaginable to Lady --, as an instance of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) lord's consideration for her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>): so you will oblige all parties -LRB-a very desirable thing-RRB- without costing yourself one penny, and go to the birthnight after all: and this only by using a little address, without which nothing is to be done in this world.

<p/>``Yours affectionately -LRB-if you follow my advice-RRB-,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``SELINA STANHOPE.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div><p/>Belinda, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) could not, consistently with what she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) thought right, follow the advice so artfully given to her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) in this epistle, was yet extremely concerned to find that she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) had incurred the displeasure of an aunt to whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) thought herself under obligations. She (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) resolved to lay by as much as she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) possibly could, from the interest of her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) fortune, and to repay the two hundred guineas to Mrs Stanhope. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>) was conscious that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>) had no right to lend this money to Lady Delacour, if her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) aunt had expressly desired that she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) should spend it only on her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) court-dress; but this had not distinctly been expressed when Mrs Stanhope sent her (<font color='blue'><b>Stanhope</b></font>) niece the draft. That lady was in the habit of speaking and writing ambiguously, so that even those who knew her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) best were frequently in doubt how to interpret her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) words. Yet she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was extremely displeased when her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) hints and her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) half-expressed wishes were not understood. Beside the concern she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) felt from the thoughts of having displeased her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) aunt, Belinda was both vexed and mortified to perceive that in Clarence Hervey's manner towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) there was not the change which she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) had expected that her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) conduct would naturally produce.

<p/>One day she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) was surprised at his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) reproaching her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) for caprice in having given up her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) intentions of going to court. Lady Delacour's embarrassment whilst Mr Hervey spoke, Belinda attributed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) ladyship's desire that Clarence should not know that she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) had been obliged to borrow the money to pay him (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) for the horses. Belinda thought that this was a species of mean pride; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) made it a point to keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) ladyship's secret -- she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) therefore slightly answered Mr Hervey, `that she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) wondered that a man who was so well acquainted with the female sex should be surprised at any instance of caprice from a woman.'' The conversation then took another turn, and whilst they were talking of indifferent subjects, in came Lord Delacour's man, Champfort, with Mrs Stanhope's draft for two hundred guineas, which the coachmaker's man had just brought back because Miss Portman had forgotten to endorse it. Belinda's astonishment was almost as great at this instant as Lady Delacour's confusion.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come this way, my dear, and we'll find you a pen and ink. You need not wait, Champfort; but tell the man to wait for the draft -- Miss Portman will endorse it immediately.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>-- And she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) took Belinda into another room.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good Heavens! Has not this money been paid to Mr Hervey?''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Belinda.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, my dear; but I will take all the blame upon myself, or, which will do just as well for you, throw it all upon my better half. My Lord Delacour would not pay for my new carriage. The coachmaker, insolent animal, would not let it out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) yard without two hundred guineas in ready money. Now you know I had the horses, and what could I do with the horses without the carriage? Clarence Hervey, I knew, could wait for his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) money better than a poor devil of a coachmaker; so I paid the coachmaker, and a few months sooner or later can make no difference to Clarence, who rolls in gold, my dear -- if that will be any comfort to you, as I hope it will.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, what will he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) think of me!''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Belinda.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, what will he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) think of me, child!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Lady Delacour,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Belinda, in a firmer tone than she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) had ever before spoken, <div class="bookquote">``I must insist upon this draft being given to Mr Hervey.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Absolutely impossible, my dear. -- I cannot take it from the coachmaker; he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) has sent home the carriage: the thing's done, and cannot be undone. But come, since I know nothing else will make you easy, I will take this mighty favour from Mr Hervey entirely upon my own conscience: you cannot object to that, for you are not the keeper of my conscience. I will tell Clarence the whole business, and do you honour due, my dear: so endorse the check, whilst I go and sound both the praises of your dignity of mind, and simplicity of character, &c. &c. &c. &c.''

 (<font color='red'><b>ladyship</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) ladyship broke away from Belinda, returned to Clarence Hervey, and told the whole affair with that peculiar grace with which she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) knew how to make a good story of a bad one. Clarence was as favourable an auditor at this time as she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) could possibly have found; for no human being could value money less than he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) did, and all sense of her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) ladyship's meanness was lost in his (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) joy at discovering that Belinda was worthy of his (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) esteem. Now he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) felt in its fullest extent all the power she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) had over his (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) heart, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) was upon the point of declaring his (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) attachment to her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>), when malheureusement Sir Philip Baddely and Mr Rochfort announced themselves by the noise they made on the staircase. These were the young men who had spoken in such a contemptuous manner at Lady Singleton's of the match-making Mrs Stanhope and her (<font color='blue'><b>Stanhope</b></font>) nieces. Mr Hervey was anxious that they should not penetrate into the state of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) heart, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) concealed his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) emotion by instantly assuming that kind of rattling gaiety which always delighted his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) companions, who were ever in want of some one to set their stagnant ideas in motion. At last they insisted upon carrying Clarence away with them to taste some wines for Sir Philip Baddely.

<p/>CHAPTER VII

<p/>The Serpentine River

<p/>IN his (<font color='blue'><b>Baddely</b></font>) way to St James's-street, where the wine-merchant lived, Sir Philip Baddely picked up several young men of his (<font color='blue'><b>Baddely</b></font>) acquaintance, who were all eager to witness a trial of taste, of epicurean taste, between the baronet and Clarence Hervey. Amongst his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) other accomplishments our hero piqued himself upon the exquisite accuracy of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) organs of taste. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) neither loved wine, nor was he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) fond of eating; but at fine dinners, with young men who were real epicures, Hervey gave himself the airs of a connoisseur, and asserted superiority even in judging of wine and sauces. Having gained immortal honour at an entertainment by gravely protesting that some turtle would have been excellent if it had not been done a bubble too much, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) presumed, elate as he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) was wih the applauses of the company, to assert, that no man in England had a more correct taste than himself. -- Sir Philip Baddely could not passively submit to this arrogance; he (<font color='blue'><b>Baddely</b></font>) loudly proclaimed, that though he (<font color='blue'><b>Baddely</b></font>) would not dispute Mr Hervey's judgment as far as eating was concerned, yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) would defy him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) as a connoisseur of wines, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) offered to submit the competition to any eminent wine-merchant in London, and to some common friend of acknowledged taste and experience. -- Mr Rochfort was chosen as the common friend of acknowledged taste and experience; and a fashionable wine-merchant was pitched upon to decide with him (<font color='blue'><b>Rochfort</b></font>) the merits of these candidates for bacchanalian fame. Sir Philip, who was just going to furnish his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) cellars, was a person of importance to the wine-merchant, who produced accordingly his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) choicest treasures. Sir Philip and Clarence tasted of all in their turns; Sir Philip with real, and Clarence with affected gravity; and they delivered their opinions of the positive and comparative merits of each. The wine-merchant evidently, as Mr Hervey thought, leaned towards Sir Philip. <div class="bookquote">``Upon my word, Sir Philip, you are right -- that wine is the best I have -- you certainly have a most discriminating taste,''  (<font color='red'><b>the wine-merchant</b></font>)</div>said the complaisant wine-merchant.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll tell you what,''  (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Philip Baddely</b></font>)</div>cried Sir Philip, `the thing is this: by Jove! now, there's no possibility now -- no possibility now, by Jove! of imposing upon me.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div>said Clarence Hervey, `would you engage to tell the differences between these two wines ten times running, blindfold?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ten times! that's nothing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Philip Baddely</b></font>)</div>replied Sir Philip: `yes, fifty times, I would, by Jove!''

<p/>But when it came to the trial, Sir Philip had nothing left but oaths in his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) own favour. Clarence Hervey was victorious; and his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) sense of the importance of this victory was much increased by the fumes of the wine, which began to operate upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) brain. His (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) triumph was, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) said it ought to be, bacchanalian: he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) laughed and sang with anacreontic spirit, and finished by declaring that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) deserved to be crowned with vine-leaves.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dine with me, Clarence,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Rochfort, `and we'll crown you with three times three; and,<div class="bookquote">'' whispered he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) to Sir Philip, `we'll have another trial after dinner.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But as it's not near dinner-time yet -- what shall we do with ourselves till dinner-time?''  (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Philip Baddely</b></font>)</div>said Sir Philip, yawning pathetically.

<p/>Clarence not being used to drink in a morning, though all his (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) companions were, was much affected by the wine, and Rochfort proposed that they should take a turn in the park to cool Hervey's head. To Hyde-park they repaired; Sir Philip boasting, all the way they walked, of the superior strength of his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) head.

<p/>Clarence protested that his (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) own was stronger than any man's in England, and observed that at this instant he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) walked better than any person in company, Sir Philip Baddely not excepted. Now Sir Philip Baddely was a noted pedestrian, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Baddely</b></font>) immediately challenged our hero to walk with him (<font color='blue'><b>Baddely</b></font>) for any money he (<font color='blue'><b>Baddely</b></font>) pleased. <div class="bookquote">``Done,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div>said Clarence, `for ten guineas -- for any money you please:' and instantly they set out to walk, as Rochfort cried `one, two, three, and away; keep the path, and whichever reaches that elm tree first has it.''

<p/>They were exactly even for some yards, then Clarence got ahead of Sir Philip, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) reached the elm tree first; but as he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) waved his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) hat, exclaiming, <div class="bookquote">``Clarence has won the day,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Sir Philip came up with his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) companions, and coolly informed him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) had lost his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) wager -- <div class="bookquote">``Lost! lost! lost! Clarence -- fairly lost.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Didn't I reach the tree first?''  (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div>said Clarence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>companions</b></font>)</div>answered his (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) companions; `but you didn't keep the path. You turned out of the way when you met that crowd of children yonder.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now I,''  (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Philip Baddely</b></font>)</div>said Sir Philip, `dashed fairly through them -- kept the path, and won my bet.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div>said Hervey, `would you have had me run over that little child, who was stooping down just in my way?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I! not I,''  (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Philip Baddely</b></font>)</div>said Sir Philip; `but I would have you go through with your civility: if a man will be polite, he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) must pay for his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) politeness sometimes. -- You said you'd lay me any money I pleased, recollect -- now I'm very moderate -- and as you are a particular friend, Clarence, I'll only take your ten guineas.''

<p/>A loud laugh from his (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) companions provoked Clarence; they were glad `to have a laugh against him (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>),'' because he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) excited universal envy by the real superiority of his (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) talents, and by his (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) perpetually taking the lead in those trifles which were beneath his (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) ambition, and exactly suited to engage the attention of his (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) associates.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Be it so, and welcome; I'll pay ten guineas for having better manners than any of you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div>cried Hervey, laughing; `but remember, though I've lost this bet, I don't give up my pedestrian fame. -- Sir Philip, there are no women to throw golden apples in my way now, and no children for me to stumble over: I dare you to another trial -- double or quit.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm off by Jove!''  (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Philip Baddely</b></font>)</div>said Sir Philip. <div class="bookquote">``I'm too hot, damme, to walk with you any more -- but I'm your man if you've a mind for a swim -- here's the Serpentine river, Clarence -- hey! damn it! -- hey?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Philip Baddely</b></font>)</div><p/>Sir Philip and all his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) companions knew that Clarence had never learned to swim.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You may wink at one another, as wisely as you please,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div>said Clarence, `but come on, my boys -- I am your man for a swim -- a hundred guineas about it!

<p/>-- <div class="bookquote">``Darest thou, Rochfort, now
Leap in with me into this weedy flood,
And swim to yonder point?'' (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div>'
and instantly Hervey, who had in his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) confused head some recollection of an essay of Dr Franklin on swimming, by which he (<font color='blue'><b>Franklin</b></font>) fancied that he (<font color='blue'><b>Franklin</b></font>) could ensure at once his (<font color='blue'><b>Franklin</b></font>) safety and his (<font color='blue'><b>Franklin</b></font>) fame, threw off his (<font color='blue'><b>Franklin</b></font>) coat and jumped into the river -- luckily he (<font color='blue'><b>Franklin</b></font>) was not in boots. Rochfort, and all the other young men stood laughing by the river side.
<div class="bookquote">``Who the devil are these two that seem to be making up to us?''  (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Philip Baddely</b></font>)</div>said Sir Philip, looking at two gentlemen who were coming towards them; <div class="bookquote">``St George, hey? you know every body.''

 (<font color='red'><b>gentlemen</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The foremost is Percival, of Oakly-park, I think, `pon my honour,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr St George/St George/George</b></font>)</div>replied Mr St George, and he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) then began to settle how many thousands a year Mr Percival was worth. This point was not decided when the gentlemen came up to the spot where Sir Philip was standing.

<p/>The child for whose sake Clarence Hervey had lost his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) bet was Mr Percival's, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) came to thank him (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) for his (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) civility. -- The gentleman who accompanied Mr Percival was an old friend of Clarence Hervey's; he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) had met him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) abroad, but had not seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) for some years.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Pray, gentlemen,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) to Sir Philip and his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) party, `is Mr Clarence Hervey amongst you? I think I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) pass by me just now.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Damn it, yes -- where is Clary, though?''  (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Philip Baddely</b></font>)</div>exlaimed Sir Philip, suddenly recollecting himself. -- Clarence Hervey at this instant was drowning: he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) had got out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) depth, and had struggled in vain to recover himself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Curse me, if it's not all over with Clary,''  (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Philip Baddely</b></font>)</div>continued Sir Philip. <div class="bookquote">``Do any of you see his (<font color='blue'><b>Clary</b></font>) head any where? Damn you, Rochfort, yonder it is.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Damme, so it is,''  (<font color='red'><b>Rochfort/Mr Rochfort</b></font>)</div>said Rochfort; `but he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)'s so heavy in his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) clothes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)'d pull me down along with him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) to Davy's locker: -- damme, if I'll go after him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>).''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Damn it, though, can't some of ye swim? Can't some of ye jump in?''  (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Philip Baddely</b></font>)</div>cried Sir Philip, turning to his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) companions: `damn it, Clarence will go to the bottom.''

<p/>And so he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) inevitably would have done, had not Mr Percival at this instant leaped into the river, and seized hold of the drowning Clarence. It was with great difficulty that he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) dragged him (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) to the shore. -- Sir Philip's party, as soon as the danger was over, officiously offered their assistance. Clarence Hervey was absolutely senseless. <div class="bookquote">``Damn it, what shall we do with him (<font color='blue'><b>Clary</b></font>) now?''  (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Philip Baddely</b></font>)</div>said Sir Philip: <div class="bookquote">``Damn it, we must call some of the people from the boat-house -- he (<font color='blue'><b>Clary</b></font>)'s as heavy as lead: damn me, if I know what to do with him2.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Philip Baddely</b></font>)</div><p/>Whilst Sir Philip was damning himself, Mr Percival ran to the boat-house for assistance, and they carried the body into the house. The elderly gentleman who had accompanied Mr Percival now made his (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) way through the midst of the noisy crowd, and directed what should be done to restore Mr Hervey's suspended animation. Whilst he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) was employed in this benevolent manner, Clarence's worthy friends were sneering at him (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>), and whispering to one another: <div class="bookquote">``Ecod, he (<font color='blue'><b>Clary</b></font>) talks as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Clary</b></font>) was a doctor,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>said Rochfort.

<p/><div class="bookquote">''`Pon honour, I do believe,''  (<font color='red'><b>Rochfort/Mr Rochfort</b></font>)</div>said St George, `he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) is the famous Dr X--; I met him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) at a circulating library t`other day.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dr X-- the writer, do you mean?''  (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Philip Baddely</b></font>)</div>said Sir Philip; `then, damn me, we'd better get out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) way as fast as we can, or he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)'ll have some of us down in black and white; and curse me, if I should choose to meet with myself in a book.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No danger of that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Philip Baddely</b></font>)</div>said Rochfort; `for how can one meet with oneself in a book, Sir Philip, if one never opens one? -- By Jove, that's the true way.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But, `pon my honour,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr St George/St George/George</b></font>)</div>said St George, <div class="bookquote">``I should like of all things to see myself in print; `twould make one famously famous.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr St George/St George/George</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Damn me, if I don't flatter myself, though, one can make oneself famous enough to all intents and purposes without having any thing to say to these author geniuses. You're a famous fellow, faith! to want to see yourself in print -- I'll publish this in Bond-street: damn it, in point of famousness, I'd sport my Random against all the books that ever were read or written, damn me! But what are we doing here?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hervey's in good hands,''  (<font color='red'><b>Rochfort/Mr Rochfort</b></font>)</div>said Rochfort, `and this here's a cursed stupid lounge for us -- besides, it's getting towards dinner-time; so my voice is, let's be off, and we can leave St George -LRB-who has such a famous mind to be in the doctor's book-RRB- to bring Clary after us, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Clary</b></font>)'s ready for dinner and good company again, you know -- ha! ha! ha!''

<p/>Away the faithful friends went to the important business of their day.

<p/>When Clarence Hervey came to his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) senses he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) started up, rubbed his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) eyes, and looked about, exclaiming -- <div class="bookquote">``What's all this? -- Where am I? -- Where's Baddely? -- Where's Rochfort? -- Where are they all?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Gone home to dinner,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr St George/St George/George</b></font>)</div>answered Mr St George, who was a hanger-on of Sir Philips's; `but they left me to bring you after them. Faith, Clary, you've had a squeak for your life! ``Pon my honour, we thought at one time it was all over with you -- but you're a tough one: we shan't have to ``pour over your grave a full bottle of red<div class="bookquote">'' as yet, my boy -- you'll do as well as ever. So I'll step and call a coach for you, Clary, and we shall be at dinner as soon as the best of 'em, after all, by jingo! I leave you in good hands with the doctor here, that brought you to life, and the gentleman that dragged you out of the water. Here's a note for you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr St George/St George/George</b></font>)</div>whispered Mr St George, as he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) leaned over Clarence Hervey -- `here's a note for you from Sir Philip and Rochfort: read it, do you mind, to yourself'

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If I can,''  (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Philip Baddely</b></font>)</div>said Clarence; `but Sir Philip writes a bloody bad hand 3.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochfort</b></font>)'s a baronet,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr St George/St George/George</b></font>)</div>said St George, `ha! ha! ha!'' and, charmed with his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) own wit, he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) left the boat-house.

<p/>Clarence with some difficulty deciphered the note, which contained these words:

<p/>``Quiz the doctor, Cary, as soon as you are up to it -- he (<font color='blue'><b>Cary</b></font>)'s an author -- so fair game -- quiz the doctor, and we'll drink your health with three times three in Rochfort's burgundy.

<p/>``Yours, &c.
``PHIL. BADDELY.
<div class="bookquote">``P.S. Burn this when read.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div><p/>With the request contained in the postscript Clarence immediately complied; he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) threw the note into the fire with indignation the moment that he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) had read it, and turning towards the gentleman to whom it alluded, he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) began to express, in the strongest terms, his (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) gratitude for their benevolence. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) stopped short in the midst of his (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) acknowledgments, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) discovered to whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) was speaking.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dr X--!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>cried he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Is it possible? How rejoiced I am to see you, and how rejoiced I am to be obliged to you! There is not a man in England to whom I would rather be obliged.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are not acquainted with Mr Percival, I believe,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dr</b></font>)</div>said Dr X--: `give me leave, Mr Percival, to introduce to you the young gentleman whose life you have saved, and whose life -- though, by the company in which you found him (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>), you might not think so -- is worth saving. This, sir, is no less a man than Mr Clarence Hervey, of whose universal genius you have just had a specimen; for which he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) was crowned with sedges, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) well deserved, by the god of the Serpentine river. Do not be so unjust as to imagine that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) has any of the presumption which is sometimes the chief characteristic of a man of universal genius. Mr Clarence Hervey is, without exception, the most humble man of my acquaintance; for whilst all good judges would think him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) fit company for Mr Percival, he (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) has the humility to think himself upon a level with Mr Rochfort and Sir Philip Baddely.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You have lost as little of your satirical wit, Dr X--, as of your active benevolence, I perceive,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div>said Clarence Hervey, `since I met you abroad. But as I cannot submit to your unjust charge of humility, you will tell me where you are to be found in town, and to-morrow -- ,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``To-morrow, and to-morrow, and to-morrow,''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>said Dr X--: `why not to-day?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am engaged,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div>said Clarence, hesitating and laughing -- ``I am unfortunately engaged to-day to dine with Mr Rochfort and Sir Philip Baddely, and in the evening I am to be at Lady Delacour<div class="bookquote">``s.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Lady Delacour! Not the same Lady Delacour whom four years ago, when we met at Florence, you compared to the Venus de Medici -- no, no, it cannot be the same -- a goddess of four years' standing! -- Incredible!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Incredible as it seems,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div>said Clarence, `it is true: I admire her (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) ladyship more than ever I did.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Like a true connoisseur,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dr</b></font>)</div>said Dr X--, `you admire a fine picture the older it grows: I hear that her (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) ladyship's face is really one of the finest pieces of painting extant, with the advantage of

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ev'ry grace which time alone can grant.'' (<font color='red'><b>ladyship</b></font>)</div>'
<div class="bookquote">``Come, come, Dr X--,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr Percival</b></font>)</div>cried Mr Percival, `no more wit at Lady Delacour's expense: I have a fellow-feeling for Mr Hervey.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, you are not in love with her (<font color='blue'><b>goddess</b></font>) ladyship, are you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Dr</b></font>)</div>said Dr X--. <div class="bookquote">``I am not in love with Lady Delacour's picture of herself,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr Percival</b></font>)</div>replied Mr Percival, `but I was once in love with the original.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How? -- When? -- Where?''  (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div>cried Clarence Hervey, in a tone totally different from that in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) had first addressed Mr Percival.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``To-morrow you shall know the how, the when, and the where,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr Percival</b></font>)</div>said Mr Percival: `here's your friend, Mr St George, and his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) coach.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The deuce take him (<font color='blue'><b>connoisseur</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div>said Clarence: `but tell me, is it possible that you are not in love with her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) still? -- and why?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr Percival</b></font>)</div>said Mr Percival -- `why? Come to-morrow, as you have promised, to Upper Grosvenor-street, and let me introduce you to Lady Anne Percival; she (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) can answer your question better than I can -- if not entirely to your satisfaction, at least entirely to mine, which is more surprising, as the lady is my wife.''

<p/>By this time Clarence Hervey was equipped in a dry suit of clothes; and by the strength of an excellent constitution, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) had never injured, even amongst his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) dissipated associates, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) had recovered from the effects of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) late imprudence. -- <div class="bookquote">``Clary, let's away, here's the coach,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr St George/St George/George</b></font>)</div>said Mr St George. ``Why, my boy -- that's a famous fellow, faith! -- why, you look the better for being drowned. <div class="bookquote">``Pon honour, if I were you, I would jump into the Serpentine river once a day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If I could always be sure of such good friends to pull me out,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div>said Hervey. -- <div class="bookquote">``Pray, St George, by-the-bye, what were you, and Rochfort, and Sir Philip, and all the rest of my friends doing, whilst I was drowning?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't say particularly, upon my soul,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr St George/St George/George</b></font>)</div>replied Mr St George; `for my own part, I was in boots, so you know I was out of the question. But what signifies all that now? Come, come, we had best think of looking after our dinners.''

<p/>Clarence Hervey, who had very quick feelings, was extremely hurt by the indifference which his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) dear friends had shown when his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) life was in danger: he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) was apt to believe that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) was really an object of affection and admiration amongst his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) companions; and that though they were neither very wise, nor very witty, they were certainly very good-natured. When they had forfeited, by their late conduct, these claims to his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) regard, his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) partiality for them was changed into contempt.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You had better come home and dine with me, Mr Hervey,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr Percival</b></font>)</div>said Mr Percival, `if you be not absolutely engaged; for here is your physician, who tells me that temperance is necessary for a man just recovered from drowning, and Mr Rochfort keeps too good a table, I am told, for one in your condition.''

<p/>Clarence accepted of this invitation with a degree of pleasure which perfectly astonished Mr St George.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Every man knows his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) own affairs best,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) to Clarence, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) stepped into his (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) hackney coach; `but for my share, I will do my friend Rochfort the justice to say that no one lives as well as he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochfort</b></font>) does.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If to live well mean nothing but to eat,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div>said Clarence.
<div class="bookquote">``Now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dr</b></font>)</div>said Dr X--, looking at his (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) watch, `it will be eight o'clock by the time we get to Upper Grosvenor-street, and Lady Anne will probably have waited dinner for us about two hours, which I apprehend is sufficient to try the patience of any woman but Griselda. Do not,<div class="bookquote">'' continued he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>), turning to Clarence Hervey, `expect to see an old-fashioned, spiritless, patient Griselda, in Lady Anne Percival: I can assure you that she (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) is -- but I will neither tell you what she (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) is, nor what she (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) is not. Every man who has any abilities, likes to have the pleasure and honour of finding out a character by his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) own penetration, instead of having it forced upon him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) at full length in capital letters of gold, finely emblazoned and illuminated by the hand of some injudicious friend: every child thinks the violet of his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) own finding the sweetest. I spare you any farther allusion and illustrations,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dr</b></font>)</div>concluded Dr X--, `for here we are, thank God, in Upper Grosvenor-street.''

<p/>CHAPTER VIII

<p/>A Family Party

<p/>THEY found Lady Anne Percival in the midst of her (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) children, who all turned their healthy, rosy, intelligent faces towards the door, the moment that they heard their father's voice. Clarence Hervey was so much struck with the expression of happiness in Lady Anne's countenance, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) absolutely forgot to compare her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) beauty with Lady Delacour's. Whether her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) eyes were large or small, blue or hazel, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) could not tell; nay, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) might have been puzzled if he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) had been asked the colour of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) hair. Whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) were handsome by the rules of art, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) knew not; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had the essential charm of beauty, the power of prepossessing the heart immediately in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) favour. The effect of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) manners, like that of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) beauty, was rather to be felt than described. Every body was at ease in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) company, and none thought themselves called upon to admire her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>). To Clarence Hervey, who had been used to the brilliant and exigeante Lady Delacour, this respite from the fatigue of admiration was peculiarly agreeable. The unconstrained cheerfulness of Lady Anne Percival spoke a mind at ease, and immediately imparted happiness by exacting sympathy; but in Lady Delacour's wit and gaiety there was an appearance of art and effort, which often destroyed the pleasure that she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) wished to communicate. Mr Hervey was, perhaps unusually, disposed to reflection, by having just escaped from drowning; for he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) had made all these comparisons, and came to this conclusion, with the accuracy of a metaphysician, who has been accustomed to study cause and effect -- indeed there was no species of knowledge for which he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) had not taste and talents, though, to please fools, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) too often affected `the bliss of ignorance.''

<p/>The children at Lady Anne Percival's happened to be looking at some gold fish, which were in a glass globe, and Dr X--, who was a general favourite with the younger as well as with the elder part of the family, was seized upon the moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) entered the room: a pretty little girl of five years old took him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) prisoner by the flap of the coat, whilst two of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) brothers assailed him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) with questions about the ears, eyes, and fins of fishes. One of the little boys filliped the glass globe, and observed, that the fish immediately came to the surface of the water, and seemed to hear the noise very quickly; but his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) brother doubted whether the fish heard the noise, and remarked, that they might be disturbed by seeing or feeling the motion of the water, when the glass was struck.

<p/>Dr X-- observed, that this was a very learned dispute, and that the question had been discussed by no less a person than the Abbé Nollet; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) related some of the ingenious experiments tried by that gentleman, to decide whether fishes can or cannot hear. Whilst the doctor was speaking, Clarence Hervey was struck with the intelligent countenance of one of the little auditors, a girl of about ten or twelve years old; he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) was surprised to discover in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) features, though not in their expression, a singular resemblance to Lady Delacour. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) remarked this to Mr Percival, and the child, who overheard him (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>), blushed as red as scarlet. Dinner was announced at this instant, and Clarence Hervey thought no more of the circumstance, attributing the girl's blush to confusion at being looked at so earnestly. One of the little boys whispered as they were going down to dinner, <div class="bookquote">``Helena, I do believe that this is the good-natured gentleman who went out of the path to make room for us, instead of running over us as the other man did.''  (<font color='red'><b>the boys</b></font>)</div>The children agreed that Clarence Hervey certainly was the good-natured gentleman, and upon the strength of this observation, one of the boys posted himself next to Clarence at dinner, and by all the little playful manoeuvres in his (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) power endeavoured to show his (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) gratitude, and to cultivate a friendship which had been thus auspiciously commenced. Mr Hervey, who piqued himself upon being able always to suit his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) conversation to his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) companions, distinguished himself at dinner by an account of the Chinese fighting-bird, from which he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) passed to the various ingenious methods of fishing practised by the Russian Cossacks. From modern he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) went to ancient fish, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) talked of that which was so much admired by the Roman epicures for exhibiting a succession of beautiful colours whilst it is dying; and which was, upon that account, always suffered to die in the presence of the guests, as part of the entertainment -- Clarence was led on by the questions of the children from fishes to birds; he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) spoke of the Roman aviaries, which were so constructed as to keep from the sight of the prisoners that they contained, `the fields, woods, and every object which might remind them of their former liberty.'' -- From birds he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) was going on to beasts, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) was nearly struck dumb by the forbidding severity with which an elderly lady, who sat opposite to him (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>), fixed her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) eyes upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) had not, till this instant, paid the smallest attention to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>); but her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) stern countenance was now so strongly contrasted with the approving looks of the children who sat next to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), that he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) could not help remarking it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) asked her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) to do him (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) the honour to drink a glass of wine with him (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) declined doing him (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) that honour; observing that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) never drank more than one glass of wine at dinner, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had just taken one with Mr Percival. Her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) manner was well-bred, but haughty in the extreme; and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was so passionate, that her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) anger sometimes conquered even her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) politeness. Her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) dislike to Clarence Hervey was apparent, even in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) silence. <div class="bookquote">``If the old gentlewoman has taken an antipathy to me at first sight, I cannot help it,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) went on to the beasts. The boy, who sat next him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), had asked some questions about the proboscis of the elephant, and Mr Hervey mentioned Ives's account of the elephants in India, who have been set to watch young children, and who draw them back gently with their trunks, when they go out of bounds. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) talked next of the unicorn; and addressing himself to Dr X-- and Mr Percival, he (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) declared that in his (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) opinion Herodotus did not deserve to be called the father of lies; he (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) cited the mammoth to prove that the apocryphal character in the history of beasts should not be contemned -- that it would in all probability be soon established as true history. The dessert was on the table before Clarence had done with the mammoth.

<p/>As the butler put a fine dish of cherries upon the table, he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``My lady, these cherries are a present from the old gardener to Miss Delacour.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Set them before Miss Delacour then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Anne/Lady Anne Percival/Percival</b></font>)</div>said Lady Anne. <div class="bookquote">``Helena, my dear, distribute your own cherries.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div><p/>At the name of Delacour, Clarence Hervey, though his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) head was still half full of the mammoth, looked round in astonishment; and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) saw the cherries placed before the young lady, whose resemblance to Lady Delacour he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) had before observed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) could not help exclaiming,

<p/>``That young lady then is not a daughter of your ladyship<div class="bookquote">``s?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; but I love her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) as well as if she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) were,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Anne/Lady Anne Percival/Percival</b></font>)</div>replied Lady Anne. -- <div class="bookquote">``What were you saying about the mammoth?''

 (<font color='red'><b>A niece</b></font>)</div><p/>``That the mammoth is supposed to be -- ' but interrupting himself, Clarence said in an inquiring tone -- ``A niece of Lady Delacour<div class="bookquote">``s?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) ladyship's daughter, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>said the severe old lady, in a voice more terrific than her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) looks.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Shall I give you some strawberries, Mr Hervey,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Anne/Lady Anne Percival/Percival</b></font>)</div>said Lady Anne, `or will you let Helena help you to some cherries?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) ladyship's daughter!''  (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Clarence Hervey in a tone of surprise.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Some cherries, sir?''  (<font color='red'><b>Helena/Miss Helena</b></font>)</div>said Helena; but her (<font color='blue'><b>Helena</b></font>) voice faltered so much, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Helena</b></font>) could hardly utter the words.

<p/>Clarence perceived that he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) had been the cause of her (<font color='blue'><b>Helena</b></font>) agitation, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) knew not precisely by what means; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) now applied himself in silence to the picking of his (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) strawberries with great diligence.

<p/>The ladies soon afterwards withdrew, and as Mr Percival did not touch upon the subject again, Clarence forbore to ask any further questions, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) was considerably surprised by this sudden discovery. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) went into the drawing-room to tea, he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) found his (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) friend, the stern old lady, speaking in a high declamatory tone. The words which he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) heard as he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) came into the room were --

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If there were no Clarence Herveys, there would be no Lady Delacours.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>-- Clarence bowed as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) had received a high compliment -- the old lady walked away to an antechamber, fanning herself with great energy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mrs Margaret Delacour,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Anne/Lady Anne Percival/Percival</b></font>)</div>said Lady Anne, in a low voice to Hervey, `is an aunt of Lord Delacour's. A woman whose heart is warmer than her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) temper.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And that is never cool,''  (<font color='red'><b>a lady</b></font>)</div>said a young lady, who sat next to Lady Anne. <div class="bookquote">``I call Mrs Margaret Delacour the volcano; I'm sure I am never in her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) company without dreading an eruption. Every now and then out comes with a tremendous noise, fire, smoke, and rubbish.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And precious minerals,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Anne/Lady Anne Percival/Percival</b></font>)</div>said Lady Anne, `amongst the rubbish.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But the best of it is,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>continued the young lady, `that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) is seldom in a passion without making a hundred mistakes, for which she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) is usually obliged afterwards to ask a thousand pardons.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``By that account,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Anne/Lady Anne Percival/Percival</b></font>)</div>said Lady Anne, `which I believe to be just, her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) contrition is always ten times as great as her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) offence.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now you talk of contrition, Lady Anne,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div>said Mr Hervey, <div class="bookquote">``I should think of my own offences: I am very sorry that my indiscreet questions gave Miss Delacour any pain -- my head was so full of the mammoth, that I blundered on without seeing what I was about till it was too late.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pray, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Delacour/Mrs Margaret Delacour/Margaret</b></font>)</div>said Mrs Margaret Delacour, who now returned, and took her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) seat upon a sofa, with the solemnity of a person who was going to sit in judgment upon a criminal, `pray, sir, may I ask how long you have been acquainted with my Lady Delacour?''

<p/>Clarence Hervey took up a book, and with great gravity kissed it, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) had been upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) oath in a court of justice, and answered,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``To the best of my recollection, madam, it is now four years since I had first the pleasure and honour of seeing Lady Delacour.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And in that time, intimately as you have had the pleasure of being acquainted with her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) ladyship, you have never discovered that she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) had a daughter?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div>said Mr Hervey.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There, Lady Anne! -- There!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Delacour/Mrs Margaret Delacour/Margaret</b></font>)</div>cried Mrs Delacour, `will you tell me after this, that Lady Delacour is not a monster?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Every body says that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)'s a prodigy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Anne/Lady Anne Percival/Percival</b></font>)</div>said Lady Anne; `and prodigies and monsters are sometimes thought synonymous terms.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Such a mother was never heard of,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Delacour/Mrs Margaret Delacour/Margaret</b></font>)</div>continued Mrs Delacour, `since the days of Savage and Lady Macclesfield. I am convinced that she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) hates her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) daughter. Why she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) never speaks of her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) -- she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) never sees her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) -- she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) never thinks of her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>)!''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Some mothers speak more than they think of their children, and others think more than they speak of them,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Anne/Lady Anne Percival/Percival</b></font>)</div>said Lady Anne.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I always thought,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div>said Mr Hervey, `that Lady Delacour was a woman of great sensibility.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sensibility!''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>exclaimed the indignant old lady, `she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) has no sensibility, sir -- none -- none. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) who lives in a constant round of dissipation, who performs no one duty, who exists only for herself, how does she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) show her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) sensibility? -- Has she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) sensibility for her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) husband -- for her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) daughter -- for any one useful purpose upon earth? -- Oh, how I hate the cambric handkerchief sensibility that is brought out only to weep at a tragedy! -- Yes; Lady Delacour has sensibility enough, I grant ye, when sensibility is the fashion. I remember well her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) performing the part of a nurse with vast applause; and I remember, too, the sensibility she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) showed, when the child that she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) nursed fell a sacrifice to her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) dissipation. The second of her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) children, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) killed -- '

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Killed! -- Oh! surely, my dear Mrs Delacour, that is too strong a word,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said Lady Anne: `you would not make a Medea of Lady Delacour!''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It would have been better if I had,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Delacour/Mrs Margaret Delacour/Margaret</b></font>)</div>cried Mrs Delacour. <div class="bookquote">``I can understand that there may be such a thing in nature as a jealous wife, but an unfeeling mother I cannot comprehend -- that passes my powers of imagination.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And mine, so much,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Anne/Lady Anne Percival/Percival</b></font>)</div>said Lady Anne, `that I cannot believe such a being to exist in the world -- notwithstanding all the descriptions I have heard of it: as you say, my dear Mrs Delacour, it passes my powers of imagination. Let us leave it in Mr Hervey's apocryphal chapter of animals, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) will excuse us if I never admit it into true history, at least without some better evidence than I have yet heard.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, my dear, dear Lady Anne,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Delacour/Mrs Margaret Delacour/Margaret</b></font>)</div>cried Mrs Delacour -- `bless me, I've made this coffee so sweet, there's no drinking it -- what evidence would you have?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``None,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Anne/Lady Anne Percival/Percival</b></font>)</div>said Lady Anne, smiling, <div class="bookquote">``I would have none.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Anne/Lady Anne Percival/Percival</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is to say, you will take none,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Delacour/Mrs Margaret Delacour/Margaret</b></font>)</div>said Mrs Delacour: `but can any thing be stronger evidence than her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) ladyship's conduct to my poor Helen -- to your Helen, I should say -- for you have educated, you have protected her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>), you have been a mother to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). I am an infirm, weak, ignorant, passionate old woman -- I could not have been what you have been to that child -- God bless you! -- God will bless you!''

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) rose as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) spoke, to set down her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) coffee-cup on the table. Clarence Hervey took it from her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) with a look which said much, and which she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was perfectly capable of understanding.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Young man,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), `it is very unfashionable to treat age and infirmity with politeness. I wish that your friend, Lady Delacour, may at my time of life meet with as much respect, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) has met with admiration and gallantry in her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) youth. Poor woman, her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) head has absolutely been turned with admiration -- and if fame say true, Mr Hervey has had his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) share in turning that head by his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) flattery.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sure her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) ladyship has turned mine by her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) charms,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div>said Clarence; `and I certainly am not to be blamed for admiring what all the world admires.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>said the old lady, `for her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) own sake, for the sake of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) family, and for the sake of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) reputation, that my Lady Delacour had fewer admirers, and more friends.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Women who have met with so many admirers, seldom meet with many friends,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Anne/Lady Anne Percival/Percival</b></font>)</div>said Lady Anne.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Delacour/Mrs Margaret Delacour/Margaret</b></font>)</div>said Mrs Delacour, `for they seldom are wise enough to know their value.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We learn the value of all things, but especially of friends, by experience,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Anne/Lady Anne Percival/Percival</b></font>)</div>said Lady Anne; `and it is no wonder, therefore, that those who have little experience of the pleasures of friendship should not be wise enough to know their value.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This is very good-natured sophistry; but Lady Delacour is too vain ever to have a friend,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Delacour/Mrs Margaret Delacour/Margaret</b></font>)</div>said Mrs Delacour. <div class="bookquote">``My dear Lady Anne, you don't know her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) as well as I do -- she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) has more vanity than ever woman had.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is certainly saying a great deal,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Anne/Lady Anne Percival/Percival</b></font>)</div>said Lady Anne; `but then we must consider, that Lady Delacour, as an heiress, a beauty, and a wit, has a right to a triple share at least.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Both her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) fortune and her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) beauty are gone; and if she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had any wit left, it is time it should teach her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) how to conduct herself, I think,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Delacour/Mrs Margaret Delacour/Margaret</b></font>)</div>said Mrs Delacour: `but I give her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) up -- I give her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) up.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, no,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Anne/Lady Anne Percival/Percival</b></font>)</div>said Lady Anne, `you must not give her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) up yet, I have been informed, and upon the best authority, that Lady Delacour was not always the unfeeling, dissipated fine lady that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) now appears to be. This is only one of the transformations of fashion -- the period of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) enchantment will soon be at an end, and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) will return to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) natural character. I should not be at all surprised, if Lady Delacour were to appear at once la femme comme il y en a peu.''

<p/>``Or la bonne mère? ' said Mrs Delacour, sarcastically, `after thus leaving her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) daughter -- '

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Pour bonne bouche,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Anne/Lady Anne Percival/Percival</b></font>)</div>interrupted Lady Anne, `when she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) is tired of the insipid taste of other pleasures, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) will have a higher relish for those of domestic life, which will be new and fresh to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>).''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And so you really think, my dear Lady Anne, that my Lady Delacour will end by being a domestic woman. Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Delacour/Mrs Margaret Delacour/Margaret</b></font>)</div>said Mrs Margaret, after taking two pinches of snuff, `some people believe in the millennium; but I confess I am not one of them -- are you, Mr Hervey?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If it were foretold to me by a good angel,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div>said Clarence, smiling, as his (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) eye glanced at Lady Anne; `if it were foretold to me by a good angel, how could I doubt it?''

<p/>Here the conversation was interrupted by the entrance of one of Lady Anne's little boys, who came running eagerly up to his (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) mother, to ask whether he (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) might have `the sulphurs to show to Helena Delacour. I want to show her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) Vertumnus and Pomona, mamma,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Were not the cherries that the old gardener sent very good?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What is this about the cherries and the old gardener, Charles?''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>said the young lady who sat beside Lady Anne: `come here and tell me the whole story.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I will, but I should tell it you a great deal better another time,''  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div>said the boy, `because now Helena's waiting for Vertumnus and Pomona.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Go then to Helena,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Anne/Lady Anne Percival/Percival</b></font>)</div>said Lady Anne, `and I will tell the story for you.''

<p/>Then turning to the young lady she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) began -- <div class="bookquote">``Once upon a time there lived an old gardener at Kensington; and this old gardener had an aloe, which was older than himself; for it was very near a hundred years of age, and it was just going to blossom, and the old gardener calculated how much he (<font color='blue'><b>gardener</b></font>) might make by showing his (<font color='blue'><b>gardener</b></font>) aloe, when it should be in full blow, to the generous public -- and he (<font color='blue'><b>gardener</b></font>) calculated that he (<font color='blue'><b>gardener</b></font>) might make a 100l.; and with this 100l. he (<font color='blue'><b>gardener</b></font>) determined to do more than was ever done with a 100l. before: but, unluckily, as he (<font color='blue'><b>gardener</b></font>) was thus reckoning his (<font color='blue'><b>gardener</b></font>) blossoms before they were blown, he (<font color='blue'><b>gardener</b></font>) chanced to meet with a fair damsel, who ruined all his (<font color='blue'><b>gardener</b></font>) calculations.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, Mrs Stanhope's maid, was not it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Delacour/Mrs Margaret Delacour/Margaret</b></font>)</div>interrupted Mrs Margaret Delacour. <div class="bookquote">``A pretty damsel she (<font color='blue'><b>damsel</b></font>) was, and almost as good a politician as her (<font color='blue'><b>damsel</b></font>) mistress. Think of that jilt's tricking this poor old fellow out of his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) aloe, and -- oh, the meanness of Lady Delacour, to accept of that aloe for one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) extravagant entertainments!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I always understood that she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) paid fifty guineas for it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Anne/Lady Anne Percival/Percival</b></font>)</div>said Lady Anne.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) did or not,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Delacour/Mrs Margaret Delacour/Margaret</b></font>)</div>said Mrs Delacour, `her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) ladyship and Mrs Stanhope between them were the ruin of this poor old man. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was taken in to marry that jade of a waiting-maid; she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) turned out just as you might expect from a pupil of Mrs Stanhope's -- the match-making Mrs Stanhope -- you know, sir.'' -LRB-Clarence Hervey changed colour.-RRB- ``She (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) turned out,<div class="bookquote">'' continued Mrs Delacour, `every thing that was bad -- ruined her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) husband -- ran away from him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) -- and left him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) a beggar.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Poor man!''  (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div>said Clarence Hervey.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Anne/Lady Anne Percival/Percival</b></font>)</div>said Lady Anne, `let's come to the best part of the story -- mark how good comes out of evil. If this poor man had not lost his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) aloe and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife, I probably should never have been acquainted with Mrs Delacour, or with my little Helena. About the time that the old gardener was left a beggar, as I happened to be walking one fine evening in Sloane-street, I met a procession of school-girls -- an old man begged from them in a most moving voice; and as they passed, several of the young ladies threw halfpence to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). One little girl, who observed that the old man could not stoop without great difficulty, stayed behind the rest of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) companions, and collected the halfpence which they had thrown to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and put them into his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hat. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) began to tell his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) story over again to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) stayed so long listening to it, that her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) companions had turned the corner of the street, and were out of sight. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) looked about in great distress; and I never shall forget the pathetic voice with which she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Oh! what will become of me? every body will be angry with me.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>I assured her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) that nobody should be angry with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) gave me her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) little hand with the utmost innocent confidence. I took her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) home to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) schoolmistress, and I was so pleased with the beginning of this acquaintance, that I was determined to cultivate it. One good acquaintance I have heard always leads to another. Helena introduced me to her (<font color='blue'><b>Helena</b></font>) aunt Delacour as her (<font color='blue'><b>Helena</b></font>) best friend. Mrs Margaret Delacour has had the goodness to let her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) little niece spend the holidays and all her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) leisure time with me, so that our acquaintance has grown into friendship. Helena has become quite one of my family.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And I am sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) has become quite a different creature since she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) has been so much with you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Delacour/Mrs Margaret Delacour/Margaret</b></font>)</div>cried Mrs Delacour; `her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) spirits were quite broken by her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) mother's neglect of her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>): young as she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) is, she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) has a great deal of real sensibility; but as to her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) mother's sensibility -- '

<p/>At the recollection of Lady Delacour's neglect of her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) child, Mrs Delacour was going again to launch forth into indignant invective, but Lady Anne stopped her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>), by whispering --

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Take care what you say of the mother, for here is the daughter coming, and she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) has, indeed a great deal of real sensibility.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>Helena and her (<font color='blue'><b>Helena</b></font>) young companions now came into the room, bringing with them the sulphurs at which they had been looking.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mamma,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charles/Charles Percival</b></font>)</div>said young Charles Percival, `we have brought the sulphurs to you, because there are some of them that I don't know.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Wonderful!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Anne/Lady Anne Percival/Percival</b></font>)</div>said Lady Anne; `and what is not quite so wonderful, there are some of them that I don't know.''

<p/>The children spread the sulfurs upon a little table, and all the company gathered round it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here are all the nine muses for you,''  (<font color='red'><b>the boys</b></font>)</div>said the least of the boys, who had taken his (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) seat by Clarence Hervey at dinner; `here are all the muses for you, Mr Hervey: which do you like best? -- Oh, that's the tragic muse that you have chosen! -- You don't like the tragic better than the comic muse, do you?''

<p/>Clarence Hervey made no answer, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) was at that instant recollecting how Belinda looked in the character of the tragic muse.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Has your ladyship ever happened to meet with the young lady who has spent this winter with Lady Delacour?''  (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div>said Clarence to Lady Anne.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I sat near her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) one night at the opera,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Anne/Lady Anne Percival/Percival</b></font>)</div>said Lady Anne: `she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) has a charming countenance.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who? -- Belinda Portman, do you mean?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Delacour/Mrs Margaret Delacour/Margaret</b></font>)</div>said Mrs Delacour. <div class="bookquote">``I am sure if I were a young man, I would not trust to the charming countenance of a young lady who is a pupil of Mrs Stanhope's, and a friend of -- Helena, my dear, shut the door -- the most dissipated woman in London.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Anne/Lady Anne Percival/Percival</b></font>)</div>said Lady Anne, <div class="bookquote">``Miss Portman is in a dangerous situation; but some young people learn prudence by being placed in dangerous situations, as some young horses, I have heard Mr Percival say, learn to be sure-footed, by being left to pick their own way on bad roads.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Anne/Lady Anne Percival/Percival</b></font>)</div><p/>Here Mr Percival, Dr X--, and some other gentlemen, came up stairs to tea, and the conversation took another turn. Clarence Hervey endeavoured to take his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) share in it with his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) usual vivacity, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) was thinking of Belinda Portman, dangerous situations, stumbling horses, &c.; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) made several blunders, which showed his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) absence of mind.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What have you there, Mr Hervey?''  (<font color='red'><b>Dr</b></font>)</div>said Dr X--, looking over his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) shoulder -- `the tragic muse? This tragic muse seems to rival Lady Delacour in your admiration.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div>said Clarence, smiling, `you know I was always a votary of the muses.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And a favoured votary,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dr</b></font>)</div>said Dr X--. <div class="bookquote">``I wish for the interests of literature, that poets may always be lovers, though I cannot say that I desire lovers should always be poets. But, Mr Hervey, you must never marry, remember,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dr</b></font>)</div>continued Dr X--, `never -- for your true poet must always be miserable. You know Petrarch tells us, he (<font color='blue'><b>poet</b></font>) would not have been happy if he (<font color='blue'><b>poet</b></font>) could: he (<font color='blue'><b>poet</b></font>) would not have married his (<font color='blue'><b>poet</b></font>) mistress if it had been in his (<font color='blue'><b>poet</b></font>) power; because then there would have been an end of his (<font color='blue'><b>poet</b></font>) beautiful sonnets.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Every one to his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) taste,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div>said Clarence; `for my part I have even less ambition to imitate the heroism than hope of being inspired with the poetic genius of Petrarch. I have no wish to pass whole nights composing sonnets. I would -LRB-am I not right, Mr Percival?-RRB- infinitely rather be a slave of the ring than a slave of the lamp.''

<p/>Here the conversation ended; Clarence took his (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) leave, and Mrs Margaret Delacour said, the moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) had left the room, <div class="bookquote">``Quite a different sort of young man from what I had expected to see!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER IX

<p/>Advice

<p/>THE next morning Mr Hervey called on Dr X--, and begged that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) would accompany him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) to Lady Delacour's.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``To be introduced to your tragic muse?''  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>said the doctor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div>said Mr Hervey: <div class="bookquote">``I must have your opinion of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) before I devote myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My opinion! but of whom? -- Of Lady Delacour?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; but of a young lady whom you will see with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) handsome?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Beautiful!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And young?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And young.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And graceful?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The most graceful person you ever beheld.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Young, beautiful, graceful; then the deuce take me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dr</b></font>)</div>said Dr X--, `if I give you my opinion of her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>), for the odds are, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) has a thousand faults, at least, to balance these perfections.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A thousand faults! a charitable allowance,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div>said Clarence, smiling.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dr</b></font>)</div>said Dr X--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Touch him (<font color='blue'><b>Young</b></font>), and no minister's so sore.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dr</b></font>)</div>To punish you for wincing at my first setting out, I promise you, that if the lady have a million of faults, each of them high as huge Olympus, I will see them as with the eye of a flatterer -- not of a friend.''
``I defy you to be so good or so bad as your word, doctor,'' said Hervey. <div class="bookquote">``You have too much wit to make a good flatterer.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And perhaps you think too much to make a good friend,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dr</b></font>)</div>said Dr X--.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div>said Clarence: <div class="bookquote">``I would at any time rather be cut by a sharp knife than by a blunt one. But, my dear doctor, I hope you will not be prejudiced against Belinda, merely because she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) is with Lady Delacour; for to my certain knowledge, she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) is not under her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) ladyship's influence. She (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) judges and acts for herself, of which I have had an instance.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very possibly!''  (<font color='red'><b>Dr</b></font>)</div>interrupted Dr X--. <div class="bookquote">``But before we go any farther, will you please tell me of what Belinda you are talking?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Belinda Portman. I forgot that I had not told you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Miss Portman, a niece of Mrs Stanhope<div class="bookquote">``s?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, but do not be prejudiced against her (<font color='blue'><b>Stanhope</b></font>) on that account.''  (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div>said Clarence, eagerly, `though I was at first myself.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then you will excuse my following your example instead of your precepts.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div>said Clarence, `for my precepts are far better than my example.''

<p/>Lady Delacour received Dr X-- most courteously, and thanked Mr Hervey for introducing her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) to a gentleman with whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) had long desired to converse. Dr X-- had a great literary reputation, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) saw that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) was a perfectly well-bred man; consequently she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) was ambitious of winning his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) admiration. She (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) perceived also that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) had considerable influence with Clarence Hervey, and this was a sufficient reason to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) wish for his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) good opinion. Belinda was particularly pleased with his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) manners and conversation; she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) saw that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) paid her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) much attention, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) was desirous that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) should think favourably of her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>); but she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) had the good sense and good taste to avoid a display of her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) abilities and accomplishments. A sensible man, who has any knowledge of the world and talents for conversation, can easily draw out the knowledge of those with whom he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) converses. Dr X-- possessed this power in a superior degree.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div>cried Clarence, when their visit was over, `what is your opinion of Lady Delacour?''

<p/>``I am <div class="bookquote">``blasted with excess of light,'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>' said the doctor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Her (<font color='blue'><b>Stanhope</b></font>) ladyship is certainly very brilliant,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div>said Clarence, `but I hope that Miss Portman did not overpower you.''

<p/>``No -- I turned my eyes from Lady Delacour upon Miss Portman, as a painter turns his (<font color='blue'><b>painter</b></font>) eyes upon mild green, to rest them, when they have been dazzled by glaring colours.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) yields her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) charms of mind with sweet delay.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'
<div class="bookquote">``I was afraid,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div>said Hervey, `that you might think her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) manners too reserved and cold: they are certainly become more so than they used to be. But so much the better, by and by we shall find beautiful flowers spring up from beneath the snow.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A very poetic hope,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dr</b></font>)</div>said Dr X--; `but in judging of the human character, we must not entirely trust to analogies and allusions taken from vegetable creation.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What!''  (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div>cried Clarence Hervey, looking eagerly in the doctor's eyes, `what do you mean? I am afraid you do not approve of Belinda.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your fears are almost as precipitate as your hopes, my good sir: but to put you out of pain, I will tell you, that I approve of all I have seen of this young lady, but that it is absolutely out of my power to form a decisive judgment of a woman's temper and character in the course of a single morning visit. Women, you know, as well as men, often speak with one species of enthusiasm, and act with another. I must see your Belinda act, I must study her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>), before I can give you my final judgment. Lady Delacour has honoured me with her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) commands to go to her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) as often as possible. For your sake, my dear Hervey, I shall obey her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) ladyship most punctually, that I may have frequent opportunities of seeing your Miss Portman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div><p/>Clarence expressed his (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) gratitude with much energy, for this instance of the doctor's friendship. Belinda, who had been entertained by Dr X--'s conversation during this first visit, was more and more delighted with his (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) company as she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) became more acquainted with his (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) understanding and character. She (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) unfolded her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) powers, and that with the greatest politeness and address he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) raised her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) confidence in herself, without ever descending to flattery. By degrees she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) learned to look upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) as a friend; she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) imparted to him (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) with great ingenuousness her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) opinions on various subjects, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) was both amused and instructed by his (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) observations on the characters and manners of the company who frequented Lady Delacour's assemblies. She (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) did not judge of the doctor's sincerity merely by the kindness he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) showed her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>), but by his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) conduct towards others.

<p/>One night, at a select party at Lady Delacour's, a Spanish gentleman was amusing the company with some anecdotes, to prove the extraordinary passion which some of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) countrymen formerly showed for the game of chess. He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) mentioned families, in which unfinished games, bequeathed by will, had descended from father to son, and where victory was doubtful for upwards of a century.

<p/>Mr Hervey observed, that gaining a battle was, at that time, so common to the court of Spain, that a victory at chess seemed to confer more éclat; for that an abbé, by losing adroitly a game at chess to the Spanish minister, obtained a cardinal's hat.

<p/>The foreigner was flattered by the manner in which Hervey introduced this slight circumstance, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) directed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) conversation, speaking in French and Italian successively; he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) was sufficiently skilled in both languages, but Clarence spoke them better. Till he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) appeared, the foreigner was the principal object of attention, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) was soon eclipsed by Mr Hervey. Nothing amusing or instructive that could be said upon the game of chess escaped him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>), and the literary ground, which the slow Don would have taken some hours to go regularly over, our hero traversed in a few minutes. From Twiss to Vida, from Irwin to Sir William Jones, from Spain to India, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) passed with admirable celerity, and seized all that could adorn his (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) course from Indian Antiquities of Asiatic Researches.

<p/>By this display of knowledge he (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) surprised even his (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) friend Dr X--. The ladies admired his (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) taste as a poet, the gentlemen his (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) accuracy as a critic; Lady Delacour loudly applauded, and Belinda silently approved. Clarence was elated. The Spanish gentleman, to whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) had just quoted a case in point from Vida's Scacchia, asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) were as perfect in the practice as in the theory of the game. Clarence was too proud of excelling in every thing to decline the Spaniard's challenge. They sat down to chess. Lady Delacour, as they ranged the pieces on the board, cried, <div class="bookquote">``Whoever wins shall be my knight; and a silver chess-man shall be his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) prize. Was it not Queen Elizabeth who gave a silver chess-man to one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) courtiers as a mark of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) royal favour? I am ashamed to imitate such a pedantic coquet -- but since I have said it, how can I retract?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Impossible! impossible!''  (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div>cried Clarence Hervey: 'a silver chess-man be our prize; and if I win it, like the gallant Raleigh, I will wear it in my cap; and what proud Essex shall dare to challenge it?''

<p/>The combat now began -- the spectators were silent. Clarence made an error in his (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) first move, for his (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) attention was distracted by seeing Belinda behind his (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) adversary's chair. The Spaniard was deceived by this mistake into a contemptuous opinion of his (<font color='blue'><b>Spaniard</b></font>) opponent -- Belinda changed her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) place -- Clarence recovered his (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) presence of mind, and convinced him (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) was not a man to be despised. The combat was long doubtful, but at length to the surprise of all present, Clarence Hervey was victorious.

<p/>Exulting in his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) success, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) looked round for Lady Delacour, from whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) expected the honours of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) triumph. She (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) had left the room, but soon she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) returned, dressed in the character of Queen Elizabeth, in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) had once appeared at a masquerade, with a large ruff, and all the costume of the times.

<p/>Clarence Hervey, throwing himself at her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) feet, addressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) in that high-flown style which her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) majesty was wont to hear from the gallant Raleigh, or the accomplished Essex.

<p/>Soon the coquetry of the queen entirely conquered her (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) prudery; and the favoured courtier, evidently elated by his (<font color='blue'><b>courtier</b></font>) situation, was as enthusiastic as her (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) majesty's most insatiable vanity could desire. The characters were well supported; both the actor and actress were highly animated, and seemed so fully possessed by their parts as to be insensible to the comments that were made upon the scene. Clarence Hervey was first recalled to himself by the deep blush which he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) saw on Belinda's cheek, when Queen Elizabeth addressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) as one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) maids of honour, of whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) affected to be jealous. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) was conscious that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) had been hurried by the enthusiasm of the moment farther then he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) either wished or intended. It was difficult to recede, when her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) majesty seemed disposed to advance; but Sir Walter Raleigh, with much presence of mind, turned to the foreigner, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>foreigner</b></font>) accosted as the Spanish ambassador.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your excellency sees,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>foreigner</b></font>), `how this great queen turns the heads of her (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) faithful subjects, and afterwards has the art of paying them with nothing but words. Has the new world afforded you any coin half so valuable?''

<p/>The Spanish gentleman's grave replies to this playful question gave a new turn to the conversation, and relieved Clarence Hervey from his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) embarrassment. Lady Delacour, though still in high spirits, was easily diverted to other objects. She (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) took the Spaniard with her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) to the next room, to show him (<font color='blue'><b>Spaniard</b></font>) a picture of Mary, Queen of Scots. The company followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) -- Clarence Hervey remained with Dr X-- and Belinda, who had just asked the doctor, to teach her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) the moves at chess.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Lady Delacour has charming spirits,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div>said Clarence Hervey; `they inspire every body with gaiety.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Every body! They incline me more to melancholy than mirth,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dr</b></font>)</div>said Dr X--. <div class="bookquote">``These high spirits do not seem quite natural. The vivacity of youth and of health, Miss Portman, always charms me; but this gaiety of Lady Delacour's does not appear to me that of a sound mind in a sound body.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The doctor</b></font>)</div><p/>The doctor's penetration went so near the truth, that Belinda, afraid of betraying her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) friend's secret, never raised her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) eyes from the chess-board whilst he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) spoke, but went on setting up the fallen castles, and bishops, and kings, with expeditious diligence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are putting the bishop into the place of the knight,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div>said Clarence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Lady Delacour,''  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>continued the doctor, `seems to be in a perpetual fever, either of mind or body -- I cannot tell which -- and as a professional man, I really have some curiosity to determine the question. If I could feel her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) pulse, I could instantly decide; but I have heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) say that she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) has a horror against having her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) pulse felt, and a lady's horror is invincible, by reason -- '

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But not by address,''  (<font color='red'><b>a lady</b></font>)</div>said Clarence. <div class="bookquote">``I can tell you a method of counting her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) pulse, without her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) knowing it, without her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) seeing you, without your seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed!''  (<font color='red'><b>Said</b></font>)</div>Said Dr X--, smiling; `that may be a useful secret in my profession; pray impart it to me -- you who excel in every thing.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you in earnest, Mr Hervey?''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Belinda.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Perfectly in earnest -- my secret is quite simple. Look through the door at the shadow of Queen Elizabeth's ruff -- observe how it vibrates; the motion as well as the figure is magnified in the shadow. Cannot you count every pulsation distinctly?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dr</b></font>)</div>said Dr X--, `and I give you credit for making an ingenious use of a trifling observation.'' The doctor paused and looked around. <div class="bookquote">``Those people cannot hear what we are saying, I believe?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, no,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Belinda, `they are intent upon themselves.''

<p/>Doctor X-- fixed his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) eyes mildly upon Clarence Hervey, and exclaimed in an earnest friendly tone -- <div class="bookquote">``What a pity, Mr Hervey, that a young man of your talents and acquirements, a man who might be any thing, should -- pardon the expression -- choose to be -- nothing; should waste upon petty objects powers suited to the greatest; should lend his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) soul to every contest for frivolous superiority; when the same energy concentrated might ensure honourable pre-eminence among the first men in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) country. Shall he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) who might not only distinguish himself in any science or situation, who might not only acquire personal fame, but, oh, far more noble motive! who might be permanently useful to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fellow-creatures, content himself with being the evanescent amusement of a drawing-room? -- Shall one, who might be great in public, or happy in private life, waste in this deplorable manner the best years of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) existence -- time that can never be recalled? -- This is declamation! -- No: it is truth put into the strongest language that I have power to use, in the hope of making some impression: I speak from my heart, for I have a sincere regard for you, Mr Hervey, and if I have been impertinent, you must forgive me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Forgive you!''  (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div>cried Clarence Hervey, taking Dr X-- by the hand, <div class="bookquote">``I think you a real friend; you shall have the best thanks not in words, but in actions: you have roused my ambition, and I will pursue noble ends by noble means. A few years have been sacrificed; but the lessons that they have taught me remain. I cannot, presumptuous as I am, flatter myself that my exertions can be of any material utility to my fellow-creatures, but what I can I will, my excellent friend! If I be hereafter either successful in public, or happy in private life, it is to you I shall owe it.''  (<font color='red'><b>Dr</b></font>)</div>Belinda was touched by the candour and good sense with which Clarence Hervey spoke. His (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) character appeared in a new light: she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) was proud of her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) own judgment, in having discerned his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) merit, and for a moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) permitted herself to feel `unreproved pleasure in his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) company.''

<p/>The next morning, Sir Philip Baddely and Mr Rochfort called at Lady Delacour's -- Mr Hervey was present -- her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) ladyship was summoned to Mrs Franks, and Belinda was left with these gentlemen.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, damme, Clary! You have been a lost man,''  (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Philip Baddely</b></font>)</div>cried Sir Philip, `ever since you were drowned. Damme, why did not you come to dine with us that day, now I recollect it? We were all famously merry; but for your comfort, Clarence, we missed you cursedly, and were damned sorry you ever took that unlucky jump into the Serpentine river -- damned sorry, were not we, Rochfort?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div>said Clarence, in an ironical tone, `you need no vouchers to convince me of the reality of your sorrow. You know I can never forget your jumping so courageously into the river, to save the life of your friend.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, pooh! Damn it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Philip Baddely</b></font>)</div>said Sir Philip, `what signifies who pulled you out, now you are safe and sound? By-the-bye, Clary, did you ever quiz that doctor, as I desired you? No, that I'm sure you didn't; but I think he (<font color='blue'><b>Clary</b></font>) has made a quiz of you: for, damme, I believe you have taken such a fancy to the old quizzical fellow, that you can't live without him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>). Miss Portman, don't you admire Hervey's taste?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``On this instance I certainly do admire Mr Hervey's taste,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Belinda, `for the best of all possible reasons, because it entirely agrees with my own.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very extraordinary, faith,''  (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Philip Baddely</b></font>)</div>said Sir Philip.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And what the devil can you find to like in him (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>), Clary?''  (<font color='red'><b>Rochfort/Mr Rochfort</b></font>)</div>continued Mr Rochfort, `for one wouldn't be so rude to put the question to a lady. Ladies, you know, are never to be questioned about their likings and dislikings. Some have pet dogs, some have pet cats; then why not a pet quiz? '

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ha! ha! ha! that's a good one, Rochfort -- a pet quiz -- Ha! ha! ha! Dr X-- shall be Miss Portman's pet quiz. Put it about, put it about, Rochfort,''  (<font color='red'><b>the baronet</b></font>)</div>continued the witty baronet, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochfort</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochfort</b></font>) facetious companion continued to laugh as long as they possibly could at this happy hit.

<p/>Belinda, without being in the least discomposed by their insolent folly, as soon as they had finished laughing, very coolly observed, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) could have no objection to give her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) reasons for preferring Dr X--'s company but for fear they might give offense to Sit Philip and his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) friends. She (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) then defended the doctor with so much firmness, and yet with so much propriety, that Clarence Hervey was absolutely enchanted with her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>), and with his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) own penetration in having discovered her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) real character, notwithstanding her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) being Mrs Stanhope's niece.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I never argue, for my part,''  (<font color='red'><b>Rochfort/Mr Rochfort</b></font>)</div>cried Mr Rochfort, <div class="bookquote">''pon honour, `tis a deal too much trouble. A lady, a handsome lady, I mean, is always in the right with me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Rochfort/Mr Rochfort</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But as to you, Hervey, `said Sir Philip, `damme, do you know, my boy, that our club has come to a determination to black-ball you, if you keep company with this famous doctor?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Your club, Sir Philip, will do me honour by such an ostracism.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ostracism!''  (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Philip Baddely</b></font>)</div>repeated Sir Philip. -- <div class="bookquote">``In plain English, does that mean that you choose to be black-balled by us? Why, damn it, Clary, you'll be nobody. But follow your own genius -- damn me, if I take it upon me to understand your men of genius -- they are in the Serpentine river one day, and in the clouds the next: so fare ye well, Clary. I expect to see you a doctor of physic, or a methodist parson, soon, damn me if I don't: so fare ye well, Clary. Is black-ball your last word? or will you think better on't, and give up the doctor?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can never give up Dr X--'s friendship -- I would sooner be black-balled by every club in London. The good lesson you gave me, Sir Philip, the day I was fool enough to jump into the Serpentine river, has made me wiser for life. I know, for I have felt, the difference between real friends and fashionable acquaintance. Give up Dr X--! Never! never!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then fare ye well, Clary, `said Sir Philip, `you're no longer one of us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then fare ye well, Clary, you're no longer the man for me.''  (<font color='red'><b>Rochfort/Mr Rochfort</b></font>)</div>said Rochfort.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tant pis, and tant mieux,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div>said Clarence, and so they parted.

<p/>As they left the room, Clarence Hervey involuntarily turned to Belinda, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) thought that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) read in her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) ingenuous, animated countenance, full approbation of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) conduct.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hist! are they gone? quite gone?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>said Lady Delacour, entering the room from an adjoining apartment; `they have stayed an unconscionable time. How much I am obliged to Mrs Franks for detaining me! I have escaped their vapid impertinence; and in truth, this morning I have such a multiplicity of business, that I have scarcely a moment even for wit and Clarence Hervey. Belinda, my dear, will you have the charity to look over some of these letters for me, which, as Marriott tells, me, have been lying in my writing-table this week -- expecting, most unreasonably, that I should have the grace to open them? We are always punished for our indolence, as your friend Dr X-- said the other day: if we suffer business to accumulate, it drifts with every ill wind like snow, till at last an avalanche of it comes down at once, and quite overwhelms us. Excuse me, Clarence,<div class="bookquote">'' continued her (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) ladyship, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) opened her (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) letters, `this is very rude: but I know I have secured my pardon from you by remembering your friend's wit -- wisdom, I should say: how seldom are wit and wisdom joined! They might have been joined in Lady Delacour, perhaps -- there's vanity! -- if she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) had early met with such a friend as Dr X--; but it's too late now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>), with a deep sigh.

<p/>Clarence Hervey heard it, and it made a great impression upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) benevolent imagination. <div class="bookquote">``Why too late?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) to himself. <div class="bookquote">``Mrs Margaret Delacour is mistaken, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) thinks this woman wants sensibility.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What have you got there, Miss Portman?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>said Lady Delacour, taking from Belinda's hand one of the letters which she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) had begged her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) to look over: `something wondrous pathetic, I should guess, by your countenance. <div class="bookquote">``Helena Delacour.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Oh! read it to yourself, my dear -- a school-girl's letter is a thing I abominate -- I make it a rule never to read Helena's epistles.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let me prevail upon your ladyship to make an exception to the general rule then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Belinda; ``I can assure you this is not a common school-girl's letter: Miss Delacour seems to inherit her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) mother's <div class="bookquote">``eloquence de billet.''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>'

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Portman seems to possess, by inheritance, by instinct, by magic, or otherwise, powers of persuasion, which no one can resist. There's compliment for compliment, my dear. Is there any thing half so well turned in Helena's letter? Really, `tis vastly well,''  (<font color='red'><b>ladyship</b></font>)</div>continued her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) ladyship, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) read the letter: `where did the little gipsy learn to write so charmingly? I protest I should like of all things to have her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) at home with me this summer -- the 21st of June -- well, after the birthday, I shall have time to think about it. But then, we shall be going out of town, and at Harrowgate I should not know what to do with her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>): she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) had better, much better, go to her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) humdrum Aunt Margaret's, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) always does -- she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) is a fixture in Grosvenor-square. These stationary good people, these zoophite friends, are sometimes very convenient; and Mrs Margaret Delacour is the most unexceptional zoophite in the creation. She (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) has, it is true, an antipathy to me, because I'm of such a different nature from herself; but then her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) antipathy does not extend to my offspring: she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) is kind beyond measure to Helena, on purpose, I believe, to provoke me. Now I provoke her (<font color='blue'><b>Helena</b></font>) in my turn, by never being provoked, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Helena</b></font>) saves me a vast deal of trouble, for which she (<font color='blue'><b>Helena</b></font>) is overpaid by the pleasure of abusing me. This is the way of the world, Clarence. Don't look so serious -- you are not come yet to daughters and sons, and schools and holidays, and all the evils of domestic life.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Evils!''  (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div>repeated Clarence Hervey, in a tone which surprised her (<font color='blue'><b>Helena</b></font>) ladyship.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pray, Lady Delacour, `interrupted Clarence Hervey, `when do you go to Harrowgate?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What a sudden transition!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>said Lady Delacour. <div class="bookquote">``What association of ideas could just at that instant take you to Harrowgate?

 (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div><p/>And soon after this arrangement was made, Mr Hervey took his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) leave.

<p/>``Well, my dear, are you pouring over that letter of Helena<div class="bookquote">``s?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Lady Delacour to Miss Portman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I fancy your ladyship did not quite finish it.''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Belinda.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No; I saw something about the Leverian Museum, and a swallow's nest in a pair of garden-shears; and I was afraid I was to have a catalogue of curiosities, for which I have little taste and less time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You did not see, then, what Miss Delacour says of the lady who took her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) to that Museum?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Because I hate to be like other people,''  (<font color='red'><b>ladyship</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) ladyship, `who delight in making themselves appear better than they are.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Surely, your ladyship does not think,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Belinda, `that a wife is a being whose actions are necessarily governed by a husband.''

<p/>``Not necessarily -- but accidentally. When a lady accidentally sets up for being a good wife, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) must of course love, honour, and obey. Now, you understand, I am not in the least obliged to Lady Anne for her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) kindness to Helena, because it all goes under the head of obedience, in my imagination; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) ladyship is paid for it by an accession of character: she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) has the reward of having it said, ``Oh, Lady Anne Percival is the best wife in the world!'' -- ``Oh, Lady Anne Percival is quite a pattern woman!<div class="bookquote">'' I hate pattern women. I hope I may never see Lady Anne; for I'm sure I should detest her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) beyond all things living -- Mrs Luttridge not excepted.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Percival a pattern woman</b></font>)</div><p/>Belinda was surprised and shocked at the malignant vehemence with which her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) ladyship uttered these words; it was in vain, however, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) remonstrated on the injustice of predetermining to detest Lady Anne, merely because she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had shown kindness to Helena, and because she (<font color='blue'><b>Helena</b></font>) bore a high character. Lady Delacour was a woman who never listened to reason, or who listened to it only that she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) might parry it by wit. Upon this occasion, her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) wit had not its usual effect upon Miss Portman; instead of entertaining, it disgusted her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You have called me your friend, Lady Delacour,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``I should but ill deserve that name, if I had not the courage to speak the truth to you -- if I had not the courage to tell you when I think you are wrong.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I have not the courage to hear you, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>said Lady Delacour, stopping her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) ears. <div class="bookquote">``So your conscience may be at ease; you may suppose that you have said everything that is wise, and good, and proper, and sublime, and that you deserve to be called the best of friends; you shall enjoy the office of censor to Lady Delacour, and welcome; but remember, it is a sinecure place, though I will pay you with my love and esteem to any extant you please. You sigh -- for my folly. Alas! my dear, `tis hardly worth while -- my follies will soon be at an end. Of what use could even the wisdom of Solomon be to me now? If you have any humanity, you will not force me to reflect: whilst I yet live, I must keep it up with incessant dissipation -- the teetotum keeps upright only while it spins: so let us talk of the birthnight, or the new play that we are to see to-night, or the ridiculous figure Lady H-- made at the concert; of let us talk of Harrowgate, or what you will.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div><p/>Pity succeeded to disgust and displeasure in Belinda's mind, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) could hardly refrain from tears, whilst she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) saw this unhappy creature, with forced smiles, endeavor to hide the real anguish of her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) soul: she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) could only say, <div class="bookquote">``But, my dear Lady Delacour, do not you think that your little Helena, who seems to have a most affectionate disposition, would add to your happiness at home?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Her (<font color='blue'><b>Helena</b></font>) affectionate disposition can be nothing to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>said Lady Delacour.

<p/>Belinda felt a hot tear drop upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) hand, which lay upon Lady Delacour's lap.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Can you wonder,''  (<font color='red'><b>ladyship</b></font>)</div>continued her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) ladyship, hastily wiping away the tear which she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) had let fall; `can you wonder that I should talk of detesting Lady Anne Percival? You see she (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) has robbed me of the affections of my child. Helena asks to come home: yes, but how does she (<font color='blue'><b>Helena</b></font>) ask it? Coldly, formally, -- as a duty. But look at the end of her (<font color='blue'><b>Helena</b></font>) letter; I have read it all -- every bitter word of it I have tasted. How differently she (<font color='blue'><b>Helena</b></font>) writes -- look even at the flowing hand -- the moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Helena</b></font>) begins to speak of Lady Anne Percival; then her (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) soul breaks out: <div class="bookquote">``Lady Anne Percival has offered to take her (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) to Oakly-park -- she (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) should be extremely happy to go, if I please.''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Anne/Lady Anne Percival/Percival</b></font>)</div>Yes, let her (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) go; let her (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) go as far from me as possible; let her (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) never, never see her (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) wretched mother more! -- Write.<div class="bookquote">'' Said Lady Delacour, turning hastily to Belinda, `write in my name, and tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) to go to Oakly-park, and to be happy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But why should you take it for granted that she (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) cannot be happy with you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Belinda. <div class="bookquote">``Let us see her (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) -- let us try the experiment.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>said Lady Delacour; `no -- it is too late: I will never condescend in my last moments to beg for that affection to which it may be thought I have forfeited my natural claim.''

<p/>Pride, anger, and sorrow, struggled in her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) countenance as she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) spoke. She (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) face from Belinda, and walked out of the room with dignity.

<p/>Nothing remains for me to do, thought Belinda, but to soothe this haughty spirit: all other hope, I see, is vain.

<p/>At this moment Clarence Hervey, who had no suspicion that the gay, brilliant Lady Delacour was sinking into the grave, had formed a design worthy of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) ardent and benevolent character. The manner in which her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) ladyship had spoken of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) friend Dr X --, the sigh which she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) gave at the reflection that she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) might have been a very different character if she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) had early had a sensible friend, made a great impression on Mr Hervey. Till then, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) had merely considered her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) ladyship as an object of amusement, and an introduction to high life; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) now felt so much interested for her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>), that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) determined to exert all of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) influence to promote her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) happiness. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) knew that influence to be considerable: not that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) was either coxcomb or dupe enough to imagine that Lady Delacour was in love with him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) was perfectly sensible that her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) only wish was to obtain his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) admiration, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) resolved to show her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) that it could no longer be secured without deserving his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) esteem. Clarence Hervey was a thoroughly generous young man: capable of making the greatest sacrifices, when encouraged by the hope of doing good, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) determined to postpone the declaration of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) attachment to Belinda, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) might devote himself entirely to his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) new project. His (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) plan was to wean Lady Delacour by degrees from dissipation, by attaching her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) to her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) daughter, and to Lady Anne Percival. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) was sanguine in all his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) hopes, and rapid, but not unthinking, in all his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) decisions. From Lady Delacour he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) went immediately to Dr X--, to whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) communicated his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) designs.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I applaud your benevolent intentions,''  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor presumption</b></font>)</div>said the doctor: `but have you really the presumption to hope, that an ingenuous young man of four-and-twenty can reform a veteran coquet of four-and-thirty?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Lady Delacour is not yet thirty,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div>said Clarence; `but the older she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) is, the better the chance of her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) giving up a losing game. She (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) has an admirable understanding, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) will soon -- I mean as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) is acquainted with Lady Anne Percival -- discover that she (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) has mistaken the road to happiness. All the difficulty will be to make them fairly acquainted with each other; for this, my dear doctor, I must trust to you. Do you prepare Lady Anne to tolerate Lady Delacour's faults, and I will prepare Lady Delacour to tolerate Lady Anne's virtues.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You have generously taken the more difficult task of the two,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dr</b></font>)</div>replied Dr X--. <div class="bookquote">``Well, we shall see what can be done. After the birthday, Lady Delacour talks of going to Harrowgate: you know, Oakly-part is not far from Harrowgate, so they will have frequent opportunities for meeting. But, take my word for it, nothing can be done till after the birthday; for Lady Delacour's head is at present full of crape petticoats, and horses, and carriages, and a certain Mrs Luttridge, whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Luttridge</b></font>) hates with a hatred passing that of women.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dr</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER X

<p/>The Mysterious Boudoir

<p/>ACCUSTOMED to study human nature, Dr X-- had acquired peculiar sagacity in judging of character. Notwithstanding the address with which Lady Delacour concealed the real motives for her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) apparently thoughtless conduct, he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) quickly discovered that the hatred of Mrs Luttridge was her (<font color='blue'><b>Luttridge</b></font>) ruling passion. Above nine years of continual warfare had exasperated the tempers of both parties, and no opportunities of manifesting their mutual antipathy were ever neglected. Extravagantly as Lady Delacour loved admiration, the highest possible degree of positive praise was insipid to her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) taste, if it did not imply some superiority over the woman whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) considered as a perpetual rival.

<p/>Now it had been said by the coachmaker, that Mrs Luttridge would sport a most elegant new vis-à-vis on the king's birthday. Lady Delacour was immediately ambitious to outshine her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) in equipage; and it was this paltry ambition that made her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) condescend to all the meanness of the transaction by which she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) obtained Miss Portman's draft, and Clarence Hervey's two hundred guineas. The great, the important day, at length arrived -- her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) ladyship's triumph in the morning at the drawing-room was complete. Mrs Luttridge's horses were nothing, absolutely nothing, in comparison with Lady Delacour's: her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) ladyship enjoyed the full exultation of vanity; and at night she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) went in high spirits to the ball.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, my dearest Belinda,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>), as she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) left her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) dressing-room, `how terrible a thing it is that you cannot go with me! -- None of the joys of this life are without alloy! -- <div class="bookquote">``Twould be too much to see in one night Mrs Luttridge's mortification, and my Belinda's triumph. Adieu! My love: we shall live to see another birthday, it is to be hoped. Marriott, my drops. Oh, I have taken them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div><p/>Belinda, after her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) ladyship's departure, retired to the library. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) time passed so agreeably during Lady Delacour's absence, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) was surprised when she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) heard the clock strike twelve.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it possible,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>), `that I have spent two hours by myself in a library without being tired of my existence? -- How different are my feelings now from what they would have been in the same circumstances six months ago! -- I should then have thought the loss of a birthnight ball a mighty trial of temper. It is singular, that my having spent a winter with one of the most dissipated women in England should have sobered my mind so completely. If I had never seen the utmost extent of the pleasures of the world, as they are called, my imagination might have misled me to the end of my life; but now I can judge from my own experience, and I am convinced that the life of a fine lady would never make me happy. Dr X-- told me, the other day, that he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) thinks me formed for something better, and he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) is incapable of flattery.''

<p/>The idea of Clarence Hervey was so intimately connected with that of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) friend, that Miss Portman could seldom separate them in her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) imagination; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) was just beginning to reflect upon the manner in which Clarence looked, whilst he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) declared to Sir Philip Baddely, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) would never give up Dr X--, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) was startled by the entrance of Marriott.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Miss Portman, what shall we do? What shall we do? -- My lady! My poor lady!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>cried she (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is the matter?''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Belinda.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The horses -- the young horses! -- Oh, I wish my lady had never seen them. Oh, my lady, my poor lady, what will become of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div><p/>It was some minutes before Belinda could obtain from Marriott any intelligible account of what had happened.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``All I know, ma'am, is what James has just told me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marriott/Mrs Marriott</b></font>)</div>said Marriott. ``My lady gave the coachman orders upon no account to let Mrs Luttridge's carriage get before hers. Mrs Luttridge's coachman would not give up the point either. My lady's horses were young and ill broke, they tell me, and there was no managing of them no ways. The carriages got somehow across one another, and my lady was overturned, and all smashed to atoms. Oh, ma``am,<div class="bookquote">'' continued Marriott, `if it had not been for Mr Hervey, they say, my lady would never have been got out of the crowd alive. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>)'s bringing her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) home in his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) own carriage, God bless him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But is Lady Delacour hurt?''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>cried Belinda.

<p/>``She (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) must, -- to be sure, she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) must, ma``am,'' cried Marriott, putting her (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) hand upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) bosom. ``But let her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) be ever so much hurt, my lady will keep it to herself: the footmen swear she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) did not give a scream, not a single scream; so it's their opinion she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was no ways hurt -- but that, I know, can't be -- and, indeed, they are thinking so much about the carriage, that they can't give one any rational account of any thing; and, as for myself, I'm sure I'm in such a flutter. Lord know, I advised my lady not to go with the young horses, no later than -- '

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hark!''  (<font color='red'><b>lady</b></font>)</div>cried Belinda, `here they are.'' She (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) ran down stairs instantly. The first object that she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) saw was Lady Delacour in convulsions -- the street-door was open -- the hall was crowded with servants. Belinda made her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) way through them, and, in a calm voice, requested that Lady Delacour might immediately be brought to her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) own dressing-room, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) should there be left to Marriott's care and hers. Mr Hervey assisted in carrying Lady Delacour -- she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) came to her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) senses as they were taking her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) up stairs. ``Set me down, set me down,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) exclaimed: <div class="bookquote">``I am not hurt -- I am quite well. -- Where's Marriott? Where's Miss Portman?''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Here we are -- you shall be carried quite safely -- trust to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Belinda, in a firm tone, `and do not struggle.''

<p/>Lady Delacour submitted: she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) was in agonizing pain, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) fortitude was so great that she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) never uttered a groan. It was the constraint which she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) had put upon herself, by endeavouring not to scream, which threw her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) into convulsions. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) is hurt -- I am sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) is hurt, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) will not acknowledge it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div>cried Clarence Hervey. <div class="bookquote">``My ankle is sprained, that's all,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>said Lady Delacour -- `lay me on this sofa, and leave me to Belinda.''

<p/>``What's all this? Cried Lord Delacour, staggering into the room: he (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) was much intoxicated, and in this condition had just come home, as they were carrying Lady Delacour up stairs: he (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) could not be made to understand the truth, but as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) heard Clarence Hervey's voice, he (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) insisted upon going up to his (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) wife's dressing-room. It was a very unusual thing, but neither Champfort nor any one else could restrain him (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>), the moment that he (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) had formed this idea; he (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) forced his (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) way into the room.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What's all this? -- Colonel Lawless!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>), addressing himself to Clarence Hervey, whom, in the confusion of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) mind, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) mistook for the colonel, the first object of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) jealousy. <div class="bookquote">``Colonel Lawless,''  (<font color='red'><b>lordship</b></font>)</div>cried his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) lordship, `you are a villain. I always knew it.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Softly! -- she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)'s in great pain, my lord,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Belinda, catching Lord Delacour's arm, just as he (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) was going to strike Clarence Hervey. She (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) led him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) to the sofa where Lady Delacour lay, and uncovering her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) ankle, which was much swelled, showed it to him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>)..His (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) lordship, who was a humane man, was somewhat moved by this appeal to his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) remaining senses, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) began roaring as loud as he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) possible could for arquebusade.

<p/>Lady Delacour rested her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) head upon the back to the sofa, her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) hands moved with convulsive twitches -- she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) was perfectly silent. Marriott was in a great bustle, running backwards and forwards for she (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) knew not what, and continually repeating, <div class="bookquote">``I wish nobody would come in here but Miss Portman and me. My lady says nobody must come in. Lord bless me! My lord here too!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you any arquebusade, Marriott? Arquebusade, for your lady, directly!''  (<font color='red'><b>lordship</b></font>)</div>cried his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) lordship, following her (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) to the door to the boudoir, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) was going for some drops.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, my lord, you can't come in, I assure you, my lord, there's nothing here, my lord, nothing of the sort,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marriott/Mrs Marriott</b></font>)</div>said Marriott, setting her (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) back against the door. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) terror and embarrassment instantly recalled all the jealous suspicions of Lord Delacour. <div class="bookquote">``Woman!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>cried he (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``I will see whom you have in this room! -- You have some one concealed there, and I will go in.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Then with brutal oaths he (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) dragged Marriott from the door, and snatched the key from her (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) struggling hand.

<p/>Lady Delacour started up, and gave a scream of agony. <div class="bookquote">``My lord! -- Lord Delacour,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>cried Belinda, springing forward, `hear me.''

<p/>Lord Delacour stopped short. <div class="bookquote">``Tell me, then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Delacour</b></font>)</div>cried Lord Delacour, `is not a lover of Lady Delacour's concealed there?'' ``No! -- No! -- No!'' answered Belinda. ``Then a lover of Miss Portman?'' said Lord Delacour. <div class="bookquote">``Gad! We have hit it now, I believe.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Believe whatever you please, my lord,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Belinda, hastily, `but give me the key.''

<p/>Clarence Hervey drew the key from Lord Delacour's hand, gave it to Miss Portman without looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>), and immediately withdrew. Lord Delacour followed him (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) with a sort of drunken laugh; and no one remained in the room but Marriott, Belinda, and Lady Delacour. Marriott was so much fluttered, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) said, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) could do nothing. Miss Portman locked the room door, and began to undress Lady Delacour, who lay motionless. <div class="bookquote">``Are we by ourselves?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>said Lady Delacour, opening her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes -- are you much hurt?''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Belinda. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, you are a charming girl!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>said Lady Delacour. <div class="bookquote">``Who would have thought you had so much presence of mind and courage -- have you the key safe?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Here it is,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Belinda, producing it; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) repeated her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) question, <div class="bookquote">``Are you much hurt?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I am not in pain now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>said Lady Delacour, `but I have suffered terribly. If I could get rid of all this finery, if you could put me to bed, I could sleep perhaps.''

<p/>Whilst Belinda was undressing Lady Delacour, she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) shrieked several times; but between every interval of pain she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) repeated, <div class="bookquote">``I shall be better to-morrow.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>As soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) was in bed, she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) desired Marriott to give her (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) double her (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) usual quantity of laudanum; for that all the inclination which she (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) had felt to sleep was gone, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) could not endure the shooting pains that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) felt in her (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) breast.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Leave me alone with your lady, Marriott,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Miss Portman, taking the bottle of laudanum from her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) trembling hand, `and go to bed; for I am sure you are not able to sit up any longer.''

<p/>As she (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) spoke, she (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) took Marriott into the adjoining dressing-room. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, dear Miss Portman,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marriott/Mrs Marriott</b></font>)</div>said Marriott, who was sincerely attached to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) lady, and who at this instant forgot all her (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) jealousies, and all her (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) love of power, <div class="bookquote">``I'll do any thing you ask me; but pray let me stay in the room, though I know I'm quite helpless. It will be too much for you to be here all night by yourself. The convulsions may take my lady. What shrieks she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) gives every now and then! -- and nobody knows what's the matter but ourselves; and every body in the house is asking me why a surgeon is not sent for, if my lady is so much hurt. Oh, I can't answer for it to my conscience, to have kept the matter secret so long; for to be sure a physician, if had in time, might have saved my lady -- but now nothing can save her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>lady</b></font>)</div>And here Marriott burst into tears.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why don't you give me the laudanum?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>cried Lady Delacour, in a loud peremptory voice; <div class="bookquote">``Give it to me instantly.''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>-- <div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Miss Portman, firmly. -- <div class="bookquote">``Hear me, Lady Delacour -- you must allow me to judge, for you know that you are not in a condition to judge for yourself, or rather you must allow me to send for a physician, who may judge for us both.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A physician!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>cried Lady Delacour, <div class="bookquote">``Never -- never. I charge you to let no physician be sent for. Remember your promise: you cannot betray me -- you will not betray me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Belinda, `of that I have already given sufficient proof -- but you will betray yourself: it is already known by your servants that you have been hurt by the overturn of your carriage; if you do not let either a surgeon or physician see you it will excite surprise and suspicion. It is not in your power, when violent pain seizes you, to refrain from -- '

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>interrupted Lady Delacour; `not another scream shall you hear -- only do not, do not, my dear Belinda, send for a physician.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You will throw yourself again into convulsions,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Belinda. <div class="bookquote">``Marriott, you see, has lost all command of herself -- I shall not have strength to manage you -- perhaps I may lose my presence of mind -- I cannot answer for myself -- your husband may desire to see you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No danger of that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>said Lady Delacour: `tell him (<font color='blue'><b>physician</b></font>) my ankle is sprained -- tell him (<font color='blue'><b>physician</b></font>) I am bruised all over -- tell him (<font color='blue'><b>physician</b></font>) anything you will -- he (<font color='blue'><b>physician</b></font>) will not trouble himself any more about me -- he (<font color='blue'><b>physician</b></font>) will forget all that passed to-night by the time he (<font color='blue'><b>physician</b></font>) is sober. Oh! give me the laudanum, dearest Belinda, and say no more about physicians.''

<p/>It was in vain to reason with Lady Delacour. Belinda attempted to persuade her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>): <div class="bookquote">``For my sake, Lady Delacour,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>), `let me send for Dr X--; he (<font color='blue'><b>physician</b></font>) is a man of honour, your secret will be perfectly safe with him (<font color='blue'><b>physician</b></font>).''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) will tell it to Clarence Hervey,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>said Lady Delacour: `of all men living, I would not send for Dr X--; I will not see him (<font color='blue'><b>physician</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>physician</b></font>) comes.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Belinda, calmly, but with a fixed determination of countenance, <div class="bookquote">``I must leave you to-morrow morning -- I must return to Bath.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Leave me! remember your promise.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Circumstances have occurred, about which I have made no promise,'' said Belinda; <div class="bookquote">``I must leave you, unless you will now give me your permission to send for Dr X--.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Lady Delacour hesitated. <div class="bookquote">``You see,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>continued Belinda, `that I am in earnest: when I am gone, you will have no friend left; when I am gone, your secret will inevitably be discovered; for without me, Marriott will not have sufficient strength of mind to keep it.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you think we might trust Dr X--?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>said Lady Delacour.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sure you may trust him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Belinda, with energy; <div class="bookquote">``I will pledge my life upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) honour.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then send for him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>), since it must be so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>said Lady Delacour.

<p/>No sooner had the words passed Lady Delacour's lips than Belinda flew to execute her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) orders. Marriott recovered her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) senses when she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) heard that her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) ladyship had consented to send for a physician; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) declared that she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) could not conceive how any thing less than the power of magic could have brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) lady to such a determination.

<p/>Belinda had scarcely despatched a servant for Dr X--, when Lady Delacour repented of the permission she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) had given, and all that could be said to pacify only irritated her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) temper. She (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) became delirious; Belinda's presence of mind never forsook her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) remained quietly beside the bed waiting for the arrival of Dr X--, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) absolutely refused admittance to the servants, who, drawn by their lady's outrageous cries, continually came to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) door with offers of assistance.

<p/>About four o'clock the doctor arrived, and Miss Portman was relieved from some of her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) anxiety. He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) assured her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) that there was no immediate danger, and he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) promised that the secret which she (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) had entrusted to him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) should be faithfully kept. He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) remained with her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) some hours, till Lady Delacour became more quiet and fell asleep, exhausted with delirious exertions. -- <div class="bookquote">``I think I may now leave you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dr</b></font>)</div>said Dr X--; but as he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) was going through the dressing-room, Belinda stopped him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>). -- <div class="bookquote">``Now that I have time to think of myself,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>), `let me consult you as my friend: I am not used to act entirely for myself, and I shall be most grateful if you will assist me with your advice. I hate all mysteries, but I feel myself bound in honour to keep the secret with which Lady Delacour has entrusted me. Last night I was so circumstanced, that I could not extricate her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) ladyship without exposing myself to -- to suspicion.''

<p/>Miss Portman then related all that had passed about the mysterious door, which Lord Delacour, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) fit of drunken jealousy, had insisted upon breaking open.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr Hervey,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>continued Belinda, `was present when all this happened -- he (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) seemed much surprised: I should be sorry that he (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) should remain in an error which might be fatal to my reputation -- you know a woman ought not even to be suspected; yet how to remove this suspicion I know not, because I cannot enter into any explanation, without betraying Lady Delacour -- she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) has, I know, a peculiar dread of Mr Hervey's discovering the truth.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And is it possible,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dr</b></font>)</div>cried Dr X--, `that any woman should be so meanly selfish, as thus to expose the reputation of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) friend merely to preserve her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) own vanity from mortification?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hush -- don't speak so loud,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Belinda, `you will awaken her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>); and at present she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) is certainly more an object of pity than of indignation. -- If you will have the goodness to come with me, I will take you by a back staircase up to the mysterious boudoir. I am not too proud to give positive proofs of my speaking truth; the key of that room now lies on Lady Delacour's bed -- it was that which she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) grasped in her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) hand during her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) delirium -- you shall see,<div class="bookquote">'' added Miss Portman with a smile, `that I am not afraid to let you unlock either of them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>``As a polite man, said Dr X--, ``I believe that I should absolutely refuse to take any external evidence of a lady's truth; but demonstration is unanswerable even by enemies, and I will not sacrifice your interests to the foppery of my politeness -- so I am ready to follow you. The curiosity of the servants may have been excited by last night's disturbance, and I see no method as certain as that which you propose of preventing busy rumour. That goddess -LRB-let Ovid say what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pleases-RRB- was born and bred in a kitchen, or a servants' hall. -- But,<div class="bookquote">'' continued Dr X--, `my dear Miss Portman, you will put a stop to a number of charming stories by this prudence of yours -- a romance called the Mysterious Boudoir, of nine volumes at least, might be written on this subject, if you would only condescend to act like almost all other heroines, that is to say, without common sense.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The doctor</b></font>)</div><p/>The doctor now followed Belinda, and satisfied himself by ocular demonstration, that this cabinet was the retirement of disease, and not of pleasure.

<p/>It was about eight o'clock in the morning when Dr X-- got home; he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) found Clarence Hervey waiting for him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>). Clarence seemed to be in great agitation, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) endeavoured, with all the power which he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) possessed over himself, to suppress his (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) emotion.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You have been to see Lady Delacour,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>), calmly: `is she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) much hurt? -- It was a terrible accident.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) has been much hurt,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dr</b></font>)</div>said Dr X--, `and she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) has been for some hours delirious; but ask me no more questions now, for I am asleep, and must go to bed, unless you have any thing to say that can waken me: you look as if some great misfortune had befallen you; what is the matter?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, my dear friend,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div>said Hervey, taking his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) hand, `do not jest with me; I am not able to bear your raillery in my present temper -- in one word, I fear that Belinda is unworthy of my esteem: I can tell you no more, except that I am more miserable than I thought any woman could make me.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are in a prodigious hurry to be miserable,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dr</b></font>)</div>said Dr X--. <div class="bookquote">``Upon my word I think you would make a mighty pretty hero in a novel; you take things very properly for granted, and, stretched out upon that sofa, you act the distracted lover vastly well -- and to complete the matter, you cannot tell me why you are more miserable than ever man or hero was before. I must tell you, then, that you have still more cause for jealousy than you suspect. Ay, start -- every jealous man starts at the sound of the word jealousy -- a certain symptom this of the disease.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You mistake me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div>cried Clarence Hervey; `no man is less disposed to jealousy than I am -- but -- '

<p/>``But your mistress -- no, not your mistress, for you have never yet declared to her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) your attachment -- but the lady you admire will not let a drunken man unlock a door, and you immediately suppose -- '

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) has mentioned the circumstance to you!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Hervey, in a joyful tone: `then she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) must be innocent.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Admirable reasoning! -- I was going to have told you just now, if you would have suffered me to speak connectedly, that you have more reason for jealousy than you suspect, for Miss Portman has actually unlocked for me -- for me! look at me -- the door, the mysterious door -- and whilst I live, and whilst she (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) lives, we can neither of us tell you the cause of the mystery. All I can tell you is, that no lover is in the case, upon my honour -- and now, if you should ever mistake curiosity in your own mind for jealousy, expect no pity from me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should deserve none,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div>said Clarence Hervey; `you have made me the happiest of men.''

<p/>``The happiest of men! -- No, no; keep that superlative exclamation for a future occasion. But now you behave like a reasonable creature, you deserve to hear the praises of your Belinda -- I am so much charmed with her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>), that I wish -- '

<p/><div class="bookquote">``When can I see her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div>interrupted Hervey; <div class="bookquote">``I'll go to her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) this instant.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Gently,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dr</b></font>)</div>said Dr X--, `you forget what time of the day it is -- you forget that Miss Portman has been up all night -- that Lady Delacour is extremely ill -- and that this would be the most unseasonable opportunity you could possibly choose for your visit.''

<p/>To this observation Clarence Hervey assented; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) immediately seized a pen from the doctor's writing table, and began a letter to Belinda. The doctor threw himself upon the sofa, saying, <div class="bookquote">``Waken me when you want me,''  (<font color='red'><b>The doctor</b></font>)</div>and in a few minutes he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) was fast asleep.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Doctor, upon second thoughts,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div>said Clarence, rising suddenly, and tearing his (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) letter down the middle, <div class="bookquote">``I cannot write to her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) yet -- I forgot the reformation of Lady Delacour: how soon do you think she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) will be well? Besides, I have another reason for not writing to Belinda at present -- you must know, my dear doctor, that I have, or had, another mistress.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Another mistress, indeed!''  (<font color='red'><b>Dr</b></font>)</div>cried Dr X--, trying to waken himself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good Heavens! I do believe you've been asleep.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do believe I have.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But is it possible that you could fall sound asleep in that time?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very possible,''  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>said the doctor: `what is there so extraordinary in a man's falling asleep? Men are apt to sleep sometime within the four-and-twenty hours, unless they have half-a-dozen mistresses to keep them awake, as you seem to have, my good friend.''

<p/>A servant now came into the room with a letter, that had just arrived express from the country for Dr X--.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This is another affair,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>cried he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>), rousing himself.

<p/>The letter required the doctor's immediate attendance. He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) shook hands with Clarence Hervey: <div class="bookquote">``My dear friend, I am really concerned that I cannot stay to hear the history of your six mistresses; but you see that this is an affair of life and death.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Farewell,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div>said Clarence: <div class="bookquote">``I have not six, I have only three goddesses; even if you count Lady Delacour for one. But I really wanted your advice in good earnest.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div><p/>``If your case be desperate, you can write, cannot you? Direct to me at Horton-hall, Cambridge. In the mean time, as far as general rules go, I can give you my advice gratis, in the formula of an old Scotch song --

<p/>'''`Tis good to be merry and wise,

CHAPTER XI

<p/>Difficulties

<p/>BEFORE he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) left town, Dr X-- called in Berkeley-square, to see Lady Delacour; he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) found that she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) was out of all immediate danger. Miss Portman was sorry that he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) was obliged to quit her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) at this time, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) felt the necessity for his (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) going; he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) was sent for to attend Mr Horton, an intimate friend of his (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>), a gentleman of great talents, and of the most active benevolence, who had just been seized with a violent fever, in consequence of his (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) exertions in saving the poor inhabitants of a village in his (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) neighbourhood from the effect of a dreadful fire, which broke out in the middle of the night.

<p/>Lady Delacour, who heard Dr X-- giving this account to Belinda, drew back her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) curtain, and said, <div class="bookquote">``Go this instant, doctor -- I am out of all immediate danger, you say; but if I were not -- I must die in the course of a few months, you know -- and what is my life, compared with the chance of saving your excellent friend! He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) is of some use in the world -- I am of none -- go this instant, doctor.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What a pity,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dr</b></font>)</div>said Dr X--, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) left the room, `that a woman who is capable of so much magnanimity should have wasted her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) life on petty objects!''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) life is not yet at an end -- oh, sir, if you could save her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>cried Belinda.

<p/>Doctor X-- shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) head; but returning to Belinda, after going half way down stairs, he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) added, `when you read this paper, you will know all that I can tell you upon the subject.''

<p/>Belinda, the moment the doctor was gone, shut herself up in her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) own room to read the paper which he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) had given to her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>). Dr X-- first stated that he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) was by no means certain that Lady Delacour really had the complaint which she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) so much dreaded; but it was impossible for him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) decide without farther examination, to which her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) ladyship could not be prevailed upon to submit. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) mentioned all that he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) thought would be most efficacious to mitigating the pain that Lady Delacour might feel, and all that could be done, with the greatest probability of prolonging her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) life. And he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) concluded with the following words: `these are all temporizing expedients: according to the usual progress of the disease, Lady Delacour may live a year, or perhaps two.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is possible that her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) life may be saved by a skilful surgeon. By a few words that dropped from her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) ladyship last night, I apprehend that she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) has some thoughts of submitting to an operation, which will be attended with much pain and danger, even if she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) employ the most experienced surgeon in London; but if she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) put herself, from a vain hope of secrecy, into ignorant hands, she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) will inevitably destroy herself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div><p/>After reading this paper, Belinda had some faint hopes that Lady Delacour's life might be saved; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) determined to wait till Dr X-- should return to town, before she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) mentioned his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) opinion to his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) patient; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) earnestly hoped that no idea of putting herself into ignorant hands would recur to her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) ladyship.

<p/>Lord Delacour, in the morning, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) was sober, retained but a confused idea of the events of the preceding night; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) made an awkwardly good-natured apology to Miss Portman for his (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) intrusion, and for the disturbance he (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) had occasioned, which, he (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) said, must be laid to the blame of Lord Studley's admirable burgundy. He (<font color='blue'><b>Studley</b></font>) expressed much concern for Lady Delacour's terrible accident; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Studley</b></font>) could not help observing, that if his (<font color='blue'><b>Studley</b></font>) advice had been taken, the thing could not have happened -- that it was the consequence of her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) ladyship's self-willedness about the young horses.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) got the horses without paying for them, or how she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) got money to pay for them, I know not,''  (<font color='red'><b>lordship</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>Studley</b></font>) lordship; `for I said I would have nothing to do with the business, and I have kept my resolution.''

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Studley</b></font>) lordship finished his (<font color='blue'><b>Studley</b></font>) morning visit to Miss Portman, by observing that `the house would now be very dull for her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>): that the office of a nurse was ill-suited to so young and beautiful a lady, but that her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) undertaking it with so much cheerfulness was a proof of a degree of good-nature that was not always to be met with in the young and handsome.''

<p/>The manner in which Lord Delacour spoke convinced Belinda that he (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) was in reality attached to his (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) wife, however the fear of being, of of appearing to be, governed by her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) ladyship might have estranged him (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) from her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), and from home. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) now saw in him (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) much more good sense, and symptoms of a more amiable character, than his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) lady had described, or than she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) ever would allow that he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) possessed.

<p/>The reflections, however, which Miss Portman made upon the miserable life this ill-matched couple led together, did not incline her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) in favour of marriage in general; great talents on one side, and good-nature on the other had, in this instance, tended only to make each party unhappy. Matches of interest, convenience, and vanity, she (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) was convinced, diminished instead of increasing happiness. Of domestic felicity, she (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) had never, except during her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) childhood, seen examples -- she (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) had, indeed, heard from Dr X-- descriptions of the happy family of Lady Anne Percival, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) feared to indulge the romantic hope of ever being loved by a man of superior genius and virtue, with a temper and manners suited to her (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) taste. The only person she (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) had seen, who at all answered this description, was Mr Hervey; and it was firmly fixed in her (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) mind, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) was not a marrying man, and consequently not a man of whom any prudent woman would suffer herself to think with partiality. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) could not doubt that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) liked her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) society and conversation; his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) manner had sometimes expressed more than cold esteem. Lady Delacour had assured her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) that it expressed love; but Lady Delacour was an imprudent woman in her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) own conduct, and not scrupulous as to that of others. Belinda was not guided by her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) opinions of propriety; and now that her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) ladyship was confined to her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) bed, and not in a condition to give her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) either advice or protection, she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) felt that it was peculiarly incumbent on her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) to guard, not only her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) conduct from reproach, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) heart from the hopeless misery of an ill-placed attachment. She (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) examined herself with firm impartiality; she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) recollected the excessive pain that she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) had endured, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) had first heard Clarence Hervey say, that Belinda Portman was a compound of art and affectation; but this she (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) thought was only the pain of offended pride -- of proper pride. She (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) recollected the extreme anxiety she (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) had felt, even within the last four-and-twenty hours, concerning the opinion which he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) might form of the transaction about the key of the boudoir -- but this anxiety she (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) justified to herself; it was due, she (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) thought, to her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) reputation; it would have been inconsistent with female delicacy to have been indifferent about the suspicions that necessarily arose from the circumstances in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) was placed. Before Belinda had completed her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) self-examination, Clarence Hervey called to inquire after Lady Delacour. Whilst he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) spoke of her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) ladyship, and of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) concern for the dreadful accident of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) believed himself to be in a great measure the cause, his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) manner and and language were animated and unaffected; but the moment that this subject was exhausted, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) became embarrassed; though he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) distinctly expressed perfect confidence and esteem for her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) seemed to wish, and yet to be unable, to support the character of a friend, contradistinguished to an admirer. He (<font color='blue'><b>admirer</b></font>) seemed conscious that he (<font color='blue'><b>admirer</b></font>) could not, with propriety, advert to the suspicions and jealousy which he (<font color='blue'><b>admirer</b></font>) had felt the preceding night; for a man who has never declared love would be absurd and impertinent, were he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to betray jealousy. Clarence was destitute neither of address nor presence of mind; but an accident happened, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) was just taking leave of Miss Portman, which threw him (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) into utter confusion. It surprised, if it did not confound, Belinda. She (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) had forgotten to ask Dr X-- for his (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) direction; and as she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) thought it might be necessary to write to him (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) concerning Lady Delacour's health, she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) begged of Mr Hervey to give it to her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) took a letter out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) pocket, and wrote the direction with a pencil; but as he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) opened the paper, to tear off the outside, on which he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) had been writing, a lock of hair dropped out of the letter; he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) hastily stooped for it, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) took it up from the ground the lock unfolded. Belinda, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) cast but one involuntary, hasty glance at it, was struck with the beauty of its colour, and its uncommon length. The confusion of Clarence Hervey convinced her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) was extremely interested about the person to whom the hair belonged, and the species of alarm which she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) had felt at this discovery opened her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) eyes effectually to the state of her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) own heart. She (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) was sensible that the sight of a lock of hair, however long or however beautiful, in the hands of any man but Clarence Hervey, could not possibly have excited any emotion in her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) mind. <div class="bookquote">``Fortunately,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``I have discovered that he (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) is attached to another, whilst it is yet in my power to command my affections; and he (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) shall see that I am not so weak as to form any false expectations from what I must now consider as mere common-place flattery.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Belinda was glad that Lady Delacour was not present at the discovery of the lock of hair, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) was aware that she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) would have rallied her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) unmercifully upon the occasion; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) rejoiced that she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) had not been prevailed upon to give Madame la Comtesse de Pomenars a lock of her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) belle chevelure. She (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) could not help thinking, from the recollection of several minute circumstances, that Clarence Hervey had endeavoured to gain an interest in her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) affections, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) felt that there would be great impropriety in receiving his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) ambiguous visits during Lady Delacour's confinement to her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) room. She (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) therefore gave orders that Mr Hervey should not in future be admitted, till her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) ladyship should again see company. This precaution proved totally superfluous, for Mr Hervey never called again, during the whole course of Lady Delacour's confinement, though his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) servant regularly came every morning with inquiries after her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) ladyship's health. She (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) room for about ten days; a confinement to which she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) submitted with extreme impatience: bodily pain she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) bore with fortitude, but constraint and ennui she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) could not endure.

<p/>One morning as she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) was sitting up in bed, looking over a large collection of notes, and cards of inquiry after her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) health, she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) exclaimed --

<p/><div class="bookquote">``These people will soon be tired of 4 bidding their footman put it into their heads to inquire whether I am alive or dead -- I must appear amongst them again, if it be only for a few minutes, or they will forget me. When I am fatigued, I will retire, and you, my dear Belinda, shall represent me; so tell them to open my doors, and unmuffle the knocker: let me hear the sound of music and dancing, and let the house be filled again, for Heaven's sake. Dr Zimmermann should never have been my physician, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Zimmermann</b></font>) would have prescribed solitude. Now solitude and silence are worse for me than poppy and mandragora. It is impossible to tell how much silence tires the ears of those who have not been used to it. For mercy's sake, Marriott,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>continued her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) ladyship, turning to Marriott, who just then came softly into the room, `for mercy's sake, don't walk to all eternity on tiptoes: to see people gliding about like ghosts makes me absolutely fancy myself amongst the shades below. I would rather be stunned by the loudest peal that ever thundering footman gave at my door, than hear Marriott lock that boudoir, as if my life depended on my not hearing the key turned.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear my! I never knew any lady that was ill, except my lady, complain of one's not making a noise to disturb her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Marriott/Mrs Marriott</b></font>)</div>said Marriott.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then to please you, Marriott, I will complain of the only noise that does, or ever did disturb me -- the screaming of your odious macaw.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Marriott/Mrs Marriott</b></font>)</div><p/>Now Marriott had a prodigious affection for this macaw, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) defended it with as much eagerness as if it had been her (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) child.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Odious! O dear, my lady! to call my poor macaw odious! -- I didn't expect it would ever have come to this -- I am sure I don't deserve it -- I'm sure I don't deserve that my lady should have taken such a dislike to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Marriott/Mrs Marriott</b></font>)</div><p/>And here Marriott actually burst into tears. <div class="bookquote">``But, my dear Marriott,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>said Lady Delacour, ``I only object to your macaw -- may not I dislike your macaw without disliking you? -- I have heard of ``love me, love my dog;'' but I never heard of ``love me, love my bird<div class="bookquote">'' -- did you, Miss Portman?''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>Marriott turned sharply round upon Miss Portman, and darted a fiery look at her (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) through the midst of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) tears. <div class="bookquote">``Then `tis plain,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>), `who I'm to thank for this;' and as she (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) left the room her (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) lady could not complain of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) shutting the door after her (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) too gently.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Give her (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) three minutes' grace and she (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) will come to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) senses,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>said Lady Delacour, `for she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) is not a bankrupt in sense. Oh, three minutes won't do; I must allow her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) three days' grace, I perceive,'' said Lady Delacour when Marriott half an hour afterward reappeared, with a face which might have sat for the picture of ill-humour. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) ill-humour, however, did not prevent her (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) from attending her (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) lady as usual; she (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) performed all her (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) customary offices with the most officious zeal but in profound silence, except every now and then she (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) would utter a sigh, which seemed to say, <div class="bookquote">``See how much I'm attached to my lady, and yet my lady hates my macaw!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) lady, who perfectly understood the language of sighs, and felt the force of Marriott's, forbore to touch again on the tender subject of the macaw, hoping that when her (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) house was once more filled with company, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) should be relieved by more agreeable noises from continually hearing this pertinacious tormentor.

<p/>As soon as it was known that Lady Delacour was sufficiently recovered to receive company, her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) door was crowded with carriages; and as soon as it was understood that balls and concerts were to go on as usual at her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) house, her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) `troops of friends' appeared to congratulate her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>), and to amuse themselves.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How stupid it is,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>said Lady Delacour to Belinda, `to hear congratulatory speeches from people, who would not care if I were in the black hole at Calcutta this minute; but we must take the world as it goes -- dirt and precious stones mixed together. Clarence Hervey, however, n'a pas une ame de boue, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>), I am sure, has been really concerned for me: he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) thinks that his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) young horses were the sole cause of the whole evil, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) blames himself so sincerely, and so unjustly, that I really was half tempted to undeceive him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>); but that would have been doing him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) an injury, for you know great philosophers tell us that there is no pleasure in the world equal to that of being well deceived, especially by the fair sex. Seriously, Belinda, is it my fancy, or is not Clarence wonderfully changed? Is not he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) grown pale, and thin, and serious, not to say melancholy? What have you done to him (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) since I have been ill?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing -- I have never seen him (<font color='blue'><b>macaw</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No! then the thing is accounted for very naturally -- he (<font color='blue'><b>macaw</b></font>) is in despair because he (<font color='blue'><b>macaw</b></font>) has been banished from your divine presence.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``More likely because he (<font color='blue'><b>macaw</b></font>) has been in anxiety about your ladyship,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Belinda.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I will find out the cause, let it be what it may,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>said Lady Delacour: `luckily my address is equal to my curiosity, and that is saying a great deal.''

<p/>Notwithstanding all her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) ladyship's address, her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) curiosity was baffled; she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) could not discover Clarence Hervey's secret, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) began to believe that the change which she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) had noticed in his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) looks and manner was imaginary or accidental. Had she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) seen more of him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) at this time, she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) would not have so easily given up her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) suspicions; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) only for a few minutes every day, and during that time he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) talked to her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) with all his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) former gaiety; besides, Lady Delacour had herself a daily part to perform, which occupied almost her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) whole attention. Notwithstanding the vivacity which she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) affected, Belinda perceived that she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) was now more seriously alarmed than she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) had ever been about her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) health. It was all that her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) utmost exertions could accomplish, to appear for a short time in the day -- some evenings she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) came into company only for half an hour, on other days only for a few minutes, just walked through the rooms, paid her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) compliments to every body, complained of a nervous head-ache, left Belinda to do the honours for her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>), and retired.

<p/>Miss Portman was now really placed in a difficult and dangerous situation, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) had ample opportunities of learning and practising prudence. All the fashionable dissipated young men in London frequented Lady Delacour's house, and it was said that they were drawn thither by the attractions of her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) fair representative. The gentlemen considered a niece of Mrs Stanhope as their lawful prize. The ladies wondered that the men could think Belinda Portman a beauty; but whilst they affected to scorn, they sincerely feared her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) charms. Thus left entirely to her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) own discretion, she (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) was exposed at once to the malignant eye of envy, and the insidious voice of flattery -- she (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) had no friend, no guide, and scarcely a protector: her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) aunt Stanhope's letters, indeed, continually supplied her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) with advice, but with advice which she (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) could not follow consistently with her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) own feelings and principles. Lady Delacour, even if she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) had been well, was not a person on whose counsels she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) could rely; our heroine was not one of those daring spirits, who are ambitious of acting for themselves; she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) felt the utmost diffidence of her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) own powers, yet at the same time a firm resolution not to be led even by timidity into follies which the example of Lady Delacour had taught her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) to despise. Belinda's prudence seemed to increase with the necessity for its exertion. It was not the mercenary wily prudence of a young lady, who has been taught to think it virtue to sacrifice the affections of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) heart to the interests of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) fortune -- it was not the prudence of a cold and selfish, but of a modest and generous woman. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) found it most difficult to satisfy herself in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) conduct towards Clarence Hervey: he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) seemed mortified and miserable if she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) treated him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) merely as a common acquaintance, yet she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) felt the danger of admitting him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) to the familiarity of friendship. Had she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) been thoroughly convinced that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) was attached to some other woman, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hoped that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) could freely converse with him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>), and look upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) as a married man; but notwithstanding the lock of beautiful hair, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) could not entirely divest herself of the idea that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was beloved, when she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) observed the extreme eagerness with which Clarence Hervey watched all her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) motions, and followed her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) eye as if his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) fate depended upon her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) remarked that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) endeavoured as much as possible to prevent this species of attention from being noticed, either by the public or by herself; his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) manner towards her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) every day became more distant and respectful, more constrained and embarrassed; but now and then a different look and expression escaped. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had often heard of Mr Hervey's great address in affairs of gallantry, and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was sometimes inclined to believe that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) was trifling with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), merely for the glory of a conquest over her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) heart; at other times she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) suspected him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) of deeper designs upon her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), such as would deserve contempt and detestation; but upon the whole she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was disposed to believe that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) was entangled by some former attachment from which he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) could not extricate himself with honour; and upon this supposition she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) thought him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) worthy of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) esteem, and of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) pity.

<p/>About this time Sir Philip Baddely began to pay a sort of lounging attention to Belinda: he (<font color='blue'><b>Baddely</b></font>) knew that Clarence Hervey liked her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>), and this was the principal cause of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) desire to attract her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) attention. ``Belinda Portman' became his (<font color='blue'><b>macaw</b></font>) favourite toast, and amongst his (<font color='blue'><b>macaw</b></font>) companions he (<font color='blue'><b>macaw</b></font>) gave himself the air of talking of her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) with rapture.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Rochfort,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>), one day, to his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) friend, `damme, if I was to think of Belinda Portman in any way -- you take me -- Clary would look damned blue -- hey? -- damned blue, and devilish small, and cursed silly too -- hey?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">''`Pon honour, I should like to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Clary</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Rochfort: <div class="bookquote">''pon honour, he (<font color='blue'><b>Clary</b></font>) deserves it from us, Sir Phil, and I'll stand your friend with the girl, and it will do no harm to give her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) a hint of Clary's Windsor flame, as a dead secret -- `pon honour, he (<font color='blue'><b>Clary</b></font>) deserves it from us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Philip Baddely</b></font>)</div><p/>Now it seems that Sir Philip Baddely and Mr Rochfort, during the time of Clarence Hervey's intimacy with them, observed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) paid frequent visits at Windsor, and they took it into their heads that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) kept a mistress there. They were very curious to see her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>): and, unknown to Clarence, they made several attempts for this purpose: at last one evening, when they were certain that he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) was not at Windsor, they scaled the high garden wall of the house which he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) frequented, and actually obtained a sight of a beautiful young girl and an elderly lady, whom they took for her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) gouvernante. This adventure they kept a profound secret from Clarence, because they knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) would have quarrelled with them immediately, and would have called them to account for their intrusion. They now determined to avail themselves of their knowledge, and of his (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) ignorance of this circumstance: but they were sensible that it was necessary to go warily to work, lest they should betray themselves. Accordingly they began by dropping distant mysterious hints about Clarence Hervey to Lady Delacour and Miss Portman. Such for instance as -- <div class="bookquote">``Damme, we all know Clary's a perfect connoisseur in beauty -- hey, Rochfort? -- one beauty at a time is not enough for him (<font color='blue'><b>Rochfort</b></font>) -- hey, damme? And it is not fashion, nor wit, nor elegance, and all that, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochfort</b></font>) looks for always.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>These observations were accompanied with the most significant looks. Belinda heard and saw all this in painful silence, but Lady Delacour often used her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) address to draw some farther explanation from Sir Philip: his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) regular answer was, <div class="bookquote">``No, no your ladyship must excuse me there; I can't peach, damme -- hey, Rochfort?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Philip Baddely</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) was in hopes, from the reserve with which Miss Portman began to treat Clarence, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) should, without making any distinct charge, succeed in disgusting her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) rival. Mr Hervey was about this time less assiduous than formerly in his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) visits at Lady Delacour's; Sir Philip was there every day, and often for Miss Portman's entertainment exerted himself so far as to tell the news of the town. One morning, when Clarence Hervey happened to be present, the baronet thought it incumbent upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) to eclipse his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) rival in conversation, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) began to talk of the last fête champêtre at Frogmore.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What a cursed unlucky overturn that was of yours, Lady Delacour, with those famous young horses! Why, what with this sprain, and this nervous business, you've not been able to stir out since the birthday, and you've missed the breakfast, and all that, at Frogmore -- why, all the world stayed broiling in town on purpose for it, and you that had a card, too -- how damned provoking!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I regret extremely that my illness prevented me from being at this charming fête; I regret it more on Miss Portman's account than on my own,''  (<font color='red'><b>ladyship</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) ladyship. Belinda assured her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) felt no mortification from the disappointment.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``O, damme! but I would have driven you in my curricle,''  (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Philip Baddely</b></font>)</div>said Sir Philip: `it was the finest sight and best conducted I ever saw, and only wanted Miss Portman to make it complete. We had gipsies, and Mrs Mills the actress for the queen of the gipsies; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mills</b></font>) gave us a famous good song, Rochfort, you know -- and then there was two children upon an ass -- damme, I don't know how they came there, for they're things one sees every day -- and belonged only to two of the soldier's wives -- for we had the whole band of the Staffordshire playing at dinner, and we had some famous glees -- and Fawcett gave us his (<font color='blue'><b>Fawcett</b></font>) laughing song, and then we had the launching of the ships, and only it was a boat, it would have been well enough -- but damme, the song of Polly Oliver was worth the whole -- except the Flemish Hercules, Ducrow, you know, dressed in light blue and silver, and -- Miss Portman, I wish you had seen this -- three great coach-wheels on his (<font color='blue'><b>Hercules</b></font>) chin, and a ladder and two chairs and two children on them -- and after that, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hercules</b></font>) sported a musquet and bayonet with the point of the bayonet on his (<font color='blue'><b>Hercules</b></font>) chin -- faith! that was really famous! But I forgot the Pyrrhic dance, Miss Portman, which was damned fine too -- danced in boots and spurs by those Hungarian fellows -- they jump and turn about, and clap their knees with their hands, and put themselves in all sorts of ways -- and then we had that song of Polly Oliver, as I told you before, and Mrs Mills gave us -- no, no -- it was a drummer of the Staffordshire dressed as a gipsy girl, gave us the cottage on the moor, the most charming thing, and would suit your voice, Miss Portman -- damme, you'd sing it like an angel. -- But where was I? -- Oh, then they had tea -- and fireplaces built of brick, out in the air -- and then the entrance to the ball-room was all a colonnade done with lamps and flowers, and that sort of thing -- and there was some bon-mot -LRB-but that was in the morning-RRB- amongst the gipsies about an orange and the stadtholder -- and then there was a Turkish dance, and a Polonese dance, all very fine, but nothing to come up to the Pyrrhic touch, which was a great deal the most knowing, in boots and spurs -- damme, now, I can't describe the thing to you, `tis a cursed pity you weren't there, damme.''

<p/>Lady Delacour assured Sir Philip that she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) had been more entertained by the description than she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) could have been by the reality. -- <div class="bookquote">``Clarence, was not it the best description you ever heard? But pray favour us with a touch of the Pyrrhic dance, Sir Philip.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div><p/>Lady Delacour spoke with such polite earnestness, and the baronet had so little penetration and so much conceit, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) did not suspect her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) of irony: he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) eagerly began to exhibit the Pyrrhic dance, but in such a manner that it was impossible for human gravity to withstand the sight -- Rochfort laughed first, Lady Delacour followed him (<font color='blue'><b>Rochfort</b></font>), and Clarence Hervey and Belinda could no longer restrain themselves.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Damme, now I believe you've all been quizzing me,''  (<font color='red'><b>the baronet</b></font>)</div>cried the baronet, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) fell into a sulky silence, eyeing Clarence Hervey and Miss Portman from time to time with what he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) meant for a knowing look. His (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) silence and sulkiness lasted till Clarence took his (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) leave. Soon afterward Belinda retired to the music-room. Sir Philip then begged to speak a few words to Lady Delacour, with a face of much importance: and after a preamble of nonsensical expletives, he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) said that his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) regard for her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) ladyship and Miss Portman made him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) wish to explain hints which had been dropped from him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) at times, and which he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) could not explain to her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) satisfaction, without a promise of inviolable secrecy. <div class="bookquote">``As Hervey is or was a sort of a friend, I can't mention this sort of thing without such a preliminary.''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>-- Lady Delacour gave the preliminary promise, and Sir Philip informed her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>), that people began to take notice that Hervey was an admirer of Miss Portman, and that it might be a disadvantage to the young lady, as Mr Hervey could have no serious intentions, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) had an attachment, to his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) certain knowledge, elsewhere.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A matrimonial attachment?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>said Lady Delacour.

<p/>``Why, damme, as to matrimony, I can't say; but the girl's so famously beautiful, and Clary has been constant to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) so many years -- '

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Many years! then she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) is not young?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, damme, yes, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) is not more than seventeen, -- and, let her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) be what else she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) will, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)'s a famous fine girl. I had a sight of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) once at Windsor, by stealth.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the baronet</b></font>)</div><p/>And then the baronet described her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) after his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) manner -- <div class="bookquote">``Where Clary keeps her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) now, I can't make out; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Clary</b></font>) has taken her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) away from Windsor. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was then with a gouvernante, and is as proud as the devil, which smells like matrimony for Clary.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the baronet</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And do you know this peerless damsel's name?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think the old Jezebel called her (<font color='blue'><b>damsel</b></font>) Miss St Pierre -- ay, damme, it was Virginia too -- Virginia St Pierre.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Virginia St Pierre, a pretty romantic name,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>said Lady Delacour: <div class="bookquote">``Miss Portman and I are extremely obliged by your attention to the preservation of our hearts, and I promise you we shall keep your counsel and our own.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div><p/>Sir Philip then, with more than his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) usual complement of oaths, pronounced Miss Portman to be the finest girl he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) had ever seen, and took his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) leave.

<p/>When Lady Delacour repeated this story to Belinda, she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) concluded by saying, <div class="bookquote">``Now, my dear, you know Sir Philip Baddely has his (<font color='blue'><b>Baddely</b></font>) own views in telling us all this -- in telling you all this; for evidently he (<font color='blue'><b>Baddely</b></font>) admires you, and consequently hates Clarence. So I believe only half the man says; and the other half, though it has made you turn so horribly pale, my love, I consider as a thing of no manner of consequence to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of no manner of consequence to me, I assure your ladyship,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Belinda; ``I have always considered Mr Hervey as -- '

<p/>``Oh, as a common acquaintance, no doubt -- but we'll pass over all those pretty speeches: I was going to say that this ``mistress in the wood<div class="bookquote">'' can be of no consequence to your happiness, because, whatever that fool Sir Philip may think, Clarence Hervey is not a man to go and marry a girl who has been his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) mistress for half a dozen years. Do not look so shocked, my dear -- I really cannot help laughing. I congratulate you, however, that the thing is no worse -- it is all in rule and in course -- when a man marries, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sets up new equipages, and casts off old mistresses; or if you like to see the thing as a woman of sentiment rather than as a woman of the world, here is the prettiest opportunity for your lover's making a sacrifice. I am sorry I cannot make you smile, my dear; but consider, as nobody knows this naughty thing but ourselves, we are not called upon to bristle up our morality, and the most moral ladies in the world do not expect a man to be as moral as themselves: so we may suit the measure of our external indignation to our real feelings. Sir Philip cannot stir in the business, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) knows Clarence would call him (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) out if his (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) secret viz to Virginia were to come to light. I advise you d'aller votre train with Clarence, without seeming to suspect him (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) in the least; there is nothing like innocence in these cases, my dear: but I know by the Spanish haughtiness of your air at this instant, that you would sooner die the death of the sentimental -- than follow my advice.''

 (<font color='red'><b>this mistress</b></font>)</div><p/>Belinda, without any haughtiness, but with firm gentleness, replied, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) had no designs whatever upon Mr Hervey, and that therefore there could be no necessity for any manoeuvring on her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) part; -- that the ambiguity of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) conduct towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) had determined her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) long since to guard her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) affections, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) had the satisfaction to feel that they were entirely under her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) command.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That is a great satisfaction, indeed, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>said Lady Delacour. <div class="bookquote">``It is a pity that your countenance, which is usually expressive enough, should not at this instant obey your wishes and express perfect felicity. But though you feel no pain from disappointed affection, doubtless the concern that you show arises from the necessity you are under of withdrawing a portion of your esteem from Mr Hervey -- this is the style for you, is it not? After all, my dear, the whole may be a quizzification of Sir Philip's -- and yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) gave me such a minute description of her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) person! I am sure the man has not invention or taste enough to produce such a fancy piece.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mention,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Belinda, in a low voice, `the colour of her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) hair?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, light brown; but the colour of this hair seems to affect you more than all the rest.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div><p/>Here, to Belinda's great relief, the conversation was interrupted by the entrance of Marriott. From all she (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) had heard, but especially from the agreement between the colour of the hair which dropped from Hervey's letter with Sir Philip's description of Virginia's, Miss Portman was convinced that Clarence had some secret attachment; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) could not help blaming him (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) own mind for having, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) thought, endeavoured to gain her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) affections, whilst he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) knew that his (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) heart was engaged to another. Mr Hervey, however, gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) no farther reason to suspect him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) of any design to win her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) love; for about this time his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) manner towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) changed, -- he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) obviously endeavoured to avoid her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>); his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) visits were short, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) attention was principally directed to Lady Delacour; when she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) retired, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) leave, and Sir Philip Baddely had the field to himself. The baronet, who thought that he (<font color='blue'><b>Baddely</b></font>) had succeeded in producing a coldness between Belinda and his (<font color='blue'><b>Baddely</b></font>) rival, was surprised to find that he (<font color='blue'><b>Baddely</b></font>) could not gain any advantage for himself; for some time he (<font color='blue'><b>Baddely</b></font>) had not the slightest thoughts of any serious connexion with the lady, but at last he (<font color='blue'><b>Baddely</b></font>) was piqued by her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) indifference, and by the raillery of his (<font color='blue'><b>Baddely</b></font>) friend Rochfort.

<p/><div class="bookquote">''`Pon honour,''  (<font color='red'><b>Rochfort/Mr Rochfort</b></font>)</div>said Rochfort, `the girl must be in love with Clary, for she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) minds you no more than if you were nobody.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I could make her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) sing to another tune, if I pleased,''  (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Philip Baddely</b></font>)</div>said Sir Philip; `but, damme, it would cost me too much -- a wife's too expensive a thing, now-a-days. Why, a man could have twenty curricles, and a fine stud, and a pack of hounds, and as many mistresses as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) chooses into the bargain, for what it would cost him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to take a wife. Oh, damme, Belinda Portman's a fine girl, but not worth so much as that comes to; and yet, confound me, if I should not like to see how blue Clary would look, if I were to propose for her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) in good earnest -- hey, Rochfort? -- I should like to pay him (<font color='blue'><b>Rochfort</b></font>) for the way he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochfort</b></font>) served us about that quiz of a doctor, hey?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay,''  (<font color='red'><b>Rochfort/Mr Rochfort</b></font>)</div>said Rochfort, `you know he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochfort</b></font>) told us there was a tant pis and a tant mieux in every thing -- he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochfort</b></font>)'s not come to the tant pis yet. <div class="bookquote">``Pon honour, Sir Philip, the thing rests with you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The baronet</b></font>)</div><p/>The baronet vibrated for some time between the fear of being taken in by one of Mrs Stanhope's nieces, and the hope of triumphing over Clarence Hervey. At last, what he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) called love prevailed over prudence, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) was resolved, cost him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) what it would, to have Belinda Portman. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) had not the least doubt of being accepted, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) made a proposal of marriage; consequently, the moment that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) came to this determination, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) could not help assuming d'avance the tone of a favoured lover.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Damme,''  (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Philip Baddely</b></font>)</div>cried Sir Philip, one night, at Lady Delacour's concert, <div class="bookquote">``I think that Mr Hervey has taken out a patent for talking to Miss Portman; but damme if I give up this place, now I have got it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>cried the baronet, seating himself beside Belinda.

<p/>Mr Hervey did not contest his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) seat, and Sir Philip kept his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) post during the remainder of the concert; but, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) had the field entirely to himself, he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) could not think of any thing more interesting, more amusing, to whisper in Belinda's ear, than, <div class="bookquote">``Don't you think the candles want snuffing famously?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER XII

<p/>The Macaw

<p/>THE baronet determined the next day upon the grand attack. He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) waited upon Miss Portman with the certainty of being favourably received; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) was, nevertheless, somewhat embarrassed to know how to begin the conversation, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) found himself alone with the lady.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) twirled and twisted a short stick that he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) held in his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) hand, and put it into and out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) boot twenty times, and at last he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) began with -- <div class="bookquote">``Lady Delacour's not gone to Harrowgate yet?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No: her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) ladyship has not yet felt herself well enough to undertake the journey.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That was a cursed unlucky overturn! She (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) may thank Clarence Hervey for that: it's like him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>), -- he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) thinks he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>)'s a better judge of horses, and wine, and every thing else, than any body in the world. Damme, now if I don't believe he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) thinks nobody else but himself has eyes enough to see that a fine woman's a fine woman; but I'd have him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) to know, that Miss Belinda Portman has been Sir Philip Baddely's toast these two months.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div><p/>As this intelligence did not seem to make the expected impression upon Miss Belinda Portman, Sir Philip had recourse again to his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) little stick, with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) went through the sword exercise. After a silence of some minutes, and after walking to the window, and back again, as if to look for sense, he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) exclaimed, <div class="bookquote">``How is Mrs Stanhope now, pray, Miss Portman? and your sister, Mrs Tollemache? she (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) was the finest woman, I thought, the first winter she (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) came out, that ever I saw, damme. Have you ever been told that you're like her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, damn it then, but you are; only ten times handsomer.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ten times handsomer than the finest woman you ever saw, Sir Philip?''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Belinda, smiling.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Than the finest woman I had ever seen then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Philip Baddely</b></font>)</div>said Sir Philip; `for, damme, I did not know what it was to be in love then,'' -LRB-here the baronet heaved an audible sigh-RRB-; <div class="bookquote">``I always laughed at love, and all that, then, and marriage particularly. I'll trouble you for Mrs Stanhope's direction, Miss Portman; I believe, to do the thing in style, I ought to write to her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) before I speak to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Belinda looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) with astonishment; and laying down the pencil with which she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) had just begun to write a direction to Mrs Stanhope, she (<font color='blue'><b>Stanhope</b></font>) said, ``Perhaps, Sir Philip, to do the thing in style, I ought to pretend at this instant not to understand you; but such false delicacy might mislead you: permit me, therefore, to say, that if I have any concern in the letter which you are going to write to my aunt Stanhope -- '

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well guessed!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>interrupted Sir Philip: `to be sure you have, and you're a charming girl -- damn me if you aren't -- for meeting my ideas in this way, which will save a cursed deal of trouble,'' added the polite lover, seating himself on the sofa, beside Belinda.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``To prevent your giving yourself any further trouble then, sir, on my account,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Miss Portman --

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, damme, don't catch at that unlucky word, trouble, nor look so cursed angry; though it becomes you, too, uncommonly, and I like pride in a handsome woman, if it was only for variety's sake, for it's not what one meets with often, now-a-days. As to trouble, all I meant was, the trouble of writing to Mrs Stanhope, which of course I thank you for saving me; for to be sure, I'd rather -LRB-and you can't blame me for that-RRB- have my answer from your own charming lips, if it was only for the pleasure of seeing you blush in this heavenly sort of style.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To put an end to this heavenly sort of style, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Belinda, withdrawing her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) hand, which the baronet took as if he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) was confident of its being his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) willing prize, <div class="bookquote">``I must explicitly assure you, that it is not in my power to encourage your address. I am fully sensible,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>added Miss Portman, `of the honour Sir Philip Baddely has done me, and I hope he (<font color='blue'><b>Baddely</b></font>) will not be offended by the frankness of my answer.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You can't be in earnest, Miss Portman!''  (<font color='red'><b>the baronet</b></font>)</div>exclaimed the astonished baronet.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Perfectly in earnest, Sir Philip.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Confusion seize me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>cried he (<font color='blue'><b>Baddely</b></font>), starting up, `if this isn't the most extraordinary thing I ever heard! Will you do me the honour, madam, to let me know your particular objections to Sir Philip Baddely?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My objections,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Belinda, `cannot be obviated, and therefore it would be useless to state them.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, pray, ma'am, do me the favour -- I only ask for information sake -- is it to Sir Philip Baddely's fortune, 15,000l. a year , you object, or to his (<font color='blue'><b>Baddely</b></font>) family, or to his (<font color='blue'><b>Baddely</b></font>) person? Oh, curse it!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Baddely</b></font>), changing his (<font color='blue'><b>Baddely</b></font>) tone, `you're only quizzing me to see how I should look -- damme me, you did it too well, you little coquet!''

<p/>Belinda again assured him (<font color='blue'><b>Baddely</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) was entirely in earnest, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) was incapable of the sort of coquetry which he (<font color='blue'><b>Baddely</b></font>) ascribed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, damme, ma'am, then I've no more to say -- a coquet is a thing I understand as well as another, and if we had been only talking in the air, it would have been another thing; but when I come at once to a proposal in form, and a woman seriously tells me she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) has objections that cannot be obviated, damme, what must I, or what must the world conclude, but that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'s very unaccountable, or that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'s engaged -- which last I presume to be the case, and it would have been a satisfaction to me to have known it sooner -- at any rate, it is a satisfaction to me to know it now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sorry to deprive you of so much satisfaction,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Miss Portman, `by assuring you, that I am not engaged to any one.''

<p/>Here the conversation was interrupted by the entrance of Lord Delacour, who came to inquire of Miss Portman how his (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) lady did. The baronet, after twisting his (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) little black stick into all manner of shapes, finished by breaking it, and then having no other resource, suddenly wished Miss Portman a good morning, and decamped with a look of silly ill-humour. He (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) was determined to write to Mrs Stanhope, whose influence over her (<font color='blue'><b>Stanhope</b></font>) niece he (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) had no doubt would be decisive in his (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) favour. <div class="bookquote">``Sir Philip seems to be a little out of sorts this morning,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Delacour</b></font>)</div>said Lord Delacour: <div class="bookquote">``I am afraid he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)'s angry with me for interrupting his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) conversation; but really I did not know he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) was here, and I wanted to catch you a moment alone, that I might, in the first place, thank you for all your goodness to Lady Delacour. She (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) has had a tedious sprain of it; these nervous fevers and convulsions -- I don't understand them, but I think Dr X--'s prescriptions seem to have done her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) good, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) is certainly better of late, and I am glad to hear music and people again in the house, because I know all this is what my Lady Delacour likes, and there is no reasonable indulgence that I would not willingly allow a wife; but I think there is a medium in all things. I am not a man to be governed by a wife, and when I have once said a thing, I like to be steady and always shall. And I am sure Miss Portman has too much good sense to think me wrong: for now, Miss Portman, in that quarrel about the coach and horses, which you heard part of one morning at breakfast -- I must tell you the beginning of that quarrel.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lord Delacour</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Excuse me, my lord, but I would rather hear of the end than of the beginning of quarrels.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That shows your good sense as well as your good nature. I wish you could make my Lady Delacour of your taste -- she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) does not want sense -- but then -LRB-I speak to you freely of all that lies upon my mind, Miss Portman, for I know -- I know you have no delight in making mischief in a house,-RRB- between you and me, her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) sense is not of the right kind. A woman may have too much wit -- now too much is as bad as too little, and in a woman, worse; and when two people come to quarrel, then wit on either side, but more especially on the wife's, you know is very provoking -- `tis like concealed weapons, which are wisely forbidden by law. If a person kill another in a fray, with a concealed weapon, ma'am, by a sword in a cane, for instance, `tis murder by the law. Now even if it were not contrary to law, I would never have such a thing in my cane to carry about with me; for when a man's in a passion he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) forgets every thing, and would as soon lay about him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) with a sword as with a cane: so it is better such a thing should not be in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) power. And it is the same with wit, which would be safest and best out of the power of some people.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But is it fair, my lord, to make use of wit yourself to abuse wit in others?''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Belinda with a smile, which put his (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) lordship into perfect good-humour with both himself and his (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) lady.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, really,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>), `there would be no living with Lady Delacour, if I did not come out with a little sly bit of wit now and then; but it is what I am not in the habit of doing, I assure you, except when very hard pushed. But, Miss Portman, as you like so much to hear the end of quarrels, here's the end of one which you have a particular right to hear something of,<div class="bookquote">'' continued his (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) lordship, taking out his (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) pocket-book and producing some bank-notes: `you should have received this before, madam, if I had known of the transaction sooner -- of your part of it, I mean.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Milord, de man call to speak about de burgundy you order, milord,''  (<font color='red'><b>Champfort/Monsieur Champfort</b></font>)</div>said Champfort, who came into the room with a sly, inquisitive face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) I'll see him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) immediately -- show him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) into the parlour, and give him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) a newspaper to read.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, milord -- milord has it in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pocket since he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) dress.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Here it is,''  (<font color='red'><b>lordship</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) lordship; and as Champfort came forward to receive the newspaper, his (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) eye glanced at the bank-notes, and then at Miss Portman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Delacour</b></font>)</div>continued Lord Delacour, as Champfort left the room, `here are your two hundred guineas, Miss Portman; and as I am going to this man about my burgundy, and shall be out all the rest of the day, let me trouble you the next time you see Lady Delacour to give her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) this pocket-book from me. I should be sorry that Miss Portman, from anything that has passed, should run away with the idea that I am a niggardly husband, or a tyrant, though I certainly like to be master in my own house. What are you doing, madam? -- that is your note, that does not go into the pocket-book, you know.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Permit me to put it in, my lord,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Belinda, returning the pocket-book to him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>), `and to beg you will give Lady Delacour the pleasure of seeing you: she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) has inquired several times whether your lordship were at home. I will run up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) dressing-room, and tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) that you are here.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How lightly she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) goes on the wings of good-nature!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Delacour</b></font>)</div>said Lord Delacour, <div class="bookquote">``I can do no less than follow her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>); for though I like to be treated with respect in my own house, there is a time for every thing. I would not give Lady Delacour the trouble of coming down here to me with her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) sprained ankle, especially since she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) has inquired for me several times.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lord Delacour</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) lordship's visit was not of unseasonable length; for he (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) recollected that the man who came about the burgundy was waiting for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). But, perhaps, the shortness of the visit rendered it the more pleasing, for Lady Delacour afterward said to Belinda, <div class="bookquote">``My dear, would you believe it, my Lord Delacour was absolutely a perfect example of the useful and agreeable this morning -- who knows but he (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) may become the sublime and beautiful in time? En attendant here are your two hundred guineas, my dear Belinda: a thousand thanks for the thing, and a million for the manner -- manner is all in all in conferring favours. My lord, who, to do him (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) justice, has too much honesty to pretend to more delicacy than he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) really possesses, told me that he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) had been taking a lesson from Miss Portman this morning in the art of obliging; and really, for a grown gentleman, and for the first lesson, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) comes on surprisingly. I do think, that by the time he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) is a widower his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) lordship will be quite another thing, quite an agreeable man -- not a genius, not a Clarence Hervey -- that you cannot expect. Apropos, what is the reason that we have seen so little of Clarence Hervey lately? He (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) has certainly some secret attraction elsewhere. It cannot be that girl Sir Philip mentioned; no, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)'s nothing new. Can it be at Lady Anne Percival's? -- or where can it be? Whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) sees me, I think he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) asks when we go to Harrowgate. Now Oakly-park is within a few miles of Harrowgate. I will not go there, that's decided. Lady Anne is an exemplary matron, so she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) is out of the case; but I hope she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) has no sister excellence, no niece, no cousin, to entangle our hero.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div><p/>``Ours! ' said Belinda.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, yours, then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>said Lady Delacour.

<p/>``Mine! '

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, yours: I never in my life saw a better struggle between a sigh and a smile. But what have you done to poor Sir Philip Baddely? My Lord Delacour told me -- you know all people who have nothing else to say, tell news quicker than others -- my Lord Delacour told me, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) saw Sir Philip part from you this morning in a terrible bad humour. Come, whilst you tell your story, help me to string these pearls; that will save you from the necessity of looking at me, and will conceal your blushes: you need not be afraid of betraying Sir Philip's secrets; for I could have told you long ago, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) would inevitably propose for you -- the fact is nothing new or surprising to me, but I should really like to hear how ridiculous the man made himself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Belinda, `is the only thing which I do not wish to tell your ladyship.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Lord, my dear, surely it is no secret that Sir Philip Baddely is ridiculous; but you are so good-natured that I can't be out of humour with you. If you won't gratify my curiosity, will you gratify my taste, and sing for me once more that charming song which none but you can sing to please me? -- I must learn it from you, absolutely.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div><p/>Just as Belinda was beginning to sing, Marriott's macaw began to scream, so that Lady Delacour could not hear any thing else.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, that odious macaw!''  (<font color='red'><b>ladyship</b></font>)</div>cried her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) ladyship, <div class="bookquote">``I can endure it no longer; -LRB-and she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) rang her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) bell violently-RRB-; `it kept me from sleeping all last night -- Marriott must give up this bird. Marriott, I cannot endure that macaw -- you must part with it for my sake, Marriott. It cost you four guineas: I am sure I would give five with the greatest pleasure to get rid of it, for it is the torment of my life.''

 (<font color='red'><b>ladyship</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear, my lady! I can assure you it is only because they will not shut the doors after them below, as I desire. I am certain Mr Champfort never shut a door after him (<font color='blue'><b>Champfort</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Champfort</b></font>) life, nor never will if he (<font color='blue'><b>Champfort</b></font>) was to live to the days of Methuselah.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is very little satisfaction to me, Marriott,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>said Lady Delacour.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And indeed, my lady, it is very little satisfaction to me, to hear my macaw abused as it is every day of my life, for Mr Champfort's fault.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But it cannot be Champfort's fault that I have ears.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But if the doors were shut, my lady, you wouldn't or couldn't hear -- as I'll prove immediately,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marriott/Mrs Marriott</b></font>)</div>said Marriott, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) ran directly and shut, according to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) own account, `eleven doors which were stark staring wide open.'' -- <div class="bookquote">``Now, my lady, you can't hear a single syllable of the macaw.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, but one of the eleven doors will open presently,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>said Lady Delacour: `you will observe it is always more than ten to one against me.''

<p/>A door opened, and the macaw was heard to scream.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The macaw must go, Marriott, that is certain,''  (<font color='red'><b>ladyship</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) ladyship, firmly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then I must go, my lady,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marriott/Mrs Marriott</b></font>)</div>said Marriott, angrily, `that is certain; for to part with my macaw is a thing I cannot do to please any body.'' Her (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) eyes turned with indignation upon Belinda, from association merely; because the last time that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) had been angry about her (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) macaw, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) had also been angry with Miss Portman, whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) imagined to be the secret enemy of her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) favourite.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``To stay another week in the house after my macaw's discarded in disgrace is a thing nothing shall prevail upon me to do.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) flung out of the room in a fury.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good Heavens! am I reduced to this?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>said Lady Delacour: `she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) thinks that she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) has me in her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) power. No; I can die without her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>): I have but a short time to live -- I will not live a slave. Let the woman betray me, if she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) will. Follow her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) this moment, my dear generous friend; tell her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) never to come into this room again: take this pocket-book, pay her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) whatever is due to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) in the first place, and give her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) fifty guineas -- observe! -- not as a bribe, but as a reward.''

<p/>It was a delicate and difficult commission. Belinda found Marriott at first incapable of listening to reason. <div class="bookquote">``I am sure there is nobody in the world that would treat me and my macaw in this manner, except my lady,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>cried she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>); `and somebody must have set her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) against me, for it is not natural to her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>): but since she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) can't bear me about her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) any longer, `tis time I should be gone.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The only thing of which Lady Delacour complained was the noise of this macaw,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Belinda; `it was a pretty bird -- how long have you had it?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Scarcely a month,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marriott/Mrs Marriott</b></font>)</div>said Marriott, sobbing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And how long have you lived with your lady?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Six years! -- And to part with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) after all! -- '

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And for the sake of a macaw! And at a time when your lady is so much in want of you, Marriott! You know she (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) cannot live long, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) has much to suffer before she (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) dies, and if you leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>), and if in a fit of passion you betray the confidence she (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) has placed in you, you will reproach yourself for it ever afterward. This bird -- or all the birds in the world -- will not be able to console you; for you are of an affectionate disposition, I know, and sincerely attached to your poor lady.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``That I am! -- and to betray her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)! -- Oh, Miss Portman, I would sooner cut off my hand than do it. And I have been tried more than my lady knows of, or you either, for Mr Champfort, who is the greatest mischief-maker in the world, and is the cause, by not shutting the door, of all this dilemma; for now, ma'am, I'm convinced, by the tenderness of your speaking, that you are not the enemy to me I supposed, and I beg your pardon; but I was going to say that Mr Champfort, who saw the fracas between my lord and me, about the key and the door, the night of my lady's accident, has whispered it about at Lady Singleton's and every where -- Mrs Luttridge's maid, ma'am, who is my cousin, has pestered me with so many questions and offers, from Mrs Luttridge and Mrs Freke, of any money, if I would only tell who was in the boudoir -- and I have always answered, nobody -- and I defy them to get any thing out of me. Betray my lady! I'd sooner cut my tongue out this minute! Can she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) have such a base opinion of me, or can you, ma<div class="bookquote">``am?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``No, indeed, I am convinced that you are incapable of betraying her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), Marriott; but in all probability after you have left her (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) -- '

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If my lady would let me keep my macaw,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marriott/Mrs Marriott</b></font>)</div>interrupted Marriott, <div class="bookquote">``I should never think of leaving her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Marriott/Mrs Marriott</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The macaw she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) will not suffer to remain in the house, nor is it reasonable that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) should: it deprives her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) of sleep -- it kept her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) awake three hours this morning.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Marriott/Mrs Marriott</b></font>)</div><p/>Marriott was beginning the history of Champfort and the doors again; but Miss Portman stopped her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) by saying, <div class="bookquote">``All this is past now. How much is due to you, Mrs Marriott? Lady Delacour has commissioned me to pay you every thing that is due to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Due to me! Lord bless me, ma'am, am I to go?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly, it was your own desire -- it is consequently your lady's: she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) is perfectly sensible of your attachment to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), and of your services, but she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) cannot suffer herself to be treated with disrespect. Here are fifty guineas, which she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) gives you as a reward for your past fidelity, not as a bribe to secure your future secresy. You are at liberty, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) desires me to say, to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) secret to the whole world, if you choose to do so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Miss Portman, take my macaw -- do what you will with it -- only make my peace with my lady,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marriott/Mrs Marriott</b></font>)</div>cried Marriott, clasping her (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) hands, in an agony of grief: `here are the fifty guineas, ma'am, don't leave them with me -- I will never be disrespectful again -- take my macaw and all! No, I will carry it myself to my lady.''

<p/>Lady Delacour was surprised by the sudden entrance of Marriott, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) macaw. The chain which held the bird Marriott put into her (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) ladyship's hand without being able to say any thing more than, <div class="bookquote">``Do what you please, my lady, with it -- and with me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>ladyship</b></font>)</div><p/>Pacified by this submission, Lady Delacour granted Marriott's pardon, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) most sincerely rejoiced at this reconciliation.

<p/>The next day Belinda asked the dowager Lady Boucher, who was going to a bird-fancier's, to take her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) with her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>), in hopes that she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) might be able to meet with some bird more musical than a macaw, to console Marriott for the loss of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) screaming favourite. Lady Delacour commissioned Miss Portman to go to any price she (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) pleased. <div class="bookquote">``If I were able, I would accompany you myself, my dear, for poor Marriott's sake, though I would almost as soon go to the Augean stable.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mons</b></font>)</div><p/>There was a bird-fancier in High Holborn, who had bought several of the hundred and eighty beautiful birds, which, as the newspapers of the day advertised, had been `collected, after great labour and expense, by Mons Marten and Co. for the Republican Museum at Paris, and lately landed out of the French brig Urselle, taken on her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) voyage from Cayenne to Brest, by His (<font color='blue'><b>Marten</b></font>) Majesty's Ship Unicorn.''

<p/>When Lady Boucher and Belinda arrived at this bird-fancier's, they were long in doubt to which of the feathered beauties they should give the preference. Whilst the dowager was descanting upon their various perfections, a lady and three children came in; she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) immediately attracted Belinda's attention, by her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) likeness to Clarence Hervey's description of Lady Anne Percival -- it was Lady Anne, as Lady Boucher, who was slightly acquainted with her (<font color='blue'><b>Boucher</b></font>), informed Belinda in a whisper.

<p/>The children were soon eagerly engaged looking at the birds.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Portman,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Boucher</b></font>)</div>said Lady Boucher, `as Lady Delacour is so far from well, and wishes to have a bird that will not make any noise in the house, suppose you were to buy for Mrs Marriott this beautiful pair of green parroquets; or stay, a goldfinch is not very noisy, and here is one that can play a thousand pretty tricks. Pray, sir, make it draw up water in its little bucket for us.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, mamma!''  (<font color='red'><b>the boys</b></font>)</div>said one of the little boys, `this is the very thing that is mentioned in Bewick's History of Birds. Pray look at this goldfinch, Helena, now it is drawing up its little bucket -- but where is Helena? here's room for you, Helena.''

<p/>Whilst the little boys were looking at the goldfinch, Belinda felt somebody touch her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) gently: it was Helena Delacour.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Can I speak a few words to you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Helena/Miss Helena</b></font>)</div>said Helena.

<p/>Belinda walked to the farthest end of the shop with her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is my mamma better?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>), in a timid tone. <div class="bookquote">``I have some gold fish, which you know cannot make the least noise: may I send them to her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>)? I heard that lady call you Miss Portman: I believe you are the lady who wrote such a kind postscript to me in mamma's last letter -- that is the reason I speak so freely to you now. Perhaps you would write to tell me if mamma will see me; and Lady Anne Percival would take me at any time, I am sure -- but she (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) goes to Oakly-park in a few days. I wish I might be with mamma whilst she (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) is ill; I would not make the least noise. But don't ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>), if you think it will be troublesome -- only let me send the gold fish.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div><p/>Belinda was touched by the manner in which this affectionate little girl spoke to her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) assured her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) would say all she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) wished to her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) mother, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) begged Helena to send the gold fish whenever she (<font color='blue'><b>Helena</b></font>) pleased.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Helena/Miss Helena</b></font>)</div>said Helena, <div class="bookquote">``I will send them as soon as I go home -- as soon as I go back to Lady Anne Percival's, I mean.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Helena/Miss Helena</b></font>)</div><p/>Belinda, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) had finished speaking to Helena, heard the man who was showing the birds, lament that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had not a blue macaw, which Lady Anne Percival was commissioned to procure for Mrs. Margaret Delacour.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Red macaws, my lady, I have in abundance; but unfortunately, a blue macaw I really have not at present; nor have I been able to get one, though I have inquired amongst all the bird-fanciers in town; and I went to the auction at Haydon-square on purpose, but could not get one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div><p/>Belinda requested Lady Boucher would tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) servants to bring in the cage that contained Marriott's blue macaw; and as soon as it was brought she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) gave it to Helena, and begged that she (<font color='blue'><b>Helena</b></font>) would carry it to her (<font color='blue'><b>Helena</b></font>) Aunt Delacour. <div class="bookquote">``Lord, my dear Miss Portman,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Boucher</b></font>)</div>said Lady Boucher, drawing her (<font color='blue'><b>Boucher</b></font>) aside, <div class="bookquote">``I am afraid you will get yourself into a scrape; for Lady Delacour is not upon speaking terms with this Mrs Margaret Delacour -- she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) cannot endure her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>); you know she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) is my Lord Delacour' s aunt.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Boucher</b></font>)</div><p/>Belinda persisted in sending the macaw, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) was in hopes that these terrible family quarrels might be made up, if either party would condescend to show any disposition to oblige to other.

<p/>Lady Anne Percival understood Miss Portman's civility as it was meant.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This is a bird of good omen,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>); `it augurs family peace.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish you would do me the favour, Lady Boucher, to introduce me to Miss Portman,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Anne/Lady Anne Percival/Percival</b></font>)</div>continued Lady Anne.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The very thing I wished!''  (<font color='red'><b>Helena/Miss Helena</b></font>)</div>cried Helena.

<p/>A few minutes' conversation passed afterward upon different subjects, and Lady Anne Percival and Belinda parted with a mutual desire to see more of each other.

<p/>WHEN Belinda got home, Lady Delacour was busy in the library looking over a collection of French plays with the ci-devant Count de N--; a gentleman who possessed such singular talents for reading dramatic compositions, that many people declared that they would rather hear him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) read a play than see it performed at the theatre. Even those who were not judges of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) merit, and who had little taste for literature, crowded to hear him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>), because it was the fashion. Lady Delacour engaged him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) for a reading party at her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) house, and he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was consulting with her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) what play would be most amusing to his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) audience. <div class="bookquote">``My dear Belinda! I am glad you are come to give us your opinion,''  (<font color='red'><b>ladyship</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) ladyship; `no one has a better taste: but first I should ask you what you have done at your bird-fancier's; I hope you have brought home some horned cock, 5 or some monstrously beautiful creature for Marriott. If it has not a voice like the macaw I shall be satisfied; but even if it be the bird of paradise, I question whether Marriott will like it as well as its screaming predecessor.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) will like what is coming for her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Belinda, `and so will your ladyship; but do not let me interrupt you and monsieur le Comte.'' And as she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) spoke, she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) took up a volume of plays which lay upon the table.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nanine, or La Prude, which shall we have?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>said Lady Delacour: `or what do you think of L<div class="bookquote">``Ecossaise?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div><p/>``The scene of L``Ecossaise is laid in London,'' said Belinda; <div class="bookquote">``I should think with an English audience it would therefore be popular.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes! so it will,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>said Lady Delacour: `then let it be L``Ecossaise. M le Comte I am sure will do justice to the character of Friport the Englishman, ``qui sçait donner, mais qui ne sçait pas vivre.<div class="bookquote">'' My dear, I forgot to tell you that Clarence Hervey has been here: it is a pity you did not come a little sooner, you would have heard a charming scene of the School for Scandal read by him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>). M le Comte was quite delighted; but Clarence was in a great hurry, he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) would only give us one scene, he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) was going to Mr Percival's on business. I am sure what I told you the other day is true: but, however, he (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) has promised to come back to dine with me -- M le Comte, you will dine with us, I hope?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The count was extremely sorry that it was impossible -- he (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) was engaged. Belinda suddenly recollected that it was time to dress for dinner; but just as the count took his (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) leave, and as she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) was going up stairs, a footman met her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>), and told her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) that Mr Hervey was in the drawing-room, and wished to speak to her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>). Many conjectures were formed in Belinda's mind as she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) passed on to the drawing-room; but the moment that she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) opened the door, she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) knew the nature of Mr Hervey's business, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) saw the glass globe containing Helena Delacour's gold fishes standing on the table beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I have been commissioned to present these to you for Lady Delacour,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div>said Mr Hervey, `and I have seldom received a commission that has given me so much pleasure. I perceive that Miss Portman is indeed a real friend to Lady Delacour -- how happy she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) is to have such a friend!''

<p/>After a pause Mr Hervey went on speaking of Lady Delacour, and of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) earnest desire to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) as happy in domestic life as she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) appeared to be in public. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) frankly confessed, that when he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) was first acquainted with her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) ladyship, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) had looked upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) merely as a dissipated woman of fashion, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) had considered only his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) own amusement in cultivating her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) society: <div class="bookquote">``But,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>continued he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>), `of late I have formed a different opinion of her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) character; and I think, from what I have observed, that Miss Portman's ideas on this subject agree with mine. I had laid a plan for making her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) ladyship acquainted with Lady Anne Percival, who appears to me one of the most amiable and one of the happiest of women. Oakly-park is but a few miles from Harrowgate. -- But I am disappointed in this scheme; Lady Delacour has changed her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) mind, she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) says, and will not go there. Lady Anne, however, has just told me, that, though it is July, and though she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) loves the country, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) will most willingly stay in town a month longer, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) thinks that, with your assistance, there is some probability of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) effecting a reconciliation between Lady Delacour and her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) husband's relations, with some of whom Lady Anne is intimately acquainted. To begin with my friend, Mrs Margaret Delacour: the macaw was most graciously received, and I flatter myself that I have prepared Mrs Delacour to think somewhat more favourably of her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) niece than she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) was wont to do. All now depends upon Lady Delacour's conduct towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) daughter: if she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) continues to treat her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) with neglect, I shall be convinced that I have been mistaken in her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) character.''

<p/>Belinda was much pleased by the openness and the unaffected good-nature with which Clarence Hervey spoke, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) certainly was not sorry to hear from his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) own lips a distinct explanation of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) views and sentiments. She (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) assured him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) that no effort that she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) could make with propriety should be wanting to effect the desirable reconciliation between her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) ladyship and her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) family, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) perfectly agreed with him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) in thinking that Lady Delacour's character had been generally misunderstood by the world.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div>said Mr Hervey, `her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) connexion with that Mrs Freke hurt her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) more in the eyes of the world than she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) was aware of. It is tacitly understood by the public, that every lady goes bail for the character of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) female friends. If Lady Delacour had been so fortunate as to meet with such a friend as Miss Portman in her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) early life, what a different woman she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) would have been! She (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) once said some such thing to me herself, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) never appeared to me so amiable as at that moment.''

<p/>Mr Hervey pronounced these last words in a manner more than usually animated; and whilst he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) spoke, Belinda stooped to gather a sprig from a myrtle, which stood on the hearth. She (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) perceived that the myrtle, which was planted in a large china vase, was propped up on one side with the broken bits of Sir Philip Baddely's little stick: she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) took them up, and threw them out of the window. <div class="bookquote">``Lady Delacour stuck those fragments there this morning,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div>said Clarence smiling, `as trophies. She (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) told me of Miss Portman's victory over the heart of Sir Philip Baddely; and Miss Portman should certainly have allowed them to remain there, as indisputable evidence in favour of the baronet's taste and judgment.''

<p/>Clarence Hervey appeared under some embarrassment, and seemed to be restrained by some secret cause from laying open his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) real feelings: his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) manner varied continually. Belinda could not avoid seeing his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) perplexity -- she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) had recourse again to the gold fishes and to Helena: upon these subjects they could both speak very fluently. Lady Delacour made her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) appearance by the time that Clarence had finished repeating the Abbé Nollet's experiments, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) had heard from his (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) friend Doctor X--.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, Miss Portman, the transmission of sound in water,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div>said Clarence --

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Deep in philosophy, I protest!''  (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div>said Lady Delacour, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) came in. <div class="bookquote">``What is this about the transmission of sound in water? -- Ha! whence come these pretty gold fishes?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``These gold fishes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Belinda, `are come to console Marriott for the loss of her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) macaw.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you, my dear Belinda, for these mute comforters,''  (<font color='red'><b>ladyship</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) ladyship; `the very best things you could have chosen.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have not the merit of the choice,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Belinda, `but I am heartily glad that you approve of it.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Pretty creatures,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>said Lady Delacour: `no fish were ever so pretty since the days of the prince of the Black Islands in the Arabian Tales. And am I obliged to you, Clarence, for these subjects?''

<p/>``No; I have only had the honour of bringing them to your ladyship from -- '

<p/><div class="bookquote">``From whom? -- Amongst all my numerous acquaintance, have I one in the world who cares a gold fish about me? -- Stay, don't tell me, let me guess -- Lady Newland? -- No; you shake your heads. I guessed her (<font color='blue'><b>Newland</b></font>) ladyship, merely because I know she (<font color='blue'><b>Newland</b></font>) wants to bribe me some way or other to go to one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Newland</b></font>) stupid entertainments; she (<font color='blue'><b>Newland</b></font>) wants to pick out of me taste enough to spend a fortune. But you say it was not Lady Newland? -- Mrs Hunt then perhaps? for she (<font color='blue'><b>Hunt</b></font>) has two daughters whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Hunt</b></font>) wants me to ask to my concerts. It was not Mrs Hunt? -- Well, then, it was Mrs Masterson; for she (<font color='blue'><b>Masterson</b></font>) has a mind to go with me to Harrowgate, where, by-the-bye, I shall not go; so I won't cheat her (<font color='blue'><b>Masterson</b></font>) out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Masterson</b></font>) gold fishes; it was Mrs Masterson, hey?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No. But these little gold fishes came from a person who would be very glad to go with you to Harrowgate!''  (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div>said Clarence Hervey. <div class="bookquote">``Or who would be very glad to stay with you in town,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Belinda: `from a person who wants nothing from you but -- your love.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Male or female?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>said Lady Delacour.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Female.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Female? I have not a female friend in the world but yourself, my dear Belinda; nor do I know another female in the world, whose love I should think about for half an instant. But pray tell me the name of this unknown friend of mine, who wants nothing from me but love.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Excuse me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Belinda; <div class="bookquote">``I cannot tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) name, unless you will promise to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You have really made me impatient to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>said Lady Delacour: `but I am not able to go out, you know, yet; and with a new acquaintance, one must go through the ceremony of a morning visit. Now, en conscience, is it worth while?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well worth while,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>cried Belinda and Clarence Hervey, eagerly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, pardi! as M le Comte exclaims continually, Ah, pardi! You are both wonderfully interested in this business. It is some sister, niece, or cousin of Lady Anne Percival's; or -- no, Belinda looks as if I were wrong. Then, perhaps, it is Lady Anne herself? -- Well, take me where you please, my dear Belinda, and introduce me where you please: I depend on your taste and judgment in all things; but I really am not yet able to pay morning visits.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The ceremony of a morning visit is quite unnecessary, here,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Belinda: <div class="bookquote">``I will introduce the unknown friend to you to-morrow, if you will let me invite her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) to your reading-party.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div><p/>``With pleasure. She (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) is some charming émigrée of Clarence Hervey's acquaintance. But where did you meet with her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) this morning? You have both of you conspired to puzzle me. Take it upon yourselves, then, if this new acquaintance should not, as Ninon de l<div class="bookquote">``Enclos used to say, quit cost. If she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) be half as agreeable and graceful, Clarence, as Madame la Comtesse de Pomenars, I should not think her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) acquaintance too dearly purchased by a dozen morning visits.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Here the conversation was interrupted by a thundering knock at the door.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Whose carriage is it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>said Lady Delacour. ``Oh! Lady Newland's ostentatious livery; and here is her (<font color='blue'><b>Newland</b></font>) ladyship getting out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Newland</b></font>) carriage as awkwardly as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Newland</b></font>) had never been in one before. Overdressed, like a true city dame! Pray, Clarence, look at her (<font color='blue'><b>Newland</b></font>), entangled in her (<font color='blue'><b>Newland</b></font>) bale of gold muslin, and conscious of her (<font color='blue'><b>Newland</b></font>) bulse of diamonds! -- <div class="bookquote">``Worth, if I'm worth a farthing, five hundred thousand pounds bank currency!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) says or seems to say, whenever she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) comes into a room. Now let us see her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) entrée -- '

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>cried Lady Delacour, starting at the sight of Belinda, who was still in her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) morning dress, `absolutely below par! -- Make your escape to Marriott, I conjure you, by all your fears of the contempt of a lady, who will at the first look estimate you, au juste, to a farthing a yard.''

<p/>As she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) left the room, Belinda heard Clarence Hervey repeat to Lady Delacour

<p/>``Give me a look, give me a face,
That makes simplicity a grace;
Robes loosely flowing, hair as free -- '
he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) paused -- but Belinda recollected the remainder of the stanza --
<div class="bookquote">``Such sweet neglect more taketh me
Than all th' adulteries of art,
That strike mine eyes, but not mine heart.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>It was observed, that Miss Portman dressed herself this day with the most perfect simplicity.

<p/>Lady Delacour's curiosity was raised by the description which Belinda and Clarence Hervey had given of the new acquaintance who sent her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) the gold fishes, and who wanted nothing from her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) but her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) love.

<p/>Miss Portman told her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) that the unknown would probably come half an hour earlier to the reading-party than any of the rest of the company. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) ladyship was alone in the library, when Lady Anne Percival brought Helena, in consequence of a note from Belinda.

<p/>Miss Portman ran down stairs to the hall to receive her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>): the little girl took her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) hand in silence. <div class="bookquote">``Your mother was much pleased with the pretty gold fishes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Belinda, `and she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) will be still more pleased, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) knows that they came from you: -- she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) does not know that yet.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) is better to-day? I will not make the least noise,''  (<font color='red'><b>Helena/Miss Helena</b></font>)</div>whispered Helena, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Helena</b></font>) went up stairs on tiptoe.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You need not be afraid to make a noise -- you need not walk on tiptoe, nor shut the doors softly; for Lady Delacour seems to like all noises except the screaming of the macaw. This way, my dear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I forgot -- it is so long since! -- Is mamma up and dressed?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. She (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) has had concerts and balls since her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) illness. You will hear a play read to-night,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Belinda, `by that French gentleman whom Lady Anne Percival mentioned to me yesterday.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But there is a great deal of company, then, with mamma?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nobody is with her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) now: so come into the library with me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Belinda. <div class="bookquote">``Lady Delacour, here is the young lady who sent you the gold fishes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Helena!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>cried Lady Delacour.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You must, I am sure, acknowledge that Mr Hervey was in the right, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) said that the lady was a striking resemblance of your ladyship.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr Hervey knows how to flatter. I never had that ingenuous countenance, even in my best days: but certainly the hair of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) head is like mine -- and her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) hands and arms. But why do you tremble, Helena? Is there any thing so very terrible in the looks of your mother?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``No, only -- ,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Only what, my dear?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Only -- I was afraid -- you might not like me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who has filled your little foolish head with these vain fears? Come, simpleton, kiss me, and tell me how comes it that you are not at Oakly-hall, or -- What's the name of the place? -- Oakly-park?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Lady Anne Percival would not take me out of town, she (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) said, whilst you were ill; because she (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) thought that you might wish -- I mean she (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) thought that I should like to see you -- if you pleased.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Lady Anne is very good -- very obliging -- very considerate.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) is very good-natured,''  (<font color='red'><b>Helena/Miss Helena</b></font>)</div>said Helena.

<p/>``You love this Lady Anne Percival, I perceive.

<p/>``Oh, yes, that I do. She (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) has been so kind to me! I love her (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) were -- '

<p/><div class="bookquote">``As if she (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) were -- What? finish your sentence.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>Helena/Miss Helena</b></font>)</div>said Helena, in a low voice, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Helena</b></font>) blushed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You love her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) as well as if she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) were your mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>repeated Lady Delacour: `that is intelligible: speak intelligibly whatever you say, and never leave a sentence unfinished.''

<p/>``No, ma<div class="bookquote">``am.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing can be more ill-bred, nor more absurd; for it shows that you have the wish without the power to conceal your sentiments. Pray, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>continued Lady Delacour, `go to Oakly-park immediately -- all farther ceremony towards me may be spared.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ceremony, mamma!''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl tears</b></font>)</div>said the little girl, and the tears came into her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) eyes. Belinda sighed; and for some moments there was a dead silence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I mean only to say, Miss Portman,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>resumed Lady Delacour, `that I hate ceremony: but I know that there are people in the world who love it, who think all virtue, and all affection, depend on ceremony -- who are

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Content to dwell in decencies for ever.''
 (<font color='red'><b>people</b></font>)</div>I shall not dispute their merits. Verily, they have their reward in the good opinion and good word of all little minds, that is to say, of above half the world. I envy them not their hard-earned fame. Let ceremony curtsy to ceremony with Chinese decorum; but, when ceremony expects to be paid with affection, I beg to be excused.''
<div class="bookquote">``Ceremony sets no value upon affection, and therefore would not desire to be paid with it,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Belinda.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Never yet,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>continued Lady Delacour, pursuing the train of her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) own thoughts without attending to Belinda, `never yet was any thing like real affection won by any of these ceremonious people.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Never,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Miss Portman, looking at Helena; who, having quickness enough to perceive that her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) mother aimed this tirade against ceremony at Lady Anne Percival, sat in the most painful embarrassment, her (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) eyes cast down, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) face and neck colouring all over. <div class="bookquote">``Never yet,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Miss Portman, `did a mere ceremonious person win any thing like real affection; especially from children, who are often excellent, because unprejudiced, judges of character.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We are all apt to think, that an opinion that differs from our own is a prejudice,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>said Lady Delacour: `what is to decide?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Facts, I should think,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Belinda.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But it is so difficult to get at facts, even about the merest trifles,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>said Lady Delacour. <div class="bookquote">``Actions we see, but their causes we seldom see -- an aphorism worthy of Confucius himself: now to apply. Pray, my dear Helena, how came you by the pretty gold fishes that you were so good as to send to me yesterday?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Lady Anne Percival gave them to me, ma' am.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``And how came her (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) ladyship to give them to you, ma<div class="bookquote">``am?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) gave them to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Helena/Miss Helena</b></font>)</div>said Helena, hesitating.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You need not blush, nor repeat to me that she (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) gave them to you; that I have heard already -- that is the fact: now for the cause -- unless it be a secret. If it be a secret which you have been desired to keep, you are quite right to keep it. I make no doubt of its being necessary, according to some systems of education, that children should be taught to keep secrets; and I am convinced -LRB-for Lady Anne Percival is, I have heard, a perfect judge of propriety-RRB- that it is peculiarly proper that a daughter should know how to keep secrets from her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) mother: therefore, my dear, you need not trouble yourself to blush or hesitate any more -- I shall ask no farther questions: I was not aware that there was any secret in the case.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There is no secret in the world in the case, mamma,''  (<font color='red'><b>Helena/Miss Helena</b></font>)</div>said Helena; ``I only hesitated because -- '

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You hesitated only because, I suppose you mean. I presume Lady Anne Percival will have no objection to your speaking good English?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Helena/Miss Helena</b></font>)</div><p/>``I hesitated only because I was afraid it would not be right to praise myself. Lady Anne Percival one day asked us all -- '

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Us all?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I mean Charles, and Edward, and me, to give her (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) an account of some experiments, on the hearing of fishes, which Dr X-- had told to us: she (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) promised to give the gold fishes, of which we were all very fond, to whichever of us should give the best account of them -- Lady Anne gave the fishes to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And is this all the secret? So it was real modesty made her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) hesitate, Belinda? I beg your pardon, my dear, and Lady Anne's: you see how candid I am, Belinda. But one question more, Helena: Who put it into your head to send me your gold fishes?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nobody, mamma; no one put it into my head. But I was at the bird-fancier's yesterday, when Miss Portman was trying to get some bird for Mrs Marriott, that could not make any noise to disturb you; so I thought my fishes would be the nicest things for you in the world; because they cannot make the least noise, and they are as pretty as any birds in the world -- prettier, I think -- and I hope Mrs Marriott thinks so too.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know what Marriott thinks about the matter, but I can tell you what I think,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>said Lady Delacour, `that you are one of the sweetest little girls in the world, and that you would make me love you if I had a heart of stone, which I have not, whatever some people may think. -- Kiss me, my child!''

<p/>The little girl sprang forwards, and threw her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) arms round her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) mother, exclaiming, <div class="bookquote">``Oh, mamma, are you in earnest?''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>and she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) pressed close to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) mother's bosom, clasping her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) with all her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) force.

<p/>Lady Delacour screamed, and pushed her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) daughter away.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) is not angry with you, my love,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Belinda, `she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) is in sudden and violent pain -- don't be alarmed -- she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) will be better soon. No, don't ring the bell, but try whether you can open these window-shutters, and throw up the sash.''

<p/>Whilst Belinda was supporting Lady Delacour, and whilst Helena was trying to open the window, a servant came into the room to announce the Count de N--.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Show him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) into the drawing-room,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Belinda. Lady Delacour, though in great pain, rose and retired to her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) dressing-room. <div class="bookquote">``I shall not be able to go down to these people yet,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>); `you must make my excuses to the count and to every body; and tell poor Helena I was not angry, though I pushed her (<font color='blue'><b>Helena</b></font>) away. Keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Helena</b></font>) below stairs: I will come as soon as I am able. Send Marriott. Do not forget, my dear, to tell Helena I was not angry.''

<p/>The reading-party went on, and Lady Delacour made her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) appearance as the company were drinking orgeat, between the fourth and fifth act. <div class="bookquote">``Helena, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>), `will you bring me a glass of orgeat?''

<p/>Clarence Hervey looked at Belinda with a congratulatory smile: `do not you think,'' whispered he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>), `that we shall succeed? Did you see that look of Lady Delacour<div class="bookquote">``s?''

 (<font color='red'><b>people</b></font>)</div><p/>Nothing tends more to increase the esteem and affection of two people for each other than their having one and the same benevolent object. Clarence Hervey and Belinda seemed to know one another's thoughts and feelings this evening better than they had ever done before during the whole course of their acquaintance.

<p/>After the play was over, most of the company went away; only a select party of beaux esprits stayed to supper; they were standing at the table at which the count had been reading: several volumes of French plays and novels were lying there, and Clarence Hervey, taking up one of them, cried, <div class="bookquote">``Come, let us try our fate by the Sortes Virgilianæ.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div><p/>Lady Delacour opened the book, which was a volume of Marmontel's Tales.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``La femme comme il y en a peu!''  (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Hervey.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who will ever more have faith in the Sortes Virgilianæ?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>said Lady Delacour, laughing; but whilst she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) laughed she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) went closer to a candle, to read the page which she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) had opened. Belinda and Clarence Hervey followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Really, it is somewhat singular, Belinda, that I should have opened upon this passage,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>continued she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>), in a low voice, pointing it out to Miss Portman.

<p/>It was a description of the manner in which la femme comme il y en a peu managed a husband, who was excessively afraid of being thought to be governed by his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) wife. As her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) ladyship turned over the page, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) saw a leaf of myrtle which Belinda, who had been reading the story the preceding day, had put into the book for a mark.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Whose mark is this? Yours, Belinda, I am sure, by its elegance,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>said Lady Delacour. <div class="bookquote">``So! this is a concerted plan between you two, I see,''  (<font color='red'><b>ladyship</b></font>)</div>continued her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) ladyship, with an air of pique: `you have contrived prettily de me dire des vérités! One says, <div class="bookquote">``Let us try our fate by the Sortes Virgilianæ;''  (<font color='red'><b>the child</b></font>)</div>the other has dexterously put a mark in the book, to make it open upon a lesson for the naughty child.''

<p/>Belinda and Mr Hervey assured her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) that they had used no such mean arts, that nothing had been concerted between them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How came this leaf of myrtle here, then?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>said Lady Delacour.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I was reading that story yesterday, and left it as my mark.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I cannot help believing you, because you never yet deceived me, even in the merest trifle: you are truth itself, Belinda. Well, you see that you were the cause of my drawing such an extraordinary lot; the book would not have opened here but for your mark. My fate, I find, is in your hands: if Lady Delacour is ever to be la femme comme il y en a peu, which is the most improbable thing in the world, Miss Portman will be the cause of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Which is the most probable thing in the world,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div>said Clarence Hervey. <div class="bookquote">``This myrtle has a delightful perfume,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>added he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>), rubbing the leaf between his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) fingers.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But, after all,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>said Lady Delacour, throwing aside the book, <div class="bookquote">``This heroine of Marmontel's is not la femme comme il y en a peu, but la femme comme il n'y en a point.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mrs Margaret Delacour's carriage, my lady, for Miss Delacour,''  (<font color='red'><b>a footman</b></font>)</div>said a footman to her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) ladyship.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Helena stays with me to-night -- my compliments,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>said Lady Delacour.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How pleased the little gipsy looks!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>added she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>), turning to Helena, who heard the message; `and how handsome she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) looks when she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) is pleased! -- Do these auburn locks of yours, Helena, curl naturally or artificially?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Naturally, mamma.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Naturally! so much the better: so did mine at your age.''  (<font color='red'><b>Helena/Miss Helena</b></font>)</div>Some of the company now took notice of the astonishing resemblance between Helena and her (<font color='blue'><b>Helena</b></font>) mother; and the more Lady Delacour considered her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) daughter as part of herself, the more she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) was inclined to be pleased with her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>). The glass globe containing the gold fishes was put in the middle of the table at supper; and Clarence Hervey never paid her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) ladyship such respectful attention in his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) life as he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) did this evening.

<p/>The conversation at supper turned upon a magnificent and elegant entertainment which had lately been given by a fashionable duchess, and some of the company spoke in high terms of the beauty and accomplishments of her (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) grace's daughter, who had for the first time appeared in public on that occasion.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The daughter will eclipse, totally eclipse, the mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>said Lady Delacour. <div class="bookquote">``That total eclipse has been foretold by many knowing people,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div>said Clarence Hervey; `but how can there be an eclipse between two bodies which never cross one another? and that I understand to be the case between the duchess and her (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) daughter.''

<p/>This observation seemed to make a great impression upon Lady Delacour. Clarence Hervy went on, and with much eloquence expressed his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervy</b></font>) admiration of the mother who had stopped short in the career of dissipation to employ her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) inimitable talents in the education of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) children; who had absolutely brought virtue into fashion by the irresistible powers of wit and beauty.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Really, Clarence,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>said Lady Delacour, rising from the table, `vous parlez avec beaucoup d'onction. I advise you to write a sentimental comedy, a comédie larmoyante, or a drama on the German model, and call it The School for Mothers, and beg her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) grace of -- to sit for your heroine.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your ladyship, surely, would not be so cruel as to send a faithful servant a begging for a heroine?''  (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div>said Clarence Hervey.

<p/>Lady Delacour smiled at first at the compliment, but a few minutes afterwards she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) signed bitterly. <div class="bookquote">``It is too late for me to think of being a heroine,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Too late?''  (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div>cried Hervey, following her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) eagerly as she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) walked out of the super-room; `to late? Her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) grace of -- is some years older than your ladyship.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I did not mean to say too late,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>said Lady Delacour; `but let us go on to something else. Why were you not at the fête champêtre the other day? and where were you all this morning? And pray can you tell me when your friend doctor X-- returns to town?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr Horton is getting better,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div>said Clarence, `and I hope that we shall have Dr. X-- soon amongst us again. I hear that he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) is to be in town in the course of a few days.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Did he (<font color='blue'><b>Horton</b></font>) inquire for me? -- Did he (<font color='blue'><b>Horton</b></font>) ask how I did?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No. I fancy he (<font color='blue'><b>Horton</b></font>) took it for granted that your ladyship was quite well; for I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Horton</b></font>) you were getting better every day, and that you were in charming spirits.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>said Lady Delacour, `but I wear myself out with these charming spirits. I am very nervous still, I assure you, and sitting up late is not good for me: so I shall wish you and all the world a good night. You see I am absolutely a reformed rake.''

<p/>CHAPTER XIV

<p/>The Exhibition

<p/>TWO hours after her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) ladyship had retired to her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) room, as Belinda was passing by the door to go to her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) own bedchamber, she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) heard Lady Delacour call to her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Belinda, you need not walk so softly; I am not asleep. Come in, will you, my dear? I have something of consequence to say to you. Is all the world gone?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; and I thought that you were asleep. I hope you are not in pain.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not just at present, thank you; but that was a terrible embrace of poor little Helena's. You see to what accidents I should be continually exposed, if I had that child always about me; and yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Helena</b></font>) seems of such an affectionate disposition, that I wish it were possible to keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Helena</b></font>) at home. Sit down by my bedside, my dear Belinda, and I will tell you what I have resolved upon.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div><p/>Belinda sat down, and Lady Delacour was silent for some minutes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am resolved,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>), `to make one desperate effort for my life. New plans, new hopes of happiness, have opened to my imagination, and, with my hopes of being happy, my courage rises. I am determined to submit to the dreadful operation which alone can radically cure me -- you understand me; but it must be kept a profound secret, I know of a person who could be got to perform this operation with the utmost secrecy.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But, surely,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Belinda, `safety must be your first object!''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, secrecy is my first object. Nay, do not reason with me; it is a subject on which I cannot, will not, reason. Hear me, -- I will keep Helena with me for a few days; she (<font color='blue'><b>Helena</b></font>) was surprised by what passed in the library this evening -- I must remove all suspicion from her (<font color='blue'><b>Helena</b></font>) mind.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There is no suspicion in her (<font color='blue'><b>Helena</b></font>) mind,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Belinda.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So much the better: she (<font color='blue'><b>Helena</b></font>) shall go immediately to school, or to Oakly-park. I will then stand my trial for life or death; and if I live I will be, what I have never yet been, a mother to Helena. If I die, you and Clarence Hervey will take care of her (<font color='blue'><b>Helena</b></font>); I know you will. That young man is worthy of you, Belinda. If I die, I charge you to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) that I knew his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) value; that I had a soul capable of being touched by the eloquence of virtue.''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>Lady Delacour, after a pause, said, in an altered tone, <div class="bookquote">``Do you think, Belinda, that I shall survive this operation?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The opinion of Dr. X--,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Belinda, `must certainly be more satisfactory than mine;' and she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) repeated what the doctor had left with her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) in writing upon this subject. <div class="bookquote">``You see,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Belinda, `that Dr. X-- is by no means certain that you have the complaint which you dread.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am certain of it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>said Lady Delacour, with a deep sigh. Then, after a pause, she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) resumed: ``So it is the doctor's opinion, that I shall inevitably destroy myself if, from a vain hope of secrecy, I put myself into ignorant hands? These are his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) own words, are they? Very strong; and he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) is prudent to leave that opinion in writing. Now, whatever happens, he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) cannot be answerable for ``measures which he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) does not guide;<div class="bookquote">'' nor you either, my dear; you have done all that is prudent and proper. But I must beg you to recollect, that I am neither a child nor a fool; that I am come to years of discretion, and that I am not now in the delirium of a fever; consequently, there can be no pretense for managing me. In this particular I must insist upon managing myself. I have confidence in the skill of the person whom I shall employ: Dr X--, very likely, would have none, because the man may not have a diploma for killing or curing in form. That is nothing to the purpose. It is I that am to undergo the operation: it is my health, my life, that is risked; and if I am satisfied, that is enough. Secrecy, as I told you before, is my first object.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And cannot you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Belinda, `depend with more security upon the honour of a surgeon who is at the head of his (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) profession, and who has a high reputation at stake, than upon a vague promise of secrecy from some obscure quack, who has no reputation to lose?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>said Lady Delacour: ``I tell you, my dear, that I cannot depend upon any of these ``honourable men.<div class="bookquote">'' I have taken means to satisfy myself on this point: their honour and foolish delicacy would not allow them to perform such an operation for a wife, without the knowledge, privity, consent &c. &c. &c. of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) husband. Now Lord Delacour's knowing the thing is quite out of the question.''

 (<font color='red'><b>these men</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, my dear Lady Delacour, why?''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Belinda, with great earnestness. <div class="bookquote">``Surely a husband has the strongest claim to be consulted upon such an occasion! Let me entreat you to tell Lord Delacour your intention, and then all will be right. Say Yes, my dear friend! let me prevail upon you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Belinda, taking her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) ladyship's hand, and pressing it between both of hers with the most affectionate eagerness.

<p/>Lady Delacour made no answer, but fixed her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) eyes upon Belinda's.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Lord Delacour,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>continued Miss Portman, `deserves this from you, by the great interest, the increasing interest, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) has shown of late about your health: his (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) kindness and handsome conduct the other morning certainly pleased you, and you have now an opportunity of showing that confidence in him (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>), which his (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) affection and constant attachment to you merit.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I trouble myself very little about the constancy of Lord Delacour's attachment to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>ladyship</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) ladyship coolly, withdrawing her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) hand from Belinda; `whether his (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) lordship's affection for me has of late increased or diminished, is an object of perfect indifference to me. But if I were inclined to reward him (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) for his (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) late attentions, I should apprehend that we might hit upon some better reward than you have pitched upon. Unless you imagine that Lord Delacour has a peculiar taste for surgical operations, I cannot conceive how his (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) becoming my confidant upon this occasion could have an immediate tendency to increase his (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) affection for me -- about which affection I don't care a straw, as you, better than any one else, must know; for I am no hypocrite. I have laid open my whole heart to you, Belinda.''

<p/>``For that very reason', said Miss Portman, <div class="bookquote">``I am eager to use the influence which I know I have in your heart for your happiness. I am convinced that it will be absolutely impossible that you should carry on this scheme in the house with your husband without its being discovered. If he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) discover it by accident, he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) will feel very differently from what he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) would do if he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) were trusted by you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``For Heaven's sake, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>cried Lady Delacour, `let me hear no more about Lord Delacour's feelings.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But allow me then to speak of my own,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Belinda: <div class="bookquote">``I cannot be concerned in this affair, if it is to be concealed from your husband.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You will do about that as you think proper,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>said Lady Delacour haughtily. <div class="bookquote">``Your sense of propriety towards Lord Delacour is, I observe, stronger than your sense of honour towards me. But I make no doubt that you act upon principle -- just principle. You promised never to abandon me; but when I most want your assistance, you refuse it, from consideration for Lord Delacour. A scruple of delicacy absolves a person of nice feelings, I find, from a positive promise -- a new and convenient code of morality!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div><p/>Belinda, though much hurt by the sarcastic tone in which her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) ladyship spoke, mildly answered, that the promise she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) had made to stay with her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) ladyship during her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) illness was very different from an engagement to assist her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) in such a scheme as she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) had now in contemplation.

<p/>Lady Delacour suddenly drew the curtain between her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) and Belinda, saying, <div class="bookquote">``Well, my dear, at all events, I am glad to hear you don't forget your promise of staying with me. You are, perhaps, prudent to refuse me your assistance, all circumstances considered. Good night: I have kept you up too long -- good night!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good night!''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Belinda, drawing aside the curtain. <div class="bookquote">``You will not be displeased with me, when you reflect coolly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The light blinds me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>said Lady Delacour; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) face away from Miss Portman, and added, in a drowsy voice, <div class="bookquote">``I will think of what has been said some time or other: but just now I would rather go to sleep than say or hear any more; for I am more than half asleep already.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div><p/>Belinda closed the curtains and left the room. But Lady Delacour, notwithstanding the drowsy tone in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) pronounced these last words, was not in the least inclined to sleep. A passion had taken possession of her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) mind, which kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) broad awake the remainder of the night -- the passion of jealousy. The extreme eagerness with which Belinda had urged her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) to consult Lord Delacour, and to trust him (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) with her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) secret, displeased her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>); not merely as an opposition to her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) will, and undue attention to his (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) lordship's feelings, but as `confirmation strong' of a hint which had been dropped by Sir Philip Baddely, but which never till now had appeared to be worthy of a moment's consideration. Sir Philip had observed, that, `if a young lady had any hopes of being a viscountess, it was no wonder she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) thought a baronet beneath her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) notice.'' ``Now,<div class="bookquote">'' thought Lady Delacour, `this is not impossible. In the first place, Belinda Portman is niece to Mrs Stanhope; she (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) may have all her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) aunt's art, and the still greater art to conceal it under the mask of openness and simplicity: Volto sciolto, pensieri stretti, is the grand maxim of the Stanhope school.''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>The moment Lady Delacour's mind turned to suspicion, her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) ingenuity rapidly supplied her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) with circumstances and arguments to confirm and justify her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) doubts.

<p/>``Miss Portman fears that my husband is growing too fond of me: she (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) says, he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) has been very attentive to me of late. Yes, so he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) has; and on purpose to disgust him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) with me, she (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) immediately urges me to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) that I have a loathsome disease, and that I am about to undergo a horrid operation. How my eyes have been blinded by her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) artifice! This last stroke was rather too bold, and has opened them effectually, and now I see a thousand things that escaped me before. Even to-night, the Sortes Virgilianæ, the myrtle leaf, Miss Portman's mark, left in the book exactly at the place where Marmontel gives a recipt for managing a husband of Lord Delacour's character. Ah, ah! By her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) own confession, she (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) had been reading this: studying it. Yes, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) has studied it to some purpose; she (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) has made that poor weak lord of mine think her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) an angel. How he (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) ran on in her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) praise the other day, when he (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) honoured me with a morning visit! That morning visit, too, was of her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) suggestion; and the bank-notes, as he (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>), like a simpleton, let out in the course of the conversation, had been offered to her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) first. She (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>), with a delicacy that charmed my short-sighted folly, begged that they might go through my hands. How artfully managed! Mrs Stanhope herself could not have done better. So, she (<font color='blue'><b>Stanhope</b></font>) can make Lord Delacour do whatever she (<font color='blue'><b>Stanhope</b></font>) pleases; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Stanhope</b></font>) condescends to make him (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) behave prettily to me, and desires him (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) to bring me peace-offerings of bank-notes. She (<font color='blue'><b>Stanhope</b></font>) is, in fact, become my banker; mistress of my house, my husband, and myself. Ten days I have been confined to my room. Truly, she (<font color='blue'><b>Stanhope</b></font>) has made a good use of her (<font color='blue'><b>Stanhope</b></font>) time: and I, fool that I am, have been thanking her (<font color='blue'><b>Stanhope</b></font>) for all her (<font color='blue'><b>Stanhope</b></font>) disinterested kindness!

<p/>``Then her (<font color='blue'><b>Stanhope</b></font>) attention to my daughter! disinterested, too, as I thought! -- But, good Heavens, what an idiot I have been! She (<font color='blue'><b>Stanhope</b></font>) looks forward to be the step-mother of Helena; she (<font color='blue'><b>Helena</b></font>) would win the simple child's affections even before my face, and show Lord Delacour what a charming wife and mother she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) would make! He (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) said some such thing to me, as well as I remember, the other day. Then her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) extreme prudence! She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) never coquets, not she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), with any of the young men who come here on purpose to see her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). Is this natural? Absolutely unnatural -- artifice! artifice! To contrast herself with me in Lord Delacour's opinion is certainly her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) object. Even to Clarence Hervey, with whom she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was, or pretended to be, smitten, how cold and reserved she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) is grown of late; and how haughtily she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) rejected my advice, when I hinted that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was not taking the way to win him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>)! I could not comprehend her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had no designs on Clarence Hervey, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) assured me. Immaculate purity! I believe you.

<p/>``Then her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) refusal to Sir Philip Baddely! -- a baronet with fifteen thousand a year to be refused by a girl who has nothing, and merely because he (<font color='blue'><b>Baddely</b></font>) is a fool! How could I be such a fool as to believe it? Worthy niece of Mrs Stanhope, I know you now! And now I recollect that extraordinary letter of Mrs Stanhope's which I snatched out of Miss Portman's hands some months ago, full of blanks, and innuendoes, and references to some letter which Belinda had written about my disputes with my husband! From that moment to this, Miss Portman has never let me see another of her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) aunt's letters. So I may conclude they are all in the same style; and I make no doubt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) has instructed her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) niece, all this time, how to proceed. Now I know why she (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) always puts Mrs Stanhope's letters into her (<font color='blue'><b>Stanhope</b></font>) pocket the moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Stanhope</b></font>) receives them, and never opens them in my presence. And I have been laying open my whole heart, telling my whole history, confessing all my faults and follies, to this girl! And I have told her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) that I am dying! I have taught her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) to look forward with joy and certainty to the coronet, on which she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) has fixed her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) heart.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``On my knees I conjured her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) to stay with me to receive my last breath. Oh, dupe, miserable dupe, that I am! could nothing warn me? In the moment that I discovered the treachery of one friend, I went and prostrated myself to the artifices of another -- of another a thousand times more dangerous -- ten thousand times more beloved! For what was Harriot Freke in comparison with Belinda Portman? Harriot Freke, even whilst she (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) diverted me most, I half despised. But Belinda! -- Oh, Belinda! how entirely have I loved -- trusted -- admired -- adored -- respected -- revered you!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Exhausted by the emotions to which she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) had worked herself up by the force of her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) powerful imagination, Lady Delacour, after passing several restless hours in bed, fell asleep late in the morning; and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) awaked, Belinda was standing by her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) bedside. <div class="bookquote">``What could you be dreaming of?''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Belinda, smiling. <div class="bookquote">``You started, and looked at me with such horror, when you opened your eyes, as if I had been your evil genius.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div><p/>It is not in human nature, thought Lady Delacour, suddenly overcome by the sweet smile and friendly tone of Belinda, it is not in human nature to be so treacherous; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) stretched out both her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) arms to Belinda, saying, <div class="bookquote">``You my evil genius? No. My guardian angel, my dearest Belinda, kiss me, and forgive me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Forgive you for what?''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Belinda; <div class="bookquote">``I believe you are dreaming still, and I am sorry to awaken you; but I am come to tell you a wonderful thing -- that Lord Delacour is up, and dressed, and actually in the breakfast-room; and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) has been talking to me this half hour -- of what do you think? -- of Helena. He (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) was quite surprised, he (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) said, to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Helena</b></font>) grown such a fine girl, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) declares that he (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) no longer regrets that she (<font color='blue'><b>Helena</b></font>) was not a boy; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) says that he (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) will dine at home to-day, on purpose to drink Helena's health in his (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) new burgundy; and, in short, I never saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) in such good spirits, or so agreeable: I always thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) was one of the best-natured men I had ever seen. Will not you get up to breakfast? Lord Delacour has asked for you ten times within these five minutes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>said Lady Delacour, rubbing her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) eyes. <div class="bookquote">``All this is vastly wonderful; but I wish you had not awakened me so soon.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, nay,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Belinda, <div class="bookquote">``I know by the tone of your voice, that you do not mean what you say; I know you will get up, and come down to us directly -- so I will send Marriott.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div><p/>Lady Delacour got up, and went down to breakfast, in much uncertainty what to think of Miss Portman; but ashamed to let her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) into her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) mind, and still more afraid that Lord Delacour should suspect her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) of doing him (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) the honour to be jealous. Belinda had not the least guess of what was really passing in her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) ladyship's heart; she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) implicitly believed her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) expressions of complete indifference to her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) lord; and jealousy was the last feeling which Miss Portman would have attributed to Lady Delacour, because she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) unfortunately was not sufficiently aware that jealousy can exist without love. The idea of Lord Delacour as an object of attachment, or of a coronet as an object of ambition, or of her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) friend's death as an object of joy, were so foreign to Belinda's innocent mind, that it was scarcely possible she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) could decipher Lady Delacour's thoughts. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) ladyship affected to be in `remarkable good spirits this morning,'' declared that she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) had never felt so well since her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) illness, ordered her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) carriage as soon as breakfast was over, and said she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) would take Helena to Maillardet's, to see the wonders of his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) little conjuror and his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) singing-bird. <div class="bookquote">``Nothing equal to Maillardet's singing-bird has ever been seen or heard of, my dear Helena, since the days of Aboulcasem's peacock in the Persian Tales. Since Lady Anne Percival has not shown you these charming things, I must.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I hope you won't tire yourself, mamma,''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>said the little girl.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm afraid you will,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Belinda. <div class="bookquote">``And you know, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Delacour</b></font>)</div>added Lord Delacour, `that Miss Portman, who is so very obliging and good-natured, could go just as well with Helena; and I am sure, would, rather than that you should tire yourself, or give yourself an unnecessary trouble.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Portman is very good,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>answered Lady Delacour, hastily; `but I think it no unnecessary trouble to give my daughter any pleasure in my power. As to its tiring me, I am neither dead, nor dying, yet; for the rest, Miss Portman, who understands what is proper, blushes for you, as you see, my lord, when you propose that she (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>), who is not yet a married woman, should chaperon a young lady. It is quite out of rule; and Mrs Stanhope would be shocked if her (<font color='blue'><b>Stanhope</b></font>) niece could, or would, do such a thing to oblige any body.''

<p/>Lord Delacour was too much in the habit of hearing sarcastic, and to him (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) incomprehensible speeches from her (<font color='blue'><b>Stanhope</b></font>) ladyship, to take any extraordinary notice of this; and if Belinda blushed, it was merely from the confusion into which she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) was thrown by the piercing glance of Lady Delacour's black eyes -- a glance which neither guilt nor innocence could withstand. Belinda imagined that her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) ladyship still retained some displeasure from the conversation that had passed the preceding night, and the first time that she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) was alone with Lady Delacour, she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) again touched upon the subject, in hopes of softening or convincing her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``At all events, my dear friend,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>), `you will not, I hope, be offended by the sincerity with which I speak -- I can have no object but your safety and happiness.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sincerity never offends me,''  (<font color='red'><b>ladyship</b></font>)</div>was her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) ladyship's cold answer. And all the time that they were out together, she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) was unusually ceremonious to Miss Portman; and there would have been but little conversation, if Helena had not been present, to whom her (<font color='blue'><b>Helena</b></font>) mother talked with fluent gaiety. When they got to Spring Gardens, Helena exclaimed, <div class="bookquote">``Oh! there's Lady Percival's carriage, and Charles and Edward with her (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) -- they are going to the same place that we are, I dare say, for I heard Charles ask Lady Anne to take him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) to see Maillardet's little bird -- Mr Hervey mentioned it to us, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) said it was a curious piece of machinery.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Helena/Miss Helena</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish you had told me sooner that Lady Anne was likely to be there -- I don't wish to meet her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) so awkwardly: I am not well enough yet, indeed, to go to these odious, hot, close places; and, besides, I hate seeing sights.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Helena/Miss Helena</b></font>)</div><p/>Helena, with much good humour, said that she (<font color='blue'><b>Helena</b></font>) would rather give up seeing the sight than be troublesome to her (<font color='blue'><b>Helena</b></font>) mother. When they came to Maillardet's, however, Lady Delacour saw Mrs -- getting out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) carriage, and to her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) consigned Helena and Miss Portman, saying that she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) would take a turn or two in the park, and call for them in half an hour. When the half hour was over, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) ladyship returned, she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) carelessly asked, as they were going home, whether they had been pleased with their visit to the bird and the conjuror. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes mamma!''  (<font color='red'><b>Helena/Miss Helena</b></font>)</div>said Helena: `and do you know, that one of the questions that the people ask the conjuror, is Where is the happiest family to be found? And Charles and Edward immediately said, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) is a good conjuror, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) tells truth, he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)'ll answer, <div class="bookquote">``At Oakly-park.'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Portman, had you any conversation with Lady Anne Percival?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>said Lady Delacour, coldly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A great deal,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Belinda, `and such as I am sure you would have liked: and so far from being a ceremonious person, I think I never saw any body who had such easy engaging manners.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And did she (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) ask you, Helena, again to go with her (<font color='blue'><b>Helena</b></font>) to that place where the happiest family in the world is to be found?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oakly-park? -- No, mamma; she (<font color='blue'><b>Helena</b></font>) said that she (<font color='blue'><b>Helena</b></font>) was very glad that I was with you; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Helena</b></font>) asked Miss Portman to come to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) whenever it was in her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) power.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And could Miss Portman withstand such a temptation?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You know that I am engaged to your ladyship,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Belinda.

<p/>Lady Delacour bowed. <div class="bookquote">``But from what passed last night,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``I was afraid that you might repent your engagement to me: and if so, I give up my bond. I should be miserable if I apprehended that any one, but more especially Miss Portman, felt herself a prisoner in my house.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear Lady Delacour! I do not feel myself a prisoner; I have always till now felt myself a friend in your house; but we'll talk of this another time. Do not look at me with so much coldness; do not speak to me so with so much politeness. I will not let you forget that I am your friend.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not wish to forget it, Belinda,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>said Lady Delacour, with emotion; <div class="bookquote">``I am not ungrateful, though I may seem capricious -- bear with me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There now, you look like yourself again, and I am satisfied,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>cried Belinda. <div class="bookquote">``As to going to Oakly-park, I give you my word I have not the most distant thoughts of it. I stay with you from choice, and not from compulsion, believe me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do believe you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>said Lady Delacour; and for a moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) was convinced that Belinda stayed with her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) for her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) own sake alone; but the next minute she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) suspected that Lord Delacour was the secret cause of her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) refusing to go to Oakly-park. His (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) lordship dined at home this day, and two or three succeeding days, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) was not intoxicated from Monday till Thursday. These circumstances appeared to his (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) lady very extraordinary. In fact, he (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) was pleased and amused with his (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) little daughter, Helena; and whilst she (<font color='blue'><b>Helena</b></font>) was yet almost a stranger to him (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) wished to appear to her (<font color='blue'><b>Helena</b></font>) in the most agreeable and respectable light possible. One day after dinner, Lord Delacour, who was in a remarkable good humour, said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Helena</b></font>) ladyship, <div class="bookquote">``My dear, you know that your new carriage was broken almost to pieces the night when you were overturned. Well, I have had it all set to rights again, and new painted, and it is all complete, except for hammer-cloth, which must have new fringe. What colour will you have the fringe?''

 (<font color='red'><b>ladyship</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you say, Miss Portman?''  (<font color='red'><b>ladyship</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Helena</b></font>) ladyship.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Black and orange would look well, I think,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Belinda, `and would suit the lace of your liveries -- would not it?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly: black and orange then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Delacour</b></font>)</div>said Lord Delacour, `it shall be.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you ask my opinion,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>said Lady Delacour, <div class="bookquote">``I am for blue and white, to match the cloth of the liveries.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Blue and white then it shall be,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Delacour</b></font>)</div>said Lord Delacour.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, Miss Portman has a better taste than I have; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) says black and orange, my lord.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then you'll have it black and orange, will you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Delacour</b></font>)</div>said Lord Delacour.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Just as you please,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>said Lady Delacour, and no more passed.

<p/>Soon afterward a note came from Lady Anne Percival, with some trifles belonging to Helena, for which her (<font color='blue'><b>Helena</b></font>) mother had sent. The note was for Belinda -- another pressing invitation to Oakly-park -- and a very civil message from Mrs Margaret Delacour, and thanks to Lady Delacour for the macaw. Ay, thought Lady Delacour, Miss Portman wants to ingratiate herself in time with all my husband's relations. <div class="bookquote">``Mrs Margaret Delacour should have addressed these thanks to you, Miss Portman for I had not the grace to think of sending her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) the macaw.''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Delacour</b></font>)</div>Lord Delacour, who was very fond of his (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) aunt, immediately joined his (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) thanks, and observed that Miss Portman was always considerate -- always obliging -- always kind. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) drank her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) health in a bumper of burgundy, and insisted upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) little Helena's drinking her (<font color='blue'><b>Helena</b></font>) health. <div class="bookquote">``I am sure you ought, my dear, for Miss Portman is very good -- too good to you, child.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very good -- not too good, I hope.''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>said Lady Delacour. <div class="bookquote">``Miss Portman, your health.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And I hope,''  (<font color='red'><b>lordship</b></font>)</div>continued his (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) lordship, after swallowing his (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) bumper, `that my Lady Anne Percival does not mean to inveigle you away from us, Miss Portman. You don't think of leaving us, Miss Portman, I hope? Here's Helena would break her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) little heart; -- I say nothing for my Lady Delacour, because she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) can say every thing so much better for herself; and I say nothing for myself, because I am the worst man in the world at making speeches, when I really have a thing at heart -- as I have your staying with us, Miss Portman.''

<p/>Belinda assured him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) that there was no occasion to press her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) to do what was perfectly agreeable to her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>), and said that she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) had no thoughts of leaving Lady Delacour. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) ladyship, with some embarrassment, expressed herself `extremely obliged, and gratified, and happy.'' Helena, with artless joy, threw her (<font color='blue'><b>Helena</b></font>) arms about Belinda, and exclaimed, <div class="bookquote">``I am glad you are not going; for I never liked any body so much, of whom I knew so little.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The more you know of Miss Portman, the more you will like her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>), child -- at least I have found it so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Delacour</b></font>)</div>said Lord Delacour.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Clarence Hervey would, I am sure, have given the Pigot diamond, if it were in his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) gift, for such a smile as you bestowed on Lord Delacour just now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>whispered Lady Delacour. For an instant Belinda was struck with the tone of pique and reproach, in which her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) ladyship spoke. <div class="bookquote">``Nay, my dear, I did not mean to make you blush so piteously,''  (<font color='red'><b>ladyship</b></font>)</div>pursued her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) ladyship: <div class="bookquote">``I really did not think it a blushing matter -- but you know best. Believe me, I spoke without malice; we are so apt to judge from our own feelings -- and I could as soon blush about the old man of the mountains as about my Lord Delacour.''

 (<font color='red'><b>ladyship</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Lord Delacour!''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Belinda, with a look of such unfeigned surprise, that her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) ladyship instantly changed countenance, and, taking her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) hand with gaiety, said, <div class="bookquote">``So, my little Belinda, I have caught you -- the blush belongs then to Clarence Hervey? Well, any man of common sense would rather have one blush than a thousand smiles for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) share: now we understand one another. And will you go with me to the exhibition to-morrow? I am told there are some charming pictures this year. Helena, who really has a genius for drawing, should see these things; and whilst she (<font color='blue'><b>Helena</b></font>) is with me, I will make her (<font color='blue'><b>Helena</b></font>) as happy as possible. You see the reformation is beginning -- Clarence Hervey and Miss Portman can do wonders. If it be my fate, at last, to be la bonne mère, or la femme comme il y en a peu, how can I help it? There is no struggling against fate, my dear!''

 (<font color='red'><b>ladyship</b></font>)</div><p/>Whenever Lady Delacour's suspicions of Belinda were suspended, all her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) affections returned with double force; she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) wondered at her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) own folly, she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) was ashamed that she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) could have let such ideas enter her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) mind, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) was beyond measure astonished that any thing relative to Lord Delacour could so far have interested her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) attention. <div class="bookquote">``Luckily,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) to herself, `he (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) has not the penetration of a blind beetle; and, besides, he (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) has little snug jealousies of his (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) own; so he (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) will never find me out. It would be an excellent thing indeed, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) were to turn my `master-torment ' against myself -- it would be a judgment upon me. The manes of poor Lawless would then be appeased. But it is impossible I should ever be a jealous wife: I am only a jealous friend, and I must satisfy myself about Belinda. To be a second time a dupe to the treachery of a friend would be too much for me -- too much for my pride -- too much for my heart.''

<p/>The next day, when they came to the exhibition, Lady Delacour had an opportunity of judging of Belinda's real feelings. As they went up the stairs, they heard the voices of Sir Philip Baddely and Mr Rochfort, who were standing upon the landing-place, leaning over the banisters, and running their little sticks along the iron rails, to try which could make the loudest noise.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you been much pleased with the pictures, gentlemen?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>said Lady Delacour, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) passed them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, damme! no -- `tis a cursed bore; and yet there some fine pictures: one in particular -- hey, Rochfort? -- one damned fine picture!''  (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Philip Baddely</b></font>)</div>said Sir Philip. And the two gentlemen laughing significantly, followed Lady Delacour and Belinda into the rooms.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, there's one picture that's worth all the rest, `pon honour!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>repeated Rochfort; `and we'll leave it to your ladyship's and Miss Portman's taste and judgment to find it out, mayn't we Sir Philip?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, damme! yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Philip Baddely</b></font>)</div>said Sir Philip, `by all means.'' But he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) was so impatient to direct her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) eyes, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) could not keep himself still an instant.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, curse it! Rochfort, we'd better tell the ladies at once, else they may be all day looking and looking!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, Sir Philip, may not I be allowed to guess? Must I be told which is your fine picture? -- This is not much in favour of my taste.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, damn it! Your ladyship has the best taste in the world, every body knows; and so has Miss Portman -- and this picture will hit her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) taste particularly, I'm sure. It is Clarence Hervey's fancy; but this is a dead secret -- dead -- Clary no more thinks that we know it, than the man in the moon.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Clarence Hervey's fancy! Then I make no doubt of its being good for something,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>said Lady Delacour, `if the painter have done justice to his (<font color='blue'><b>painter</b></font>) imagination; for Clarence has really a fine imagination.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, damme! `tis not amongst the history pieces,''  (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Philip Baddely</b></font>)</div>cried Sir Philip, <div class="bookquote">''tis a portrait.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Philip Baddely</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And a history piece, too, `pon honour!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Rochfort: 'a family history piece, I take it, `pon honour! It will turn out,<div class="bookquote">'' said Rochfort; and both the gentlemen were, or affected to be, thrown into convulsions of laughter, as they repeated the words, `family history piece, `pon honour! -- family history piece, damme!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll take my oath as to the portrait's being a devilish good likeness,''  (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Philip Baddely</b></font>)</div>said Sir Philip; and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) spoke, he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) turned to Miss Portman: <div class="bookquote">``Miss Portman has it! Damme, Miss Portman has him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div><p/>Belinda hastily withdrew her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) eyes from the picture at which she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) was looking. <div class="bookquote">``A most beautiful creature!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Lady Delacour.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``O faith! yes; I always do Clary the justice to say, he (<font color='blue'><b>Clary</b></font>) has a damned good taste for beauty.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But this seems to be foreign beauty,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>continued Lady Delacour, `if one may judge by her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) air, her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) dress, and the scenery about her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) -- cocoa-trees, plaintains: Miss Portman, what think you?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Belinda -LRB-but her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) voice faltered so much that she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) could hardly speak,-RRB- `that it is a scene from Paul and Virginia. I think the figure is St Pierre's Virginia.''

<p/>``Virginia St Pierre! ma``am,'' cried Mr Rochfort, winking at Sir Philip. <div class="bookquote">``No, no, damme! there you are wrong, Rochfort; say Hervey's Virginia, and then you have it, damme! or, may be, Virginia Hervey -- who knows?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``This is a portrait,''  (<font color='red'><b>the baronet</b></font>)</div>whispered the baronet to Lady Delacour, `of Clarence's mistress.'' Whilst her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) ladyship leant her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) ear to this whisper, which was sufficiently audible, she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) fixed a seemingly careless, but most observing, inquisitive eye upon poor Belinda. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) confusion, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) heard the whisper, was excessive.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>creature</b></font>) loves Clarence Hervey -- she (<font color='blue'><b>creature</b></font>) has no thoughts of Lord Delacour and his (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) coronet: I have done her (<font color='blue'><b>creature</b></font>) injustice,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>thought Lady Delacour, and instantly she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) despatched Sir Philip out of the room, for a catalogue of the pictures, begged Mr Rochort to get her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) something else, and, drawing Miss Portman's arm within hers, she (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) said, in a low voice, <div class="bookquote">``Lean upon me, my dearest Belinda: depend upon it, Clarence will never be such a fool as to marry the girl -- Virginia Hervey she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) will never be!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And what will become of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)? can Mr Hervey desert her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)? she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) looks like innocence itself -- and so young, too! Can he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) leave her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) for ever to sorrow, and vice, and infamy?''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>thought Belinda, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) eyes fixed, in silent anguish, upon the picture of Virginia. <div class="bookquote">``No, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) cannot do this: if he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) could he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) would be unworthy of me, and I ought to think of him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) no more. No; he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) will marry her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>); and I must think of him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) no more.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) turned abruptly away from the picture, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) saw Clarence Hervy standing beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you think of this picture? is it not beautiful? We are quite enchanted with it; but you do not seem to be struck with it, as we were at the first glance,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>said Lady Delacour.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Because,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div>answered Clarence, gaily, `it is not the first glance I have had at that picture -- I admired it yesterday, and admire it to-day.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But you are tired of admiring it, I see. Well, we shall not force you to be in raptures with it -- shall we, Miss Portman? A man may be tired of the most beautiful face in the world, or the most beautiful picture; but really there is so much sweetness, so much innocence, such tender melancholy in this countenance, that, if I were a man, I should inevitably be in love with it, and in love for ever! Such beauty, if it were in nature, would certainly fix the most inconstant man upon earth.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div><p/>Belinda ventured to take her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) eyes for an instant from the picture, to see whether Clarence Hervy looked like the most inconstant man upon earth. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hervy</b></font>) was intently gazing upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>); but as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) looked round, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervy</b></font>) suddenly exclaimed, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervy</b></font>) turned to the picture -- <div class="bookquote">``A heavenly countenance, indeed! -- the painter has done justice to the poet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Poet!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>repeated Lady Delacour: `the man's in the clouds!''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Pardon me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div>said Clarence; `does not M de St Pierre deserve to be called a poet? Though he (<font color='blue'><b>Pierre</b></font>) does not write in rhyme, surely he (<font color='blue'><b>Pierre</b></font>) has a poetical imagination.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Belinda; and from the composure with which Mr Hervey now spoke, she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) was suddenly inclined to believe, or to hope, that all Sir Philip's story was false. <div class="bookquote">``M de St Pierre undoubtedly has a great deal of imagination, and deserves to be called a poet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very likely, good people!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>said Lady Delacour; `but what has that to do with the present purpose?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div>cried Clarence, `your ladyship certainly sees that this is St Pierre's Virginia?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``St Pierre's Virginia! Oh, I know who it is, Clarence, as well as you do. I am not quite so blind, or so stupid, as you take me to be.''  (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Philip Baddely</b></font>)</div>Then recollecting her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) promise, not to betray Sir Philip's secret, she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) added, pointing to the landscape of the picture, <div class="bookquote">``These cocoa trees, this fountain, and the words Fontaine de Virginie, inscribed on the rock -- I must have been stupidity itself, if I had not found it out. I absolutely can read, Clarence, and spell, and put together. But here comes Sir Philip Baddely, who, I believe, cannot read, for I sent him (<font color='blue'><b>Baddely</b></font>) an hour ago for a catalogue, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Baddely</b></font>) pores over the book as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Baddely</b></font>) had not yet made out the title.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Sir Philip had purposely delayed, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) was afraid of rejoining Lady Delacour whilst Clarence Hervey was with her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>), and whilst they were talking of the picture of Virginia.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here's the catalogue; here's the picture your ladyship wants. St Pierre's Virginia: damme! I never heard of that fellow before -- he (<font color='blue'><b>Pierre</b></font>) is some new painter, damme! That is the reason I did not know the hand. Not a word of what I told you, Lady Delacour -- you won't blow us to Clary,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>added he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) aside to her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) ladyship. <div class="bookquote">``Rochfort keeps aloof; and so will I, damme!''

 (<font color='red'><b>A gentleman</b></font>)</div><p/>A gentleman at this instant beckoned to Mr Hervey with an air of great eagerness. Clarence went and spoke to him (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>), then returned with an altered countenance, and apologized to Lady Delacour for not dining with her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>), as he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) had promised. Business, he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) said, of great importance required that he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) should leave town immediately. Helena had just taken Miss Portman into a little room, where Westall's drawings were hung, to show her (<font color='blue'><b>Helena</b></font>) a group of Lady Anne Percival and her (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) children; and Belinda was alone with the little girl, when Mr Hervey came to bid her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) adieu. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) was in much agitation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Portman, I shall not, I am afraid, see you again for some time; -- perhaps I may never have that -- hem! -- happiness. I had something of importance that I wished to say to you before I left town; but I am forced to go so suddenly, I can hardly hope for any moment but the present to speak to you, madam. May I ask whether you purpose remaining much longer with Lady Delacour?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Belinda, much surprised. <div class="bookquote">``I believe -- I am not quite certain -- but I believe I shall stay with her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) ladyship some time longer.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr Hervey looked painfully embarrassed, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) eyes involuntarily fell upon little Helena. Helena drew her (<font color='blue'><b>Helena</b></font>) hand gently away from Belinda, left the room and retired to her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) mother.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That child, Miss Portman, is very fond of you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div>said Mr Hervey. Again he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) paused, and looked round to see whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) could be overheard. <div class="bookquote">``Pardon me for what I am going to say. This is not a proper place. I must be abrupt; for I am so circumstanced, that I have not a moment's time to spare. May I speak to you with the sincerity of a friend?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. Speak to me with sincerity,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Belinda, `and you will deserve that I should think you my friend.'' She (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) trembled excessively, but spoke and looked with all the firmness that she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) could command.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have heard a report,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div>said Mr Hervey, `which is most injurious to you.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``To me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Yes. No one can escape calumny. It is whispered, that if Lady Delacour should die -- '

<p/>At the word die, Belinda started.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That if Lady Delacour should die, Miss Portman would become the mother of Helena!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good Heavens! what an absurd report! Surely you could not for an instant believe it, Mr Hervey?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not for an instant. But I resolved, as soon as I heard it, to mention it to you; for I believe that half the miseries of the world arise from foolish mysteries -- from the want of courage to speak the truth. Now that you are upon your guard, your own prudence will defend you sufficiently. I never saw any of your sex who appeared to me to have so much prudence, and so little art; but -- farewell -- I have not a moment to lose,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div>added Clarence, suddenly checking himself; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) hurried away from Belinda, who stood fixed to the spot where he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) left her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>), till she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) was roused by the voices of several people who came into the room to see the drawings. She (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) started as if from a dream, and went immediately in search of Lady Delacour.

<p/>Sir Philip Baddely was in earnest conversation with her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) ladyship; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Baddely</b></font>) stopped speaking when Belinda came within hearing, and Lady Delacour turned to Helena, and said, <div class="bookquote">``My dear, if you are satisfied, for mercy's sake let us be gone, for I am absolutely overcome with heat -- and with curiosity,''  (<font color='red'><b>Helena/Miss Helena</b></font>)</div>added she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) in a low voice to Belinda: <div class="bookquote">``I long to hear how Clarence Hervey likes Westall's drawings.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div><p/>As soon as they got home, Lady Delacour sent her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) daughter to practise a new lesson upon the piano forte. <div class="bookquote">``And now sit down, my dear Belinda,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>), `and satisfy my curiosity. It is the curiosity of a friend, not of an impertinent busybody. Has Clarence declared himself? He (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) chose an odd time and place; but that is no matter. I forgive him (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>), and so do you, I dare say. But why do your tear that unfortunate carnation to pieces? Surely you cannot be embarrassed in speaking to me! What's the matter? I once did tell you, that I would not give up my claim to Clarence's adorations during my life; but I intend to live a few years longer after the amazonian operation is performed, you know; and I could not have the conscience to keep you waiting whole years. It is better to do things with a good grace, lest one should be forced at last to do them with an ill grace. Therefore I give up all manner of claim to every thing but -- flattery! that of course you will allow me from poor Clarence. So now do not begin upon another flower; but, without any farther superfluous modesty, let me hear all the pretty things Clarence said or swore.''

<p/>Whilst Belinda was pulling the carnation to pieces, she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) recollected what Mr Hervey had said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) about mysteries: his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) words still sounded in her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) ear. ``I believe that half the miseries of the world arise from foolish mysteries -- from the want of courage to speak the truth. ' I will have the courage to speak the truth, thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>), whatever it may cost me.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The only pretty thing that Mr Hervey said was, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) never saw any woman who had so much prudence and so little art,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Belinda.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A very pretty thing indeed, my dear! But it might have been said in open court by your grandfather, or your great-grandfather. I am sorry, if that was all, that Helena did not stay to hear such a charming moral compliment -- Moralité à la glace. The last thing I should have expected in a tête-à-tête with Clarence Hervey. Was it worth while to pull that poor flower to pieces for such a pretty speech as this? And so that was all?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``No, not all: but you overpower me with your wit; and I cannot stand the <div class="bookquote">``lightning of your eyes.'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There!''  (<font color='red'><b>ladyship</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) ladyship letting down her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) veil over her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) face, `the fire of my eyes is not too much for you now.''

<p/>``Helena was showing me Westall's drawing of Lady Anne Percival and her (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) children -- '

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And Mr Hervey wished that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) was the father of such a charming group of children, and you the mother -- hey? was not that it? It was not put in such plain terms, but that was the purport, I presume?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``No, not at all; he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) said nothing about Lady Anne Percival's children, but -- '

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But -- why then did you bring in her (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) ladyship and her (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) children? To gain time? -- Bad policy! -- Never, whilst you live, when you have a story to tell, bring in a parcel of people who have nothing to do with the beginning, the middle, or the end of it. How could I suspect you of such false taste! I really imagined these children were essential to the business; but I beg pardon for giving you these elements of criticism. I assure you I interrupt you, and talk on so fast, from pure good-nature, to give you time to recollect yourself; for I know you've the worst of memories, especially for what Clarence Hervey says. But come, my dear, dash into the middle of things at once, in the true Epic style.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then to dash into the midst of things at once,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Miss Portman, speaking very quick: <div class="bookquote">``Mr Hervey observed that Miss Delacour was growing very fond of me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Delacour, did you say?''  (<font color='red'><b>ladyship</b></font>)</div>cried her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) ladyship: ``Et puis? '

<p/>At this instant Champfort opened the door, looked in, and seeing Lady Delacour, immediately retired.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Champfort, whom do you want -- or what do you want?''  (<font color='red'><b>ladyship</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) ladyship.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Miladi, c'est que -- I did come from milord, to see if miladi and mademoiselle were visible. I did tink miladi was not at home.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You see I am at home, though,''  (<font color='red'><b>ladyship</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) ladyship. <div class="bookquote">``Has Lord Delacour any business with me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, miladi: not with miladi,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Champfort; `it was with mademoiselle.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``With me, Monsieur Champfort? then you will be so good as to tell Lord Delacour I am here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And that I am not here, Champfort; for I must be gone to dress.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) rose hastily to leave the room, but Miss Portman caught her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) hand: <div class="bookquote">``You won't go, I hope, Lady Delacour,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>), 'till I have finished my long story?'' Lady Delacour sat down again, ashamed of her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) own embarrassment.

<p/>Whether this be art, innocence, or assurance, thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>), I cannot tell; but we shall see.

<p/>Lord Delacour now came in, with a half-unfolded newspaper, and a packet of letters in his (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) hand. He (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) came to apologize to Miss Portman for having, by mistake, broken the seal of a letter to her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>), which had been sent under cover to him (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) had simply asked Champfort whether the ladies were at home, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) might not have the trouble of going up stairs if they were out. Monsieur Champfort possessed, in an eminent degree, the mischievous art of appearing mysterious about the simplest things in the world.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Though I was so thoughtless as to break the seal before I looked at the direction of the letter,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Delacour</b></font>)</div>said Lord Delacour, ``I assure you I went no farther than the first three words; for I knew ``my dear niece<div class="bookquote">'' could not possibly mean me.''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Delacour</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) gave Miss Portman the letter, and left the room. This explanation was perfectly satisfactory to Belinda; but Lady Delacour, prejudiced by the hesitation of Champfort, could not help suspecting that this letter was merely the ostensible cause of his (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) lordship's visit.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``From my aunt Stanhope,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Miss Portman, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) opened her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) letter. She (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) folded it up again after glancing over the first page, and put it into her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) pocket, colouring deeply.

<p/>All Lady Delacour's suspicions about Mrs Stanhope's epistolary counsels and secrets instantly recurred, with almost the force of conviction to her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) mind.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Portman,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``I hope your politeness to me does not prevent you from reading your letter? Some ceremonious people think it vastly rude to read a letter in company; but I am not one of them: I can write whilst you read, for I have fifty notes and more to answer. So pray read your letter at your ease.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Belinda had but just unfolded her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) letter again, when Lord Delacour returned, followed by Champfort, who brought with him (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) a splendid hammer-cloth.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here, my dear Lady Delacour,''  (<font color='red'><b>lordship surprise hammer-cloth</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) lordship, `is a little surprise for you: here is a new hammer-cloth, of my bespeaking and taste, which I hope you will approve of.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very handsome, upon my word!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>said Lady Delacour, coldly, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) fixed her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) eyes upon the fringe, which was black and orange: <div class="bookquote">``Miss Portman's taste, I see!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did you not say black and orange fringe, my dear!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No. I said blue and white, my lord.''

 (<font color='red'><b>lordship</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) lordship declared he (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) did not know how the mistake had happened; it was merely a mistake: -- but her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) ladyship was convinced that it was done on purpose. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) said to herself, <div class="bookquote">``Miss Portman will order my liveries next! I have not even the shadow of power left in my own house! I am not treated with even a decent show of respect! But this shall go on till I have full conviction of her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) views.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Dissembling her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) displeasure, she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) praised the hammer-cloth, and especially the fringe. Lord Delacour retired satisfied; and Miss Portman sat down to read the following letter from her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) aunt Stanhope.

<p/>CHAPTER XV

<p/>Jealousy

<p/>``Crescent, Bath, July -- Wednesday.

<p/>``MY DEAR NIECE,

<p/>``I RECEIVED safely the bank notes for my two hundred guineas, enclosed in your last. But you should never trust unnecessarily in this manner to the post -- always, when you are obliged to send bank notes by post, cut them in two, and send half by one post and half by another. This is what is done by all prudent people. Prudence, whether in trifles or in matters of consequence, can be learned only by experience -LRB-which is often too dearly bought-RRB-, or by listening, which costs nothing, to the suggestions of those who have a thorough knowledge of the world.

<p/>``A report has just reached me concerning you and a certain lord, which gives me the most heartfelt concern. I always knew, and told you, that you were a great favourite with the person in question. I depended on your prudence, delicacy, and principles, to understand this hint properly, and I trusted that you would conduct yourself accordingly. It is too plain, -LRB-from the report alluded to,-RRB- that there has been some misconduct or mismanagement somewhere. The misconduct I cannot -- the mismanagement I must, attribute to you, my dear; for let a man's admiration for any woman be ever so great, unless she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) suffer herself to be dazzled by vanity, or unless she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) be naturally of an inconsiderate temper, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) can surely prevent his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) partiality from becoming so glaring as to excite envy: envy is always to be dreaded by handsome young women, as being, sooner or later, infallibly followed by scandal. Of this, I fear, you have not been sufficiently aware and you see the consequences -- consequences which, to a female of genuine delicacy or of real good sense, must be extremely alarming. Men of contracted minds and cold tempers, who are absolutely incapable of feeling generous passion for our sex, are often unaccountably ambitious to gain the reputation of being well with any woman whose beauty, accomplishments, or connexions, may have brought her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) into fashion. Whatever affection may be pretended, this is frequently the ultimate and sole object of these selfish creatures. Whether or not the person I have in my eye deserve to be included in this class, I will not presume positively to determine; but you, who have personal opportunities of observation, may decide this point -LRB-if you have any curiosity on the subject-RRB- by observing whether he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) most affects to pay his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) devoirs to you in public or in private. If the latter be the case, it is the most dangerous; because a man even of the most contracted understanding has always sense or instinct enough to feel that the slightest taint in the reputation of the woman who is, or who is to be, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife, would affect his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own private peace, or his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) honour in the eyes of the world. A husband who has in a first marriage been, as it is said, in constant fear both of matrimonial subjugation and disgrace, would, in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) choice of a second lady, be peculiarly nice, and probably tardy. Any degree of favour that might have been shown him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), any report that may have been raised, and above all, any restraint he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) might feel himself under from implied engagement, or from the discovery or reputation of superior understanding and talents in the object beloved, would operate infallibly against her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), to the confusion of all her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) plans, and the ruin at once of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) reputation, her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) peace of mind, and her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) hopes of an establishment. Nay, supposing the best that could possibly happen -- that, after playing with the utmost dexterity this desperate game, the pool were absolutely your own; yet, if there were any suspicions of unfair play buzzed about amongst the by-standers, you would not in the main be a gainer; for my dear, without character, what is even wealth, or all that wealth can bestow? I do not mean to trouble you with stale wise sayings, which young people hate; nor musty morality, which is seldom fit for use in the world, or which smells too much of books to be brought into good company. This is not my way of giving advice; but I only beg you to observe what actually passes before your eyes in the circle in which we live. Ladies of the best families, with rank and fortune, and beauty and fashion, and every thing in their favour, cannot -LRB-as yet in this country-RRB- dispense with the strictest observance of the rules of virtue and decorum. Some have fancied themselves raised so high above the vulgar as to be in no danger from the thunder and lightning of public opinion; but these ladies in the clouds have found themselves mistaken -- they have been blasted, and have fallen nobody knows where! What is become of Lady --, and the Countess of --, and others I could mention, who were as high as envy could look? I remember seeing the Countess of --, who was then the most beautiful creature my eyes ever beheld, and the most admired that ever was heard of, come into the Opera-house, and sit the whole night in her (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) box without any woman's speaking or courtesying to her (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>), or taking any more notice of her (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) than you would of a post, or a beggar-woman. Even a coronet cannot protect a woman, you see, from disgrace: if she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) falls, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) and it, and all together, are trampled under foot. But why should I address all this to my dear niece? Whither have the terror and confusion I was thrown into by this strange report about you and Lord -- led me? And yet one cannot be too cautious -- ``Ce n'est que le premier mot qui coute'' -- Scandal never stops after the first word, unless she (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) be instantly gagged by a dexterous hand. Nothing shall be wanting on my part, but you alone are the person who can do any thing effectual. Do not imagine that I would have you quit Lady --, that is the first idea, I know, that will come into your silly little head, but put it out directly. If you were upon this attack to quit the field of battle, you yield the victory to your enemies. To leave Lady --'s house would be folly and madness. As long as she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) is your friend, or appears such, all is safe; but any coolness on her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) part would, in the present circumstances, be death to your reputation. And, even if you were to leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) on the best terms possible, the malicious world would say that you left her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) on the worst, and would assign as a reason the report alluded to. People who have not yet believed it would then conclude that it must be true; and thus by your cowardice you would furnish an incontrovertible argument against your innocence. I therefore desire that you will not, upon any account, think of coming home to me at present; indeed, I hope your own good sense would prevent you from wishing it, after the reasons that I have given. Far from quitting Lady -- from false delicacy, it is your business, from consideration for her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) peace, as well as your own, to redouble your attentions to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) in private, and, above all things, to appear as much as possible with her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) in public. I am glad to hear her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) health is so far re-established, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) can appear again in public; her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) spirits, as you may hint, will be the better for a little amusement. Luckily, you have it completely in your power to convince her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) and all the world of the correctness of your mind. I believe I certainly should have fainted, my dear, when I first heard this shocking report, if I had not just afterward received a letter from Sir Philip Baddely which revived me. His (<font color='blue'><b>Baddely</b></font>) proposal at this crisis for you, my dear, is a charming thing. You have nothing to do but to encourage his (<font color='blue'><b>Baddely</b></font>) addresses immediately, -- the report dies away of itself, and all is just as your best friends wish. Such an establishment for you, my dear, is indeed beyond their most sanguine expectations. Sir Philip hints in his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) letter, that my influence might be wanting with you in his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) favour; but this surely cannot be. As I have told him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) has merely mistaken becoming female reserve for a want of sensibility on your part, which would be equally unnatural and absurd. Do you know, my dear, that Sir Philip Baddely has an estate of fifteen thousand a-year in Wiltshire? and his (<font color='blue'><b>Baddely</b></font>) uncle Barton's estate in Norfolk will, in due time, pay his (<font color='blue'><b>Baddely</b></font>) debts. Then, as to family -- look in the lists of baronets in your pocket-book; and surely, my love, an old baronetage in actual possession is worth something more than the reversion of a new coronet; supposing that such a thing could properly be thought of, which Heaven forbid! So I see no possible objection to Sir Philip, my dear Belinda! and I am sure you have too much candour and good sense to make any childish or romantic difficulties. Sir Philip, is not, I know, a man of what you call genius. So much the better, my dear -- those men of genius are dangerous husbands; they have so many dislikes and eccentricities, there is no managing them, though they are mighty pleasant men in company to enliven conversation; for example, your favourite, Clarence Hervey. As it is well known he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) is not a marrying man, you never can have thought of him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>). You are not a girl to expose yourself to the ridicule, &c., of all your female acquaintance by romance and nonsense. I cannot conceive that a niece of mine could degrade herself by a mean prepossession for a man who has never made any declaration of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) attachment to her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>), and who, I am sure, feels no such attachment. That you may not deceive yourself, it is fit I should tell you, what otherwise it might not be so proper to mention to a young lady, that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) keeps and has kept a mistress for some years; and those who are most intimately in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) confidence have assured me that, if ever he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) marries any body, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) will marry this girl; which is not impossible, considering that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) is, they say, the most beautiful young creature that ever was seen, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) a man of genius. If you have any sense or spirit, I have said enough. So adieu! -- Let me hear, by return of the post, that every thing is going on as it should do. I am impatient to write to your sister Tollemache this good news. I always foretold that my Belinda would marry better than her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) sister, or any of her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) cousins, and take place of them all. Are not you obliged to me for sending you this winter to town to Lady --? It was an admirable hit. Pray tell Lady Delacour, with my best compliments, that our aloe friend -LRB-her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) ladyship will understand me-RRB- cheated a gentleman of my acquaintance the other day, at casino, out of seventy guineas. He (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) hates the sight of her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) odious red wig as much now as we always did. I knew, and told Lady D--, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) will do me the justice to remember, that Mrs -- cheated at play. What a contemptible character! -- Pray, my dear, do not forget to tell Lady Delacour, that I have a charming anecdote for her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>), about another friend of ours, who has lately gone over to the enemy. Has her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) ladyship seen a manuscript that is handed about as a great secret, and said to be by --, a parallel between our friend and the Chevalier d``Eon? It is done with infinite wit and humour, in the manner of Plutarch. I would send a copy, but am afraid my frank would be too heavy if I began upon another sheet. So once more adieu, my dear niece! Write to me without fail, and mention Sir Philip. I have written to him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) to give my approbation, &c.

<p/>``Yours sincerely,
<div class="bookquote">``SELINA STANHOPE.''


 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mrs Stanhope seems to have written you a volume instead of a letter, Miss Portman,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>cried Lady Delacour, as Belinda turned over the sheets of her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) aunt's long epistle. She (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) did not attempt to read it regularly through: some passages here and there were sufficient to astonish and shock her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) extremely. <div class="bookquote">``No bad news, I hope?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>said Lady Delacour, again looking up from her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) writing at Belinda, who sat motionless, leaning her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) head upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) hand, as if deep in thought, Mrs Stanhope's unfolded letter hanging from her (<font color='blue'><b>Stanhope</b></font>) hand. In the midst of the variety of embarrassing, painful, and alarming feelings excited by this letter, she (<font color='blue'><b>Stanhope</b></font>) had sufficient strength of mind to adhere to her (<font color='blue'><b>Stanhope</b></font>) resolution of speaking the exact truth to Lady Delacour. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) was roused by her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) ladyship's question, <div class="bookquote">``No bad news, I hope, Miss Portman?''  (<font color='red'><b>ladyship</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) instantly answered, with all the firmness she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) could command. <div class="bookquote">``Yes. My aunt has been alarmed by a strange report which I heard myself for the first time this morning from Mr Hervey. I am sure I am much obliged to him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) for having the courage to speak the truth to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Here she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) repeated what Mr Hervey had said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>).

<p/>Lady Delacour never raised her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) eyes whilst Belinda spoke, but went on scratching out some words in what she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) was writing. Through the mask of paint which she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) wore no change of colour could be visible; and as Belinda did not see the expression of her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) ladyship's eyes, she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) could not in the least judge of what was passing in her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) mind.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr Hervey has acted like a man of honour and sense,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>said Lady Delacour; ``But it is a pity, for your sake, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) did not speak sooner -- before this report became so public -- before it reached Bath, and your aunt. Though it could not surprise her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) much, she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) has such a perfect knowledge of the world, and -- '

<p/>Lady Delacour uttered these broken sentences in a voice of suppressed anger; cleared her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) throat several times, and at last, unable to speak, stopped short, and then began with much precipitation to put wafers into several notes that she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) had been writing. So it has reached Bath, thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) -- the report is public! I never till now heard a hint of any such thing except from Sir Philip Baddely; but it has doubtless been the common talk of the town, and I am laughed at as a dupe and an idiot, as I am. And now, when the thing can be concealed no longer, she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) comes to me with that face of simplicity, and knowing my generous temper, throws herself on my mercy, and trusts that her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) speaking to me with this audacious plainness will convince me of her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) innocence. <div class="bookquote">``You have acted in the most prudent manner possible, Miss Portman,''  (<font color='red'><b>ladyship</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) ladyship, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) went on sealing her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) notes, `by speaking at once to me of this strange, scandalous, absurd report. Do you act from your aunt Stanhope's advice, or entirely from your own judgment and knowledge of my character?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``From my own judgment and knowledge of your character, in which I hope -- I am not -- I cannot be mistake,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Belinda, looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) with a mixture of doubt and astonishment.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No -- you calculated admirably -- 'twas the best, the only thing you could do. Only,''  (<font color='red'><b>ladyship</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) ladyship, falling back in her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) chair with an hysteric laugh, `only the blunder of Champfort, and the entrance of my Lord Delacour, and the hammer-cloth with the orange and black fringe -- forgive me, my dear; for the soul of me I can't help laughing -- it was rather unlucky; so awkward, such a contretemps! But you,<div class="bookquote">'' added she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>), wiping her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) eyes, as if recovering from laughter, `you have such admirable presence of mind, nothing disconcerts you! You are equal to all situations, and stand in no need of such long letters of advice from your aunt Stanhope,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>pointing to the two folio sheets which lay at Belinda's feet.

<p/>The rapid, unconnected manner in which Lady Delacour spoke, the hurry of her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) motions, the quick, suspicious, angry glances of her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) eye, her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) laugh, her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) unintelligible words, all conspired at this moment to give Belinda the idea that her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) intellects were suddenly disordered. She (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) was so firmly persuaded of her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) ladyship's utter indifference to Lord Delacour, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) never conceived the possibility of her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) being actuated by the passion of jealousy -- by the jealousy of power -- a species of jealousy which she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) had never felt, and could not comprehend. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) had sometimes seen Lady Delacour in starts of passion that seemed to border on insanity, and the idea of her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) losing all command of her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) reason now struck Belinda with irresistible force. She (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) felt the necessity of preserving her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) own composure; and with all the calmness that she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) could assume, she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) took up her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) aunt Stanhope's letter, and looked for the passage in which Mrs Luttridge and Harriot Freke were mentioned. If I can turn the course of Lady Delacour's mind, thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>), or catch her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) attention, perhaps she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) will recover herself. <div class="bookquote">``Here is a message to you, my dear lady Delacour,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>cried she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>), `from my aunt Stanhope, about -- about Mrs Luttridge.''

<p/>Miss Portman's hand trembled as she (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) turned over the pages of the letter. <div class="bookquote">``I am all attention,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>said Lady Delacour, with a composed voice; `only take care, don't make a mistake: I'm in no hurry; don't read anything Mrs Stanhope might not wish. It is dangerous to garble letters, almost as dangerous as to snatch them out of a friend's hands, as I once did, you know -- but you need not now be under the least alarm.''

<p/>Conscious that this letter was not fit for her (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>) ladyship to see, Belinda neither offered to show it to her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>), nor attempted any apology for her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) reserve and embarrassment, but hastily began to read the message relative to Mrs Luttridge; her (<font color='blue'><b>Luttridge</b></font>) voice gaining confidence as she (<font color='blue'><b>Luttridge</b></font>) went on, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Luttridge</b></font>) observed that she (<font color='blue'><b>Luttridge</b></font>) had fixed Lady Delacour's attention, who now sat listening to her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>), calm and motionless. But when Miss Portman came to the words, <div class="bookquote">``Do not forget to tell Lady D--, that I have a charming anecdote for her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) about another friend of hers, who lately went over to the enemy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) ladyship exclaimed with great vehemence, ``Friend! -- Harriot Freke! -- Yes, like all other friends -- Harriot Freke! -- What was she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) compared to? <div class="bookquote">``Tis too much for me -- too much!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>and she (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) put her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) hand to her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) head.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Compose yourself, my dear friend,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Belinda, in a calm, gentle tone; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) went toward her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) with an intention of soothing her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) by caresses; but, at her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) approach, Lady Delacour pushed the table on which she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) had been writing from her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) with violence, started up, flung back the veil which fell over her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) face as she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) rose, and darted upon Belinda a look, which fixed her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) to the spot where she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) stood. It said, <div class="bookquote">``Come not a step nearer, at your peril!''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>Belinda's blood ran cold -- she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) had no longer any doubt that this was insanity. She (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) shut the penknife which lay upon the table, and put it into her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) pocket.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Cowardly creature!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>cried Lady Delacour, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) countenance changed to the expression of ineffable contempt; `what is it you fear?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That you should injure yourself. Sir down -- for Heaven's sake listen to me, to your friend, to Belinda!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My friend! my Belinda!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>cried Lady Delacour, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) turned from her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>), and walked away some steps in silence; then suddenly clasping her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) hands, she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) raised her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) eyes to heaven with a fervent but wild expression of devotion, and exclaimed, <div class="bookquote">``Great God of heaven, my punishment is just! the death of Lawless is avenged. May the present agony of my soul expiate my folly! Of guilt -- deliberate guilt -- of hypocrisy -- treachery -- I have not -- oh, never may I have -- to repent!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) paused -- her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) eyes involuntarily returned upon Belinda. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, Belinda! You, whom I have so loved -- so trusted!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The tears rolled fast down her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) painted cheeks; she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) wiped them hastily away, and so roughly, that her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) face became a strange and ghastly spectacle. Unconscious of her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) disordered appearance, she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) rushed past Belinda, who vainly attempted to stop her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>), threw up the sash, and stretching herself far out of the window, gasped for breath. Miss Portman drew her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) back, and closed the window, saying, ``The rouge is all off your face, my dear Lady Delacour; you are not fit to be seen. Sit down upon this sofa, and I will ring for Marriott, and get some fresh rouge. Look at your face in this glass -- you see -- '

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I see,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>interrupted Lady Delacour, looking full at Belinda, `that she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) who I thought had the noblest of souls has the meanest! I see that she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) is incapable of feeling. Rouge! not fit to be seen! -- At such a time as this, to talk to me in this manner! Oh, niece of Mrs Stanhope! -- dupe! dupe that I am!'' She (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>) flung herself upon the sofa, and struck her (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>) forehead with her (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>) hand violently several times. Belinda catching her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) arm, and holding it with all her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) force, cried in a tone of authority, <div class="bookquote">``Command yourself, Lady Delacour, I conjure you, or you will go out of your senses; and if you do, your secret will be discovered by the whole world.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hold me not -- you have no right,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>cried Lady Delacour, struggling to free her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) hand. <div class="bookquote">``All-powerful as you are in this house, you have no longer any power over me! I am not going out of my senses! You cannot get me into Bedlam, all-powerful, all-artful as you are. You have done enough to drive me mad -- but I am not mad. No wonder you cannot believe me -- no wonder you are astonished at the strong expression of feelings that are foreign to your nature -- no wonder that you mistake the writhings of the heart, the agony of a generous soul, for madness! Look not so terrified; I will do you no injury. Do not you hear that I can lower my voice? -- do not you see that I can be calm? Could Mrs Stanhope herself -- could you, Miss Portman, speak in a softer, milder, more polite, more proper tone than I do now? Are you pleased, are you satisfied?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am better satisfied -- a little better satisfied,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Belinda.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's well; but still you tremble. There's not the least occasion for apprehension -- you see I can command myself, and smile upon you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, do not smile in that horrid manner!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why not? -- Horrid! -- Don't you love deceit?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I detest it from my soul.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>said Lady Delacour, still speaking in the same low, soft, unnatural voice: `then why do you practise it, my love?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I never practised it for a moment -- I am incapable of deceit. When you are really calm, when you can really command yourself, you will do me justice, Lady Delacour; but now it is my business, if I can, to bear with you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are goodness itself, and gentleness, and prudence personified. You know perfectly how to manage a friend, whom you fear you have driven just to the verge of madness. But tell me, good, gentle, prudent Miss Portman, why need you dread so much that I should go mad? You know, if I went mad, nobody would mind, nobody would believe whatever I say -- I should be no evidence against you, and I should be out of your way sufficiently, shouldn't I? And you would have all the power in your own hands, would not you? And would not this be almost as well as if I were dead and buried? No; your calculations are better than mine. The poor mad wife would still be in your way, would yet stand between you and the fond object of your secret soul -- a coronet!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>As she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) pronounced the word coronet, she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) pointed to a coronet set in diamonds on her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) watch-case which lay on the table. Then suddenly seizing the watch, she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) dashed it upon the marble hearth with all her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) force -- <div class="bookquote">``Vile bauble!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>cried she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>); `must I lose my only friend for such a thing as you? Oh, Belinda! do you see that a coronet cannot confer happiness?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have seen it long: I pity you from the bottom of my soul,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Belinda, bursting into tears.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Pity me not. I cannot endure your pity, treacherous woman!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>cried Lady Delacour, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) stamped with a look of rage -- `most perfidious of women!''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, call me perfidious, treacherous -- stamp at me -- say, do what you will; I can and will bear it all -- all patiently; for I am innocent, and you are mistaken and unhappy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Belinda. <div class="bookquote">``You will love me when you return to your senses; then how can I be angry with you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Fondle me not,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>said Lady Delacour, starting back from Belinda's caresses: `do not degrade yourself to no purpose -- I never more can be your dupe. Your protestations of innocence are wasted on me -- I am not so blind as you imagine -- dupe as you think me, I have seen much in silence. The whole world, you find, suspects you now. To save your reputation, you want my friendship -- you want -- '

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I want nothing from you, Lady Delacour,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Belinda. <div class="bookquote">``You have suspected me long in silence! Then I have mistaken your character -- I can love you no longer. Farewell for ever! Find another -- a better friend.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) walked away from Lady Delacour with proud indignation; but, before she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) reached the door, she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) recollected her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) promise to remain with this unfortunate woman.

<p/>Is a dying woman, in the paroxysm of insane passion, a fit object of indignation? thought Belinda, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) stopped short. <div class="bookquote">``No, Lady Delacour,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>cried she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``I will not yield to my honour -- I will not listen to my pride. A few words said in the heat of passion shall not make me forget myself or you. You have given me your confidence; I am grateful for it. I cannot, will not desert you: my promise is sacred.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Your promise!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>said Lady Delacour, contemptuously. ``I absolve you from your promise. Unless you find it convenient to yourself to remember it, pray let it be forgotten; and if I must die --'

<p/>At this instant the door opened suddenly, and little Helena came in singing --

<p/>'<div class="bookquote">``Merrily, merrily shall we live now,
Under the blossom that hangs on the bough.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Helena/Miss Helena</b></font>)</div>What comes next, Miss Portman?''
Lady Delacour dragged her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) veil across her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) face, and rushed out of the room.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is the matter? -- Is mamma ill?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Belinda. But at this instant she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) heard the sound of Lord Delacour's voice upon the stairs; she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) broke from the little girl, and with the greatest precipitation retreated to her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) own room.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) had not been alone above an hour before Marriott knocked at the door.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Portman, you don't know how late it is. Lady Singleton and the Miss Singletons are come. But, merciful heaven!''  (<font color='red'><b>Marriott/Mrs Marriott</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Marriott, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) entered the room, `what is all this packing up? What is this trunk?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am going to Oakly-park with Lady Anne Percival,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Belinda, calmly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought there was something wrong; my mind misgave me all the time I was dressing my lady, -- she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was in such a flutter, and never spoke to me. I'd lay my life this is, some way or other, Mr Champfort's doings. But, good dear Miss Portman, can you leave my poor lady when she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) wants you so much; and I'll take upon me to say, ma'am, loves you so much at the bottom of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) heart? Dear me, how your face is flushed! Pray let me pack up these things, if it must be. But I do hope, if it be possible, that you should stay. However, I've no business to speak. I beg pardon for being so impertinent: I hope you won't take it ill, -- it is only from regard to my poor lady I ventured to speak.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Your regard to your lady deserves the highest approbation, Marriott,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Belinda. <div class="bookquote">``It is impossible that I should stay with her (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) any longer. When I am gone, good Marriott, and when her (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) health and strength decline, your fidelity and your services will be absolutely necessary to your mistress; and from what I have seen of the goodness of your heart, I am convinced that the more she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) is in want of you, the more respectful will be your attention.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Marriott/Mrs Marriott</b></font>)</div><p/>Marriott answered only by her (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) tears, and went on packing up in a great hurry.

<p/>Nothing could equal Lady Delacour's astonishment when she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) learnt from Marriott that Miss Portman was actually preparing to leave the house. After a moment's reflection, however, she (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) persuaded herself that this was only a new artifice to work upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) affections; that Belinda did not mean to leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>); but that she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) would venture all lengths, in hopes of being at the last moment pressed to stay. Under this persuasion, Lady Delacour resolved to disappoint her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) expectations: she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) determined to meet her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) with that polite coldness which would best become her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) own dignity, and which, without infringing the laws of hospitality, would effectually point out to the world that Lady Delacour was no dupe, and that Miss Portman was an unwelcome inmate in her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) house.

<p/>The power of assuming gaiety when her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) heart was a prey to the most poignant feelings, she (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) had completely acquired by long practice. With the promptitude of an actress, she (<font color='blue'><b>actress</b></font>) could instantly appear upon the stage, and support a character totally foreign to her (<font color='blue'><b>actress</b></font>) own. The loud knocks at the door, which announced the arrival of company, were signals that operated punctually upon her (<font color='blue'><b>actress</b></font>) associations; and to this species of conventional necessity her (<font color='blue'><b>actress</b></font>) most violent passions submitted with magical celerity. Fresh rouged, and beautifully dressed, she (<font color='blue'><b>actress</b></font>) was performing her (<font color='blue'><b>actress</b></font>) part to a brilliant audience in her (<font color='blue'><b>actress</b></font>) drawing-room when Belinda entered. Belinda beheld her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) with much astonishment, but more pity.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Portman,''  (<font color='red'><b>ladyship</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) ladyship, turning carelessly towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>), `where do you buy your rouge? -- Lady Singleton, would you rather at this moment be mistress of the philosopher's stone, or have a patent for rouge that will come and go like Miss Portman's? -- Apropos! have you read St Leon?'' Her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) ladyship was running on to a fresh train of ideas, when a footman announced the arrival of Lady Anne Percival's carriage; and Miss Portman rose to depart.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You dine with Lady Anne, Miss Portman, I understand? -- My compliments to her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) ladyship, and my duty to Mrs Margaret Delacour, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) macaw. Au revoir! Though you talk of running away from me to Oakly-park, I am sure you will do no such cruel thing. I am, with all due humility, so confident of the irresistible attractions of this house, that I defy Oakly-park and all its charms. So, Miss Portman, instead of adieu, I shall only say, au revoir!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Adieu, Lady Delacour!''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Belinda, with a look and tone which struck her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) ladyship to the heart. All her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) suspicions, all her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) pride, all her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) affected gaiety vanished; her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) presence of mind forsook her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>), and for some moments she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) stood motionless and powerless. Then recollecting herself, she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) flew after Miss Portman, abruptly stopped her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) at the head of the stairs, and exclaimed, <div class="bookquote">``My dearest Belinda, are you gone? -- My best, my only friend! -- Say you are not gone for ever! -- Say you will return!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Adieu!''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>repeated Belinda. It was all she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) could say; she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) broke from Lady Delacour, and hurried out of the house with the strongest feeling of compassion for this unhappy woman, but with an unaltered sense of the propriety and necessity of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) own firmness.

<p/>CHAPTER XVI

<p/>Domestic Happiness

<p/>THERE was an air of benevolence and perfect sincerity in the politeness with which Lady Anne Percival received Belinda that was peculiarly agreeable to her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) agitated and harassed mind.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You see, Lady Anne,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Belinda, `that I come to you at last, after having so often refused your kind invitations.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So you surrender yourself at discretion, just when I was going to raise the siege in despair,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Anne/Lady Anne Percival/Percival</b></font>)</div>said Lady Anne: `now I may make my own terms; and the only terms I shall impose are, that you will stay at Oakly-park with us, as long as we can make it agreeable to you, and no longer. Whether those you cease to please, or those who cease to be pleased, are most to blame 6, it may sometimes be difficult to determine; so difficult, that when this becomes a question between two friends, they perhaps had better part than venture upon the discussion.''

<p/>Lady Anne Percival could not avoid suspecting that something disagreeable had passed between Lady Delacour and Belinda; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) was not troubled with the disease of idle curiosity, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) example prevailed upon Mrs Margaret Delacour, who dined with her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>), to refrain from all questions and comments.

<p/>The prejudice which this lady had conceived against our heroine, as being a niece of Mrs Stanhope's, had lately been vanquished by the favourable representations of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>) conduct which she (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>) had heard from her (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>) nephew, and by the kindness that Belinda had shown to little Helena.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Madam,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Delacour/Mrs Margaret Delacour/Margaret</b></font>)</div>said Mrs Delacour, addressing herself to Miss Portman with some formality, but much dignity, `permit me, as one of my Lord Delacour's nearest relations now living, to return you my thanks for having, as my nephew informs me, exerted your influence over Lady Delacour for the happiness of his (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) family. My little Helena, I am sure, feels her (<font color='blue'><b>Helena</b></font>) obligations towards you, and I rejoice that I have had an opportunity of expressing, in person, my sense of what our family owes to Miss Portman. As to the rest, her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) own heart will reward her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>). The praise of the world is but an inferior consideration. However, it deserves to be mentioned, as an instance of the world's candour, and for the singularity of the case, that every body agrees in speaking well even of so handsome a young lady as Miss Portman.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) must have had extraordinary prudence,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Anne/Lady Anne Percival/Percival</b></font>)</div>said Lady Anne; `and the world does justly to reward it with extraordinary esteem.''

<p/>Belinda, with equal pleasure and surprise, observed that all this was said sincerely, and that the report, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) had feared was public, had never reached Mrs Delacour or Lady Anne Percival.

<p/>In fact, it was known and believed only by those who had been prejudiced by the malice or folly of Sir Philip Baddely. Piqued by the manner in which his (<font color='blue'><b>Baddely</b></font>) addresses had been received by Belinda, he (<font color='blue'><b>Baddely</b></font>) readily listened to the comfortable words of his (<font color='blue'><b>Baddely</b></font>) valet de chambre, who assured him (<font color='blue'><b>Baddely</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Baddely</b></font>) had it from the best possible authority -LRB-Lord Delacour's own gentleman, Mr Champfort-RRB-, that his (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) lordship was deeply taken with Miss Portman -- that the young lady managed every thing in the house -- that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had been very prudent, to be sure, and had refused large presents -- but that there was no doubt of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) becoming Lady Delacour, if ever his (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) lordship should be at liberty. Sir Philip was the person who mentioned this to Clarence Hervey, and Sir Philip was the person who hinted it to Mrs Stanhope, in the very letter which he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) wrote to implore her (<font color='blue'><b>Stanhope</b></font>) influence in favour of his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) own proposal. This manoeuvring lady represented this report as being universally known and believed, in hopes of frightening her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) niece into an immediate match with the baronet. In the whole extent of Mrs Stanhope's politic imagination, she (<font color='blue'><b>Stanhope</b></font>) had never foreseen the possibility of her (<font color='blue'><b>Stanhope</b></font>) niece's speaking the simple truth to Lady Delacour, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) had never guarded against this danger. She (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) never thought of Belinda's mentioning this report to her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) ladyship, because she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) would never have dealt so openly, had she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) been in the place of her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) niece. Thus her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) art and falsehood operated against her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) own views, and produced consequences diametrically opposite to her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) expectations. It was her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) exaggerations that made Lady Delacour believe, when Belinda repeated what she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) had said, that this report was universally known and credited; her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) own suspicions were by these means again awakened, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) jealousy and rage were raised to such a pitch, that, no longer mistress of herself, she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) insulted her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) friend and guest. Miss Portman was then obliged to do the very thing that Mrs Stanhope most dreaded -- to leave Lady Delacour's house and all its advantages. As to Sir Philip Baddely, Belinda never thought of him (<font color='blue'><b>Baddely</b></font>) from the moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) read her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) aunt's letter, till after she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) had left her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) ladyship; her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) mind was firmly decided upon this subject; yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) could not help fearing that her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) aunt would not understand her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) reasons, or approve her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) conduct. She (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) wrote to Mrs Stanhope in the most kind and respectful manner; assured her (<font color='blue'><b>Stanhope</b></font>) that there had been no foundation whatever for the report which had produced so much uneasiness; that Lord Delacour had always treated her (<font color='blue'><b>Stanhope</b></font>) with politeness and good-nature, but that such thoughts or views as had been attributed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Stanhope</b></font>) was convinced had never entered his (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) lordship's mind; that hearing of the publicity of this report had, however, much affected Lady D--. <div class="bookquote">``I have, therefore,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Belinda, `thought it prudent to quit her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) ladyship, and to accept of an invitation from Lady Anne Percival to Oakly-park. I hope, my dear aunt, that you will not be displeased by my leaving town without seeing Sir Philip Baddely again. Our meeting could indeed answer no purpose, as it is entirely out of my power to return his (<font color='blue'><b>Baddely</b></font>) partiality. Of his (<font color='blue'><b>Baddely</b></font>) character, temper, and manners, I know enough to be convinced, that our union could tend only to make us both miserable. After what I have seen, nothing can ever tempt me to marry from any of the common views of interest or ambition.''

<p/>On this subject Belinda, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) declared her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) own sentiments with firm sincerity, touched as slightly as she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) could, because she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) anxiously wished to avoid all appearance of braving the opinions of an aunt to whom she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) was under obligations. She (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) was tempted to pass over in silence all that part of Mrs Stanhope's letter which related to Clarence Hervey; but upon reflection, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>) determined to conquer her (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>) repugnance to speak of him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>), and to make perfect sincerity the steady rule of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>) conduct. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>) therefore acknowledged to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>) aunt, that of all the persons she (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>) had hitherto seen, this gentleman was the most agreeable to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>); but at the same time she (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>) assured her (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>), that the refusal of Sir Philip Baddely was totally independent of all thoughts of Mr Hervey -- that, before she (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>) had received her (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>) aunt's letter, circumstances had convinced her (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>) that Mr Hervey was attached to another woman. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>) concluded by saying, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>) had neither romantic hopes nor wishes, and that her (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>) affections were at her (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>) own command.

<p/>Belinda received the following angry answer from Mrs Stanhope:--

<p/>``Henceforward, Belinda, you may manage your own affairs as you think proper; I shall never more interfere with my advice. Refuse whom you please -- go where you please -- get what friends, and what admirers, and what establishment you can -- I have nothing more to do with it -- I will never more undertake the management of young people. There's your sister Tollemache has made a pretty return for all my kindness! she (<font color='blue'><b>Tollemache</b></font>) is going to be parted from her (<font color='blue'><b>Tollemache</b></font>) husband, and basely throws all the blame upon me. But `tis the same with all of you. There's your cousin Joddrell refused me a hundred guineas last week, though the piano-forte and harp I bought for her (<font color='blue'><b>Tollemache</b></font>) before she (<font color='blue'><b>Tollemache</b></font>) was married stood me in double that sum, and are now useless lumber on my hands; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Tollemache</b></font>) never could have had Joddrell without them, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Tollemache</b></font>) knows as well as I do. As for Mrs Levit, she (<font color='blue'><b>Levit</b></font>) never writes to me, and takes no manner of notice of me. But this is no matter, for her (<font color='blue'><b>Levit</b></font>) notice can be of no consequence now to any body. Levit has run out every thing he (<font color='blue'><b>Tollemache</b></font>) had in the world! -- All his (<font color='blue'><b>Tollemache</b></font>) fine estates advertised in to-day's paper -- an execution in the house, I'm told. I expect that she (<font color='blue'><b>Levit</b></font>) will have the assurance to come to me in her (<font color='blue'><b>Levit</b></font>) distress: but she (<font color='blue'><b>Levit</b></font>) shall find my doors shut, I promise her (<font color='blue'><b>Levit</b></font>). Your cousin Valleton's match has, through her (<font color='blue'><b>Levit</b></font>) own folly, turned out like all the rest. She (<font color='blue'><b>Levit</b></font>), her (<font color='blue'><b>Levit</b></font>) husband, and all his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) relations are at daggers-drawing; and Valleton will die soon, and won't leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Levit</b></font>) a farthing in his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) will, I foresee, and all the fine Valleton estate goes to God knows whom!

<p/>``If she (<font color='blue'><b>Levit</b></font>) had taken my advice after marriage as before, it would have been all her (<font color='blue'><b>Levit</b></font>) own at this instant. But the passions run away with people, and they forget every thing -- common sense, gratitude, and all -- as you do, Belinda. Clarence Hervey will never think of you, and I give you up! -- Now manage for yourself as you please, and as you can! I'll have nothing more to do with the affairs of young ladies who will take no advice.

<p/>``SELINA STANHOPE.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``P.S.. If you return directly to Lady Delacour's, and marry Sir Philip Baddely, I will forgive the past.''


 (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div><p/>The regret which Belinda felt at having grievously offended her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) aunt was somewhat alleviated by the reflection that she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) had acted with integrity and prudence. Thrown off her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) guard by anger, Mrs Stanhope had inadvertently furnished her (<font color='blue'><b>Stanhope</b></font>) niece with the best possible reasons against following her (<font color='blue'><b>Stanhope</b></font>) advice with regard to Sir Philip Baddely, by stating that her (<font color='blue'><b>Stanhope</b></font>) sister and cousins, who had married with mercenary views, had made themselves miserable, and had shown their aunt neither gratitude nor respect.

<p/>The tranquillity of Belinda's mind was gradually restored by the society that she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) enjoyed at Oakly-park. She (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) found herself in the midst of a large and cheerful family, with whose domestic happiness she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) could not forbear to sympathize. There was an affectionate confidence, an unconstrained gaiety in this house, which forcibly struck her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>), from its contrast with what she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) had seen at Lady Delacour's. She (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) perceived that between Mr Percival and Lady Anne there was a union of interests, occupations, taste, and affection. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was at first astonished by the openness with which they talked of their affairs in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) presence; that there were no family secrets, nor any of those petty mysteries which arise from a discordance of temper or struggle for power. In conversation, every person expressed without constraint their wishes and opinions; and wherever these differed, reason and the general good were the standards to which they appealed. The elder and younger part of the family were not separated from each other; even the youngest child in the house seemed to form part of the society, to have some share and interest in the general occupations or amusements. The children were treated neither as slaves nor as playthings, but as reasonable creatures; and the ease with which they were managed, and with which they managed themselves, surprised Belinda; for she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) heard none of that continual lecturing which goes forward in some houses, to the great fatigue and misery of all the parties concerned, and of all the spectators. Without force or any factitious excitements, the taste for knowledge, and the habits of application, were induced by example, and confirmed by sympathy. Mr Percival was a man of science and literature, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) daily pursuits and general conversation were in the happiest manner instructive and interesting to his (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) family. His (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) knowledge of the world, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) natural gaiety of disposition, rendered his (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) conversations not only useful, but in the highest degree amusing. From the merest trifles he (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) could lead to some scientific fact, some happy literary allusion, or philosophical investigation.

<p/>Lady Anne Percival had, without any pedantry or ostentation, much accurate knowledge, and a taste for literature, which made her (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) the chosen companion of her (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) husband's understanding, as well as of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) heart. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was not obliged to reserve his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) conversation for friends of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) own sex, nor was he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) forced to seclude himself in the pursuit of any branch of knowledge; the partner of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) warmest affections was also the partner of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) most serious occupations; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) sympathy and approbation, and the daily sense of her (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) success in the education of their children, inspired him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) with a degree of happy social energy, unknown to the selfish solitary votaries of avarice and ambition.

<p/>In this large and happy family there was a variety of pursuits. One of the boys was fond of chemistry, another of gardening; one of the daughters had a talent for painting, another for music; and all their acquirements and accomplishments contributed to increase their mutual happiness, for there was no envy or jealousy amongst them.

<p/>Those who unfortunately have never enjoyed domestic happiness, such as we have just described, will perhaps suppose the picture to be visionary and romantic; there are others -- it is hoped many others -- who will feel that it is drawn from truth and real life. Tastes that have been vitiated by the stimulus of dissipation might, perhaps, think these simple pleasures insipid.

<p/>Every body must ultimately judge of what makes them happy, from the comparison of their own feelings in different situations. Belinda was convinced by this comparison, that domestic life was that which could alone make her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) really and permanently happy. She (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) missed none of the pleasures, none of the gay company, to which she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) had been accustomed at Lady Delacour's. She (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) was conscious, at the end of each day, that it had been agreeably spent; yet there were no extraordinary exertions made to entertain her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>); every thing seemed in its natural course, and so did her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) mind. Where there was so much happiness, no want of what is called pleasure was ever experienced. She (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) had not been at Oakly-park a week before she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) forgot that it was within a few miles of Harrowgate, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) never once recollected her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) vicinity to this fashionable water-drinking place for a month afterward.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Impossible!''  (<font color='red'><b>some ladies</b></font>)</div>some young ladies will exclaim. We hope others will feel that it was perfectly natural. But to deal fairly with our readers, we must not omit to mention a certain Mr Vincent, who came to Oakly-park during the first week of Belinda's visit, and who stayed there during the whole succeeding month of felicity. Mr Vincent was a creole; he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) was about two-and-twenty: his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) person and manners were striking and engaging; he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) was tall, and remarkably handsome; he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) had large dark eyes, an aquiline nose, fine hair, and a manly sunburnt complexion; his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) countenance was open and friendly, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) spoke upon any interesting subject, it lighted up, and became full of fire and animation. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) used much gesture in conversation; he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) had not the common manners of young men who are, or who aim at being thought, fashionable, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) was perfectly at ease in company, and all that was uncommon about him (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) appeared foreign. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) had a frank, ardent temper, incapable of art or dissimulation, and so unsuspicious of all mankind, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) could scarcely believe falsehood existed in the world, even after he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) had himself been its dupe. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) was in extreme astonishment at the detection of any species of baseness in a gentleman; for he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) considered honour and generosity as belonging indefeasibly, if not exclusively, to the privileged orders. His (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) notions of virtue were certainly aristocratic in the extreme, but his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) ambition was to entertain such only as would best support and dignify an aristocracy. His (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) pride was magnanimous, not insolent; and his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) social prejudices were such as, in some degree, to supply the place of the power and habit of reasoning, in which he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was totally deficient. One principle of philosophy he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) practically possessed in perfection; he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) enjoyed the present, undisturbed by any unavailing regret for the past, or troublesome solicitude about the future. All the goods of life he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) tasted with epicurean zest; all the evils he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) bore with stoical indifference. The mere pleasure of existence seemed to keep him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) in perpetual good humour with himself and others; and his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) never-failing flow of animal spirits exhilarated even the most phlegmatic. To persons of a cold and reserved temper he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) sometimes appeared rather too much of an egotist: for he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) talked with fluent enthusiasm of the excellent qualities and beauties of whatever he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) loved, whether it were his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) dog, his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) horse, or his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) country: but this was not the egotism of vanity; it was the overflowing of an affectionate heart, confident of obtaining sympathy from his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) fellow-creatures, because conscious of feeling it for all that existed.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was as grateful as he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was generous; and though high-spirited and impatient of restraint, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) would submit with affectionate gentleness to the voice of a friend, or listen with deference to the counsel of those in whose superior judgment he (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>) had confidence. Gratitude, respect, and affection, all conspired to give Mr Percival the strongest power over his (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) soul. Mr Percival had been a guardian and a father to him (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>). His (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) own father, an opulent merchant, on his (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) death-bed requested that his (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) son, who was then about eighteen, might be immediately sent to England for the advantages of a European education. Mr Percival, who had a regard for the father, arising from circumstances which it is not here necessary to explain, accepted the charge of young Vincent, and managed so well, that his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) ward when he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) arrived at the age of twenty-one did not feel relieved from any restraint. On the contrary, his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) attachment to his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) guardian increased from that period, when the laws gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) full command over his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) fortune and his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) actions. Mr Vincent had been at Harrowgate for some time before Mr Percival came into the country; but as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) heard of Mr Percival's arrival, he (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) left half finished a game of billiards, of which, by-the-bye, he (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) was extremely fond, to pay his (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) respects at Oakly-park. At the first sight of Belinda, he (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) did not seem much struck with her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) appearance; perhaps, from his (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) thinking that there was too little languor in her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) eyes, and too much colour in her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) cheeks; he (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) confessed that she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) was graceful, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) motions were not quite slow enough to please him (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>).

<p/>It is somewhat singular that Lady Delacour's faithful friend, Harriot Freke, should be the cause of Mr Vincent's first fixing his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) favourable attention on Miss Portman.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) had a black servant of the name of Juba, who was extremely attached to him (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>): he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) had known Juba from a boy, and had brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) over with him (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) first came to England, because the poor fellow begged so earnestly to go with young massa. Juba had lived with him (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) ever since, and accompanied him (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) wherever he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) went. Whilst he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) was at Harrowgate, Mr Vincent lodged in the same house with Mrs Freke. Some dispute arose between their servants, about the right to a coach-house, which each party claimed as exclusively their own. The master of the house was appealed to by Juba, who sturdily maintained his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) massa's right; he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) established it, and rolled his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) massa's curricle into the coach-house in triumph. Mrs Freke, who heard and saw the whole transaction from her (<font color='blue'><b>Freke</b></font>) window, said, or swore, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Freke</b></font>) would make Juba repent of what she (<font color='blue'><b>Freke</b></font>) called his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) insolence. The threat was loud enough to reach his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) ears, and he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) looked up in astonishment to hear such a voice from a woman; but an instant afterwards he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) began to sing very gaily, as he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) jumped into the curricle to turn the cushions, and then danced himself up and down by the springs, as if rejoicing in his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) victory. A second and a third time Mrs Freke repeated her (<font color='blue'><b>Freke</b></font>) threat, confirming it by an oath, and then violently shut down the window and disappeared. Mr Vincent, to whom Juba, with much simplicity, expressed his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) aversion of the man-woman who lived in the house with him (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>), laughed at the odd manner in which the black imitated her (<font color='blue'><b>Freke</b></font>) voice and gesture, but thought no more of the matter. Some time afterward, however, Juba's spirits forsook him (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) was never heard to sing or to whistle, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) scarcely ever spoke even to his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) master, who was much surprised by this sudden change from gaiety and loquacity to melancholy taciturnity. Nothing could draw from the poor fellow any explanation of the cause of this alteration in his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) humour; and though he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) seemed excessively grateful for the concern which his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) master showed about his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) health, no kindness or amusement could restore him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) wonted cheerfulness. Mr Vincent knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) was passionately fond of music; and having heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) once express a wish for a tambourine, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) one: but Juba never played upon it, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) spirits seemed every day to grow worse and worse. This melancholy lasted during the whole time that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) remained at Harrowgate, but from the first day of his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) arrival at Oakly-park he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) began to mend: after he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) had been there a week, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) was heard to sing, and whistle, and talk as he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) used to do, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) master congratulated him (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) recovery. One evening his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) master asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) to go back to Harrowgate for his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) tambourine, as little Charles Percival wished to hear him (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) play upon it. This simple request had a wonderful effect upon poor Juba; he (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) began to tremble from head to foot, his (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) eyes became fixed, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) stood motionless; after some time, he (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) suddenly clasped his (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) hands, fell upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) knees, and exclaimed:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, massa, Juba die! If Juba go back, Juba die!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) wiped away the drops that stood upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) forehead. <div class="bookquote">``But me will go, if massa bid -- me will die!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr Vincent/Vincent</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr Vincent began to imagine that the poor fellow was out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) senses. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) assured him (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>), with the greatest kindness, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) would almost as soon hazard his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) own life as that of such a faithful, affectionate servant; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) pressed him (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) to explain what possible danger he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) dreaded from returning to Harrowgate. Juba was silent, as if afraid to speak. -- <div class="bookquote">``Don't fear to speak to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr Vincent/Vincent</b></font>)</div>said Mr Vincent; <div class="bookquote">``I will defend you: if anybody have injured you, or if you dread that any body will injure you, trust to me; I will protect you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr Vincent/Vincent</b></font>)</div><p/>``Ah, massa, you no can! Me die, if me go back! Me no can say word more;' and he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) put his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) finger upon his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) lips, and shook his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) head. Mr Vincent knew that Juba was excessively superstitious; and convinced, that, if his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) mind were not already deranged, it would certainly become so, were any secret terror thus to prey upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) imagination, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) assumed a very grave countenance, and assured him (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>), that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) should be extremely displeased if he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) persisted in his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) foolish and obstinate silence. Overcome by this, Juba burst into tears, and answered:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Den me will tell all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div><p/>This conversation passed before Miss Portman and Charles Percival, who were walking in the park with Mr Vincent, at the time he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) met Juba and asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) to go for the tambourine. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) came to the words, <div class="bookquote">``Me will tell all,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) made a sign that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) wished to tell it to his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) master alone. Belinda and the little boy walked on, to leave him (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) at liberty to speak; and then, though with a sort of reluctant horror, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) told that the figure of an old woman, all in flames, had appeared to him (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) bed-chamber at Harrowgate every night, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) was sure she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was one of the obeah-women of his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) own country, who had pursued him (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) to Europe to revenge his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) having once, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) was a child, trampled upon an egg-shell that contained some of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) poisons. The extreme absurdity of this story made Mr Vincent burst out a laughing; but his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) humanity the next instant made him (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) serious; for the poor victim of superstitious terror, after having revealed what, according to the belief of his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) country, it is death to mention, fell senseless on the ground. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) came to himself, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) calmly said, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) must now die, for that the obeah-women never forgave those that talked of them or their secrets; and, with a deep groan, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) added, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) wished he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) might die before night, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) might not see her (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) again. It was in vain to attempt to reason him (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) out of the idea that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) had actually seen this apparition: his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) account of it was, that it first appeared to him (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) in the coach-house one night, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) went thither in the dark -- that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) never afterwards went to the coach-house in the dark -- but that the same figure of an old woman, all in flames, appeared at the foot of his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) bed every night whilst he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) stayed at Harrowgate; and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) was then persuaded she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would never let him (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) escape from her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) power till she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had killed him (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>). That since he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) had left Harrowgate, however, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had not tormented him (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>), for he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) had never seen her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) was in hopes that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had forgiven him (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>); but that now he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) was sure of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) vengeance for having spoken of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).

<p/>Mr Vincent knew the astonishing power which the belief in this species of sorcery 7 has over the minds of the Jamaica negroes; they pine and actually die away from the moment they fancy themselves under the malignant influence of these witches. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) almost gave poor Juba over for lost. The first person that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) happened to meet after his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) conversation was Belinda, to whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) eagerly related it, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) had observed, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) had listened with much attention and sympathy to the beginning of the poor fellow's story. The moment that she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) heard of the flaming apparition, she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) recollected having seen a head drawn in phosphorus, which one of the children had exhibited for her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) amusement, and it occurred to her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) that, perhaps, some imprudent or ill-natured person might have terrified the ignorant negro by similar means. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) mentioned this to Mr Vincent, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) recollected the threat that had been thrown out by Mrs Freke, the day that Juba had taken possession of the disputed coach-house; and from the character of this lady, Belinda judged that she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) would be likely to play such a trick, and to call it, as usual, fun or frolic. Miss Portman suggested that one of the children should show him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) the phosphorus, and should draw some ludicrous figure with it in his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) presence. This was done, and it had the effect that she (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) expected. Juba, familiarized by degrees with the object of his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) secret horror, and convinced that no obeah-woman was exercising over him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) sorceries, recovered his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) health and spirits. His (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) gratitude to Miss Portman, who was the immediate cause of his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) cure, was as simple and touching as it was lively and sincere. This was the circumstance which first turned Mr Vincent's attention towards Belinda. Upon examining the room in which the negro used to sleep at Harrowgate, the strong smell of phosphorus was perceived, and part of the paper was burnt on the very spot where he (<font color='blue'><b>negro</b></font>) had always seen the figure, so that he (<font color='blue'><b>negro</b></font>) was now perfectly convinced that this trick had been purposely played to frighten him (<font color='blue'><b>negro</b></font>), in revenge for his (<font color='blue'><b>negro</b></font>) having kept possession of the coach-house.

<p/>Mrs Freke, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Freke</b></font>) found herself detected, gloried in the jest, and told the story as a good joke wherever she (<font color='blue'><b>Freke</b></font>) went -- triumphing in the notion, that it was she (<font color='blue'><b>Freke</b></font>) who had driven both master and man from Harrowgate.

<p/>The exploit was, however, by no means agreeable in its consequences to her (<font color='blue'><b>Freke</b></font>) friend Mrs Luttridge, who was now at Harrowgate. For reasons of her (<font color='blue'><b>Freke</b></font>) own, she (<font color='blue'><b>Freke</b></font>) was very anxious to fix Mr Vincent in her (<font color='blue'><b>Freke</b></font>) society, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Freke</b></font>) was much provoked by Mrs Freke's conduct. The ladies came to high words upon the occasion, and an irreparable breech would have ensued had not Mrs Freke, in the midst of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>) rage, recollected Mrs Luttridge's electioneering interest: and suddenly changing her (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>) tone, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>) declared that `she (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>) was really sorry to have driven Mr Vincent from Harrowgate; that her (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>) only intention was to get rid of his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) black; she (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>) would lay any wager, that, with Mrs Luttridge's assistance, they could soon get the gentleman back again;' and she (<font color='blue'><b>Luttridge</b></font>) proposed, as a certain method of fixing Mr Vincent in Mrs Luttridge's society, to invite Belinda to Harrowgate.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You may be sure,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Freke</b></font>)</div>said Mrs Freke, `that she (<font color='blue'><b>Freke</b></font>) must by this time be cursedly tired of her (<font color='blue'><b>Freke</b></font>) visit to those stupid good people at Oakly-park, and never woman wanted an excuse to do any thing she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) liked: so trust to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) own ingenuity to make some decent apology to the Percivals for running away from them. As to Vincent, you may be sure Belinda Portman is his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) only inducement for staying with that precious family-party; and if we have her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) we have him (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>). Now we can be sure of her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>), for she (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) has just quarrelled with our dear Lady Delacour. I had the whole story from my maid, who had it from Champfort. Lady Delacour and she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) are at daggers-drawing, and it will be delicious to her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) to hear her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) ladyship handsomely abused. We are the declared enemies of her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) enemy, so we must be her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) friends. Nothing unites folk so quickly and so solidly, as hatred of some common foe.''

<p/>This argument could not fail to convince Mrs Luttridge, and the next day Mrs Freke commenced her (<font color='blue'><b>Freke</b></font>) operations. She (<font color='blue'><b>Freke</b></font>) drove in her (<font color='blue'><b>Freke</b></font>) unicorn to Oakly-park to pay Miss Portman a visit. She (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) had no acquaintance either with Mr Percival or Lady Anne, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had always treated Belinda, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) met her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) in town, rather cavalierly, as an humble companion of Lady Delacour. But it cost Mrs Freke nothing to change her (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>) tone: she (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>) was one of those ladies who can remember or forget people, be perfectly familiar or strangely rude, just as it suits the convenience, fashion, or humour of the minute.

<p/>CHAPTER XVII

<p/>Rights of Woman

<p/>BELINDA was alone, and reading, when Mrs Freke dashed into the room.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How do, dear creature?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>cried she (<font color='blue'><b>Freke</b></font>), stepping up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Freke</b></font>), and shaking hands with her (<font color='blue'><b>Freke</b></font>) boisterously -- <div class="bookquote">``How do? -- Glad to see you, faith! -- Been long here? -- Tremendously hot to-day!''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Freke</b></font>) flung herself upon the sofa beside Belinda, threw her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) hat upon the table, and then continued speaking.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And how d'ye go on here, poor child? -- Gad! I'm glad you're alone -- expected to find you encompassed by a whole host of the righteous. Give me credit for my courage in coming to deliver you out of their hands. Luttridge and I had such compassion upon you, when we heard you were close prisoner here! I swore to set the distressed damsel free, in spite of all the dragons in Christendom; so let me carry you off in triumph in my unicorn, and leave these good people to stare when they come home from their sober walk, and find you gone. There's nothing I like so much as to make good people stare -- I hope you're of my way o' thinking -- you don't look as if you were, though; but I never mind young ladies' looks -- always give the lie to their thoughts. Now we talk o'looks -- never saw you look so well in my life -- as handsome as an angel! And so much the better for me. Do you know, I've a bet of twenty guineas on your head -- on your face, I mean. There's a young bride at Harrowgate, Lady H--, they're all mad about her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>); the men swear she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>)'s the handsomest woman in England, and I swear I know one ten times as handsome. They've dared me to make good my word, and I've pledged myself to produce my beauty at the next ball, and to pit her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) against their belle for any money. Most votes carry it. I'm willing to double my bet since I've seen you again. Come, had not we best be off? Now don't refuse me and make speeches -- you know that's all nonsense -- I'll take all the blame upon myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div><p/>Belinda, who had not been suffered to utter a word whilst Mrs Freke ran on in this strange manner, looked in unfeigned astonishment; but when she (<font color='blue'><b>Freke</b></font>) found herself seized and dragged towards the door, she (<font color='blue'><b>Freke</b></font>) drew back with a degree of gentle firmness that astonished Mrs Freke. With a smiling countenance, but a steady tone, she (<font color='blue'><b>Freke</b></font>) said, `that she (<font color='blue'><b>Freke</b></font>) was sorry Mrs Freke's knight-errantry should not be exerted in a better cause, for that she (<font color='blue'><b>Freke</b></font>) was neither a prisoner, nor a distressed damsel.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And will you make me lose my bet?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs</b></font>)</div>cried Mrs Freke. ``Oh, at all events, you must come to the ball! -- I'm down for it. But I'll not press it now, because you're frightened out of your poor little wits, I see, at the bare thoughts of doing any thing considered out of rule by these good people. Well, well! it shall be managed for you -- leave that to me: I'm used to managing for cowards. Pray tell me -- you and Lady Delacour are off, I understand? -- Give ye joy! -- She (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) and I were once great friends; that is to say, I had over her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) ``that power which strong minds have over weak ones,<div class="bookquote">'' but she (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>) was too weak for me -- one of those people that have neither courage to be good, nor to be bad.''

 (<font color='red'><b>ones</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The courage to be bad,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Belinda, <div class="bookquote">``I believe, indeed, she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) does not possess.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs Freke stared. <div class="bookquote">``Why, I heard you had quarrelled with her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If I had,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Belinda, <div class="bookquote">``I hope that I should still do justice to her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) merits. It is said that people are apt to suffer more by their friends than their enemies. I hope that will never be the case with Lady Delacour, as I confess that I have been one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) friends.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">''`Gad, I like your spirit -- you don't want courage, I see, to fight even for your enemies. You are just the kind of girl I admire. I see you have been prejudiced against me by Lady Delacour; but whatever stories she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) may have trumped up, the truth of the matter is this, there's no living with her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>)'s so jealous -- so ridiculously jealous -- of that lord of hers, for whom all the time she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) has the impudence to pretend not to care more than I do for the sole of my boot,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Freke</b></font>)</div>said Mrs Freke, striking it with her (<font color='blue'><b>Freke</b></font>) whip; `but she (<font color='blue'><b>Freke</b></font>) hasn't the courage to give him (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) tit for tat: now this is what I call weakness. Pray, how do she (<font color='blue'><b>Freke</b></font>) and Clarence Hervey go on together? -- Are they out o' the hornbook of platonics yet?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr Hervey was not in town when I left it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Belinda.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Was not he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>)? -- Ho! ho! -- He (<font color='blue'><b>Ho</b></font>)'s off then! -- Ay, so I prophesied; she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>)'s not the thing for him (<font color='blue'><b>Ho</b></font>): he (<font color='blue'><b>Ho</b></font>) has some strength of mind -- some soul -- above vulgar prejudices; so must a woman be to hold him (<font color='blue'><b>Ho</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Ho</b></font>) was caught at first by her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) grace and beauty, and that sort of stuff; but I knew it could not last -- knew she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'d dilly dally with Clary, till he (<font color='blue'><b>Clary</b></font>) would turn upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Clary</b></font>) heel and leave her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I fancy that you are entirely mistaken both with respect to Mr Hervey and Lady Delacour,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>Belinda very seriously began to say. But Mrs Freke interrupted her (<font color='blue'><b>Freke</b></font>), and ran on; <div class="bookquote">``No! no! no! I'm not mistaken; Clarence has found her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) out. She (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>)'s a very woman -- that he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) could forgive her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>), and so could I; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>)'s a mere woman -- and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) can't forgive -- no more can I.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>There was a kind of drollery about Mrs Freke, which, with some people, made the odd things she (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>) said pass for wit. Humour she (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>) really possessed; and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>) chose it, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>) could be diverting to those who like buffoonery in women. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>) had set her (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>) heart upon winning Belinda over to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>) party. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>) began by flattery of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>) beauty; but as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>) saw that this had no effect, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>) next tried what could be done by insinuating that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>) had a high opinion of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>) understanding, by talking to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>) as an esprit fort.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``For my part,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``I own I should like a strong devil better than a weak angel.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You forget,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Belinda, `that it is not Milton, but Satan, who says,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Fallen spirit, to be weak is to be miserable.'' (<font color='red'><b>Satan spirit</b></font>)</div>'
<div class="bookquote">``You read, I see! -- I did not know you were a reading girl. So was I once; but I never read now. Books only spoil the originality of genius: very well for those who can't think for themselves -- but when one has made up one's opinion, there is no use in reading.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But to make them up,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>replied Belinda, `may it not be useful?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of no use upon earth to minds of a certain class. You, who can think for yourself, should never read.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I read that I may think for myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Only ruin your understanding, trust me. Books are full of trash -- nonsense, conversation is worth all the books in the world.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And is there never any nonsense in conversation?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What have you here?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Freke</b></font>)</div>continued Mrs Freke, who did not choose to attend to this question; exclaiming, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Freke</b></font>) reviewed each of the books on the table in their turns, in the summary language of presumptuous ignorance, <div class="bookquote">``Smith's Theory of Moral Sentiments -- milk and water! Moore's Travels -- hasty pudding! La Bruyère -- nettle porridge! This is what you were at when I came in, was it not?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Freke</b></font>), taking up a book 8 in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Freke</b></font>) saw Belinda's mark: <div class="bookquote">``Against Inconsistency in our Expectations. Poor thing! who bored you with this task?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr Percival recommended it to me, as one of the best essays in the English language.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The devil! they seem to have put you in a course of the bitters -- a course of the woods might do your business better. Do you ever hunt? -- Let me take you out with me some morning -- you'd be quite an angel on horseback; or let me drive you out some day in my unicorn.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div><p/>Belinda declined this invitation, and Mrs Freke strode away to the window to conceal her (<font color='blue'><b>Freke</b></font>) mortification, threw up the sash, and called out to her (<font color='blue'><b>Freke</b></font>) groom, <div class="bookquote">``Walk those horses about, blockhead!''

 (<font color='red'><b>groom</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr Percival and Mr Vincent at this instant came into the room.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hail, fellow! well met!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Freke</b></font>)</div>cried Mrs Freke, stretching out her (<font color='blue'><b>Freke</b></font>) hand to Mr Vincent.

<p/>It has been remarked, that an antipathy subsists between creatures, who, without being the same, have yet a strong external resemblance. Mr Percival saw this instinct rising in Mr Vincent, and smiled.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hail fellow! well met! I say. Shake hands and be friends, man! Though I'm not in the habit of making apologies, if it will be any satisfaction to you, I beg your pardon for frightening your poor devil of a black.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr Percival</b></font>)</div><p/>Then turning towards Mr Percival, she (<font color='blue'><b>Freke</b></font>) measured him (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) with her (<font color='blue'><b>Freke</b></font>) eye, as a person whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Freke</b></font>) longed to attack. She (<font color='blue'><b>Freke</b></font>) thought, that if Belinda's opinion of the understanding of these Percivals could be lowered, she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) should rise in her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) esteem: accordingly, she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) determined to draw Mr Percival into an argument.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've been talking treason, I believe, to Miss Portman,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>cried she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>); `for I've been opposing some of your opinions, Mr Percival.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you opposed them all, madam,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr Percival</b></font>)</div>said Mr Percival, <div class="bookquote">``I should not think it treason.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr Percival</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Vastly polite! -- But I think all our politeness hypocrisy: what d'ye say to that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You know that best, madam!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then I'll go a step farther; for I'm determined you shall contradict me: I think all virtue is hypocrisy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I need not contradict you, madam,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr Percival</b></font>)</div>said Mr Percival, `for the terms which you make use of contradict themselves.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is my system,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Freke</b></font>)</div>pursued Mrs Freke, `that shame is always the cause of the vices of women.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is sometimes the effect,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr Percival</b></font>)</div>said Mr Percival; `and, as cause and effect are reciprocal, perhaps you may, in some instances, be right.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! I hate qualifying arguers -- plump assertion or plump denial for me: you sha'n't get off so. I say shame is the cause of all women's vices.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``False shame, I suppose you mean?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr Percival</b></font>)</div>said Mr Percival.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mere play upon words! All shame is false shame -- we should be a great deal better without it. What say you, Miss Portman? -- Silent, hey? Silence that speaks.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Portman's blushes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr Vincent/Vincent</b></font>)</div>said Mr Vincent, `speak for her (<font color='blue'><b>Freke</b></font>).''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Against her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs</b></font>)</div>said Mrs Freke: `women blush because they understand.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And you would have them understand without blushing?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr Percival</b></font>)</div>said Mr Percival. ``I grant you that nothing can be more different than innocence and ignorance. Female delicacy --'

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This is just the way you men spoil women,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Freke</b></font>)</div>cried Mrs Freke, `by talking to them of the delicacy of their sex, and such stuff. This delicacy enslaves the pretty delicate dears.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No; it enslaves us,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr Vincent/Vincent</b></font>)</div>said Mr Vincent.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hate slavery! Vive la liberté!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs</b></font>)</div>cried Mrs Freke. <div class="bookquote">``I'm a champion for the Rights of Woman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am an advocate for their happiness,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr Percival</b></font>)</div>said Mr Percival, `and for their delicacy, as I think it conduces to their happiness.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm an enemy to their delicacy, as I am sure it conduces to their misery.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You speak from experience?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr Percival</b></font>)</div>said Mr Percival.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, from observation. Your most delicate women are always the greatest hypocrites; and, in my opinion, no hypocrite can or ought to be happy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you have not proved the hypocrisy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Belinda. ``Delicacy is not, I hope, an indisputable proof of it? If you mean false delicacy --'

<p/><div class="bookquote">``To cut the matter short at once,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Freke</b></font>)</div>cried Mrs Freke, `why, when a woman likes a man, does not she (<font color='blue'><b>Freke</b></font>) go and tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) so honestly?''

<p/>Belinda, surprised by this question from a woman, was too much abashed instantly to answer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Because she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)'s a hypocrite. That is and must be the answer.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr Percival</b></font>)</div>said Mr Percival; `because, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) be a woman of sense, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) knows that by such a step she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would disgust the object of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) affection.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Cunning! -- cunning! -- cunning! -- the arms of the weakest.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Prudence! prudence! -- the arms of the strongest. Taking the best means to secure our own happiness without injuring that of others is the best proof of sense and strength of mind, whether in man or woman. Fortunately for society, the same conduct in ladies which best secures their happiness most increases ours.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Freke</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs Freke beat the devil's tattoo for some moments, and then exclaimed, <div class="bookquote">``You may say what you will, but the present system of society is radically wrong: -- whatever is, is wrong.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the devil</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How would you improve the state of society?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr Percival</b></font>)</div>asked Mr Percival, calmly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm not tinker-general to the world,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Freke</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm glad of it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr Percival</b></font>)</div>said Mr Percival; `for I have heard that tinkers often spoil more than they mend.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But if you want to know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Freke</b></font>)</div>said Mrs Freke, `what I would do to improve the world, I'll tell you: I'd have both sexes call things by their right names.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This would doubtless by a great improvement,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr Percival</b></font>)</div>said Mr Percival; `but you would not overturn society to attain it, would you? Should we find things much improved by tearing away what has been called the decent drapery of life?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Drapery, if you ask me my opinion,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Freke</b></font>)</div>cried Mrs Freke, `drapery, whether wet or dry, is the most confoundedly indecent thing in the world.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That depends on public opinion, I allow,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr Percival</b></font>)</div>said Mr Percival. <div class="bookquote">``The Lacedæmonian ladies, who were veiled only by public opinion, were better covered from profane eyes than some English ladies are in wet drapery.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know nothing of the Lacedæmonian ladies: I took my leave of them when I was a schoolboy -- girl, I should say. But pray, what o'clock is it by you? I've sat till I'm cramped all over,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>cried Mrs. Freke, getting up and stretching herself so violently that some part of her (<font color='blue'><b>Freke</b></font>) habiliments gave way. <div class="bookquote">``Honi soit qui mal y pense!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Freke</b></font>), bursting into a horse laugh.

<p/>Without sharing in any degree that confusion which Belinda felt for her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) strode out of the room, saying, <div class="bookquote">``Miss Portman, you understand these things better than I do; come and set me to rights.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) was in Belinda's room, she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) threw herself into an armchair, and laughed immoderately.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How I have trimmed Percival this morning!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am glad you think so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Belinda; `for I really was afraid he (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) had been too severe upon you.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I only wish,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Freke</b></font>)</div>continued Mrs Freke, <div class="bookquote">``I only wish his (<font color='blue'><b>schoolboy</b></font>) wife had been by. Why the devil did not she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) make her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) appearance? I suppose the prude was afraid of my demolishing and unrigging her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Freke</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There seems to have been more danger of that for you than for any body else,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Belinda, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) assisted to set Mrs Freke's rigging, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Freke</b></font>) called it, to rights.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I do of all things delight in hauling good people's opinions out of their musty drawers, and seeing how they look when they're all pulled to pieces before their faces! Pray, are those Lady Anne's drawers or yours?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Freke</b></font>)</div>said Mrs Freke, pointing to a chest of drawers.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm sorry for it; for if they were hers, to punish her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) for shirking me, by the Lord, I'd have every rag she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) has in the world out in the middle of the floor in ten minutes! You don't know me -- I'm a terrible person when provoked -- stop at nothing!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Freke</b></font>)</div><p/>As Mrs Freke saw no other chance left of gaining her (<font color='blue'><b>Freke</b></font>) point with Belinda, she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) tried what intimidating her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) would do.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I stop at nothing,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>repeated she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>), fixing her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) eyes upon Miss Portman, to fascinate her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) by terror. <div class="bookquote">``Friend or foe! peace or war! Take your choice. Come to the ball at Harrowgate, I win my bet, and I'm your sworn friend. Stay away, I lose my bet, and am your sworn enemy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is not in my power, madam,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Belinda, calmly, `to comply with your request.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then you'll take the consequences,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs</b></font>)</div>cried Mrs Freke. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>) rushed past her (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>), hurried down stairs, and called out, <div class="bookquote">``Bid my blockhead bring my unicorn.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>), her (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>) unicorn, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>) blockhead, were out of sight in a few minutes.

<p/>Good may be drawn from evil. Mrs Freke's conversation, though at the time it confounded Belinda, roused her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>), upon reflection, to examine by her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) reason the habits and principles which guided her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) conduct. She (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) had a general feeling that they were right and necessary; but now, with the assistance of Lady Anne and Mr Percival, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) established in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) own understanding the exact boundaries between right and wrong upon many subjects. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) felt a species of satisfaction and security, from seeing the demonstration of those axioms of morality, in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had previously acquiesced. Reasoning gradually became as agreeable to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) as wit; nor was her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) taste for wit diminished, it was only refined by this process. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) now compared and judged of the value of the different species of this brilliant talent.

<p/>Mrs Freke's wit, thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Freke</b></font>), is like a noisy squib, the momentary terror of passengers; Lady Delacour's like an elegant firework, which we crowd to see, and cannot forbear to applaud; but Lady Anne Percival's wit is like the refulgent moon, we

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Love the mild rays, and bless the useful light.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Anne/Lady Anne Percival/Percival</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Miss Portman,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr Percival</b></font>)</div>said Mr Percival, `are not you afraid of making an enemy of Mrs Freke, by declining her (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>) invitation to Harrowgate?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) friendship more to be dreaded than her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) enmity,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>replied Belinda.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then you are not to be terrified by an obeah-woman?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr Vincent/Vincent</b></font>)</div>said Mr Vincent.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not in the least, unless she (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) were to come in the shape of a false friend,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Belinda.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Till lately,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr Vincent/Vincent</b></font>)</div>said Mr Vincent, <div class="bookquote">``I was deceived in the character of Mrs Freke. I thought her (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>) a dashing, free-spoken, free-hearted sort of eccentric person, who would make a staunch friend and a jolly companion. As a mistress, or a wife, no man of any taste could think of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>). Compare that woman now with one of our creole ladies.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr Vincent/Vincent</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But why with a creole?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr Percival</b></font>)</div>said Mr Percival.

<p/>``For the sake of contrast, in the first place: our creole women are all softness, grace, delicacy -- '

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And indolence,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr Percival</b></font>)</div>said Mr Percival.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Their indolence is but a slight, and, in my judgment, an amiable defect; it keeps them out of mischief, and it attaches them to domestic life. The activity of a Mrs Freke would never excite their emulation; and so much the better.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So much the better, no doubt,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr Percival</b></font>)</div>said Mr Percival. <div class="bookquote">``But is there no other species of activity that might excite their ambition with propriety? Without diminishing their grace, softness, or delicacy, might not they cultivate their minds? Do you think ignorance, as well as indolence, an amiable defect, essential to the female character?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not essential. You do not, I hope, imagine that I am so much prejudiced in favour of my countrywomen, that I can neither see nor feel the superiority in some instances of European cultivation? I speak only in general.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And in general,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Anne/Lady Anne Percival/Percival</b></font>)</div>said Lady Anne Percival, `does Mr Vincent wish to confine our sex to the bliss of ignorance?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If it be bliss,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr Vincent/Vincent</b></font>)</div>said Mr Vincent, `what reason would they have for complaint?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Belinda; `but that is a question which you have not yet decided.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And how can we decide it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr Vincent/Vincent</b></font>)</div>said Mr Vincent. <div class="bookquote">``The taste and feelings of individuals must be the arbiters of their happiness.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You leave reason quite out of the question, then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr Percival</b></font>)</div>said Mr Percival, `and refer the whole to taste and feeling? So that if the most ignorant person in the world assert that he (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) is happier than you are, you are bound to believe him (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>).''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why should not I?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr Vincent/Vincent</b></font>)</div>said Mr Vincent.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Because,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr Percival</b></font>)</div>said Mr Percival, `though he (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) can judge of his (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) own pleasures, he (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) cannot judge of yours; his (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) are common to both, but yours are unknown to him (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>). Would you, at this instant, change places with that ploughman yonder, who is whistling as he (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) goes for want of thought? or, would you choose to go a step higher in the bliss of ignorance, and turn savage?''

<p/>Mr Vincent laughed, and protested that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) should be very unwilling to give up his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) title to civilized society; and that, instead of wishing to have less knowledge, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) regretted that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) had not more. <div class="bookquote">``I am sensible,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>), `that I have many prejudices; -- Miss Portman has made me ashamed of some of them.''

<p/>There was a degree of candour in Mr Vincent's manner and conversation, which interested every body in his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) favour; Belinda amongst the rest. She (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) was perfectly at ease in Mr Vincent's company, because she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) considered him (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) as a person who wished for her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) friendship, without having any design to engage her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) affections. From several hints that dropped from him (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>), from Mr Percival, and from Lady Anne, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was persuaded that he (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) was attached to some creole lady; and all that he (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) said in favour of the elegant softness and delicacy of his (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) countrywomen confirmed this opinion.

<p/>Miss Portman was not one of those young ladies who fancy that every gentleman who converses freely with them will inevitably fall a victim to the power of their charms, and who see in every man a lover, or nothing.

<p/>CHAPTER XVIII

<p/>A Declaration

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'VE found it! -- I've found it, mamma!''  (<font color='red'><b>Charles/Charles Percival</b></font>)</div>cried little Charles Percival, running eagerly into the room with a plant in his (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) hand. <div class="bookquote">``Will you send this in your letter to Helena Delacour, and tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) that is the thing that gold fishes are so fond of? And tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) that it is called lemna, and that it may be found in any ditch or pool.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But how can she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) find ditches and pools in Grosvenor-square, my dear?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I forgot that. Then will you tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>), mamma, that I will send her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) a great quantity?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How, my dear?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know, mamma, yet -- but I will find out some way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Would it not be as well, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) mother, smiling, `to consider how you can perform your promises before you make them?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A gentleman,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr Vincent/Vincent</b></font>)</div>said Mr Vincent, `never makes a promise that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) cannot perform.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I know that very well,''  (<font color='red'><b>the boy Portman</b></font>)</div>said the boy, proudly: <div class="bookquote">``Miss Portman, who is very good-natured, will, I am sure, be so good, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) goes back to Lady Delacour, as to carry food for the gold fishes to Helena -- you see that I have found out a way to keep my promise.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the boy Portman</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I'm afraid not,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Belinda; `for I am not going back to Lady Delacour<div class="bookquote">``s.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then I am very glad of it!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>said the boy, dropping the weed, and clapping his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) hands joyfully; `for then I hope you will always stay here, don't you, mamma? -- don't you, Mr Vincent? Oh, you do, I am sure, for I heard you say so to papa the other day! But what makes you grow so red?''

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) mother took him (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) by the hand, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) was going to repeat the question, and leading him (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) out of the room, desired him (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) to show her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) the place where he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) found the food for the gold fishes.

<p/>Belinda, to Mr Vincent's great relief, seemed not to take any notice of the child's question, nor to have any sympathy in his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) curiosity; she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) was intently copying Westall's sketch of Lady Anne Percival and her (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) family, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) had been roused, by the first mention of Helena Delacour's name, to many painful and some pleasing recollections. <div class="bookquote">``What a charming woman, and what a charming family!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr Vincent/Vincent</b></font>)</div>said Mr Vincent, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) looked at the drawing; `and how much more interesting is this picture of domestic happiness than all the pictures of shepherds and shepherdesses, and gods and goddesses, that ever were drawn!''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Belinda, `and how much more interesting this picture is to us, from our knowing that it is not a fancy-piece; that the happiness is real, not imaginary: that this is the natural expression of affection in the countenance of the mother; and that these children, who crowd round her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), are what they seem to be -- the pride and pleasure of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) life!''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There cannot,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr Vincent/Vincent</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Mr Vincent, with enthusiasm, `be a more delightful picture! Oh, Miss Portman, is it possible that you should not feel what you can paint so well?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it possible, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Belinda, `that you should suspect me of such wretched hypocrisy, as to affect to admire what I am incapable of feeling?''

<p/>``You misunderstand -- you totally misunderstand me. Hypocrisy! No; there is not a woman upon earth whom I believe to be so far above all hypocrisy, all affectation. But I imagined -- I feared -- '

<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) spoke these last words he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) was in some confusion, and hastily turned over the prints in a portfolio which lay upon the table. Belinda's eye was caught by an engraving of Lady Delacour in the character of the comic muse. Mr Vincent did not know the intimacy that had subsisted between her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) ladyship and Miss Portman -- she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) sighed from the recollection of Clarence Hervey, and of all that had passed at the masquerade.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What a contrast!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr Vincent/Vincent</b></font>)</div>said Mr Vincent, placing the print of Lady Delacour beside the picture of Lady Anne Percival, ``What a contrast! Compare their pictures -- compare their characters -- compare -- '

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Excuse me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>interrupted Belinda; <div class="bookquote">``Lady Delacour was once my friend, and I do not like to make a comparison so much to her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) disadvantage. I have never seen any woman who would not suffer by a comparison with Lady Anne Percival.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have been more fortunate, I have seen one -- one equally worthy of esteem -- admiration -- love.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr Vincent/Vincent</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr Vincent's voice faltered in pronouncing the word love; yet Belinda, prepossessed by the idea that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) was attached to some creole lady, simply answered, without looking up from her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) drawing, ``You are indeed very fortunate -- peculiarly fortunate. Are the West-Indian ladies -'

<p/><div class="bookquote">``West-Indian ladies!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr Vincent/Vincent</b></font>)</div>interrupted Mr Vincent. <div class="bookquote">``Surely, Miss Portman cannot imagine that I am at this instant thinking of any West-Indian lady!''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>Belinda looked up, with an air of surprise. <div class="bookquote">``Charming Miss Portman,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>continued he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``I have learnt to admire European beauty, European excellence! I have acquired new ideas of the female character -- ideas -- feelings that must henceforward render me exquisitely happy or exquisitely miserable.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Portman had been too often called `charming ' to be much startled or delighted by the sound: the word would have passed by unnoticed, but there was something so impassioned in Mr Vincent's manner, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) could no longer mistake it for common gallantry, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) was in evident confusion. Now for the first time the idea of Mr Vincent as a lover came into her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) mind: the next instant she (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) accused herself of vanity, and dreaded that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) should read her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) thoughts. <div class="bookquote">``Exquisitely miserable!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>), in a tone of raillery: <div class="bookquote">``I should not suppose, from what I have seen of Mr Vincent, that any thing could make him (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) exquisitely miserable.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then you do not know my character -- you do not know my heart: it is in your power to make me exquisitely miserable. Mine is not the cold, hackneyed phrase of gallantry, but the fervid language of passion,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>cried he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>), seizing her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) hand.

<p/>At this instant one of the children came in with some flowers to Belinda; and, glad of the interruption, she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) hastily put up her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) drawings and left the room, observing that she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) should scarcely have time to dress before dinner. However, as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) found herself alone, she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) forgot how late it was; and though she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) sat down before the glass to dress, she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) made no progress in the business, but continued for some time motionless, endeavouring to recollect and to understand all that had passed. The result of her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) reflections was the conviction that her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) partiality for Clarence Hervey was greater than she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) ever had till this moment suspected. <div class="bookquote">``I have told my aunt Stanhope,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>), `that the idea of Mr Hervey had no influence in my refusal of Sir Philip Baddely; I have said that my affections are entirely at my own command: then, why do I feel this alarm at the discovery of Mr Vincent's views? Why do I compare him (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) with one whom I thought I had forgotten? -- And yet how are we to judge of character? How can we form any estimate of what is amiable, of what will make us happy or miserable, but by comparison? Am I to blame for perceiving superiority? Am I to blame if one person be more agreeable, or seem to be more agreeable, than another? Am I to blame if I cannot love Mr Vincent?''

<p/>Before Belinda had answered these questions to her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) satisfaction, the dinner-bell rang. There happened to dine this day at Mr Percival's a gentleman, who had just arrived from Lisbon, and the conversation turned upon the sailors' practice of stilling the waves over the bar of Lisbon by throwing oil upon the water. Charles Percival's curiosity was excited by this conversation, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) wished to see the experiment. In the evening his (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) father indulged his (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) wishes. The children were delighted at the sight, and little Charles insisted upon Belinda's following him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) to a particular spot, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) was well convinced that she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) could see better than any where else in the world. <div class="bookquote">``Take care,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Anne/Lady Anne Percival/Percival</b></font>)</div>cried Lady Anne, `or you will lead your friend into the river, Charles.'' The boy paused, and soon afterwards asked his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) father several questions about swimming and drowning, and bringing people to life after they had been drowned. ``Don't you remember, papa,<div class="bookquote">'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), `that Mr Hervey, who was almost drowned in the Serpentine river in London?''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>-- Belinda coloured at hearing unexpectedly the name of the person of whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) was at that instant thinking, and the child continued -- <div class="bookquote">``I liked that Mr Hervey very much -- I liked him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) from the first day I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>). What a number of entertaining things he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) told us at dinner! We used to call him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) the good-natured gentleman: I like him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) very much -- I wish he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) was here this minute. Did you ever see him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>), Miss Portman? Oh, yes, you must have seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>); for it was he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) who carried Helena's gold fishes to her (<font color='blue'><b>Helena</b></font>) mother, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) used often to be at Lady Delacour's -- was not he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the child</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, my dear, often.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And did not you like him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) very much?''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>-- This simple question threw Belinda into inexpressible confusion: but fortunately the crimson on her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) face was seen only by Lady Anne Percival. To Belinda's great satisfaction, Mr Vincent forbore this evening any attempt to renew the conversation of the morning; he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) endeavoured to mix, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) usual animation and gaiety, in the family society; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) embarrassment was much lessened when she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) heard the next day,at breakfast, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) was gone to Harrowgate. Lady Anne Percival took notice that she (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) was this morning unusually sprightly.

<p/>After breakfast, as they were passing through the hall to take a walk in the park, one of the little boys stopped to look at a musical instrument which hung up against the wall.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is this, mamma? -- It is not a guitar, is it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, my dear, it is called a banjore; it is an African instrument, of which the negroes are particularly fond. Mr Vincent mentioned it the other day to Miss Portman, and I believe she (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) expressed some curiosity to see one. Juba went to work immediately to make a banjore, I find. Poor fellow! I dare say that he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) was very sorry to go to Harrowgate, and to leave his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) African guitar half finished; especially as it was intended for an offering to Miss Portman. He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) is the most grateful, affectionate creature I ever saw.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But why, mamma,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charles/Charles Percival</b></font>)</div>said Charles Percival, `is Mr Vincent gone away? I am sorry he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) is gone; I hope he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) will soon come back. In the mean time, I must run and water my carnations.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``His (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) sorrow for his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) friend Mr Vincent's departure does not seem to affect his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) spirits much,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Anne/Lady Anne Percival/Percival</b></font>)</div>said Lady Anne. <div class="bookquote">``People who expect sentiment from children of six years old will be disappointed, and will probably teach them affectation. Surely it is much better to let their natural affections have time to expand. If we tear the rosebud open we spoil the flower.''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>Belinda smiled at this parable of the rosebud, which, she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) said, might be applied to men and women, as well as to children.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And yet, upon reflection,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Anne/Lady Anne Percival/Percival</b></font>)</div>said Lady Anne, `the heart has nothing in common with a rosebud. Nonsensical allusions pass off very prettily in conversation. I mean, when we converse with partial friends: but we should reason ill, and conduct ourselves worse, if we were to trust implicitly to poetical analogies. Our affections,<div class="bookquote">'' continued Lady Anne, `arise from circumstances totally independent of our will.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is the very thing I meant to say,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>interrupted Belinda, eagerly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They are excited by the agreeable or useful qualities that we discover in things or in persons.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Undoubtedly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Belinda.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Or by those which our fancies discover,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Anne/Lady Anne Percival/Percival</b></font>)</div>said Lady Anne.

<p/>Belinda was silent; but, after a pause, she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``That it was certainly very dangerous, especially for women, to trust to fancy in bestowing their affections.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``And yet,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Anne/Lady Anne Percival/Percival</b></font>)</div>said Lady Anne, `it is a danger to which they are much exposed in society. Men have it in their power to assume the appearance of every thing that is amiable and estimable, and women have scarcely any opportunities of detecting the counterfeit.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Without Ithuriel's spear, how can they distinguish the good from the evil?''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Belinda. <div class="bookquote">``This is a common-place complaint, I know; the ready excuse that we silly young women plead, when we make mistakes for which our friends reproach us, and for which we too often reproach ourselves.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The complaint is common-place precisely because it is general and just,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Anne/Lady Anne Percival/Percival</b></font>)</div>replied Lady Anne. <div class="bookquote">``In the slight and frivolous intercourse, which fashionable belles usually have with those fashionable beaux who call themselves their lovers, it is surprising that they can discover any thing of each other's real character. Indeed they seldom do; and this probably is the cause why there are so many unsuitable and unhappy marriages. A woman who has an opportunity of seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) lover in private society, in domestic life, has infinite advantages; for if she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) has any sense, and he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) has any sincerity, the real character of both may perhaps be developed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``True,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Belinda -LRB-who now suspected that Lady Anne alluded to Mr Vincent-RRB-; `and in such a situation a woman would readily be able to decide whether the man who addressed her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would suit her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) taste or not; so she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would be inexcusable if, either from vanity or coquetry, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) disguised her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) real sentiments.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And will Miss Portman, who cannot, by any one to whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) is known, be suspected of vanity or coquetry, permit me to speak to her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) with the freedom of a friend?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div><p/>Belinda, touched by the kindness of Lady Anne's manner, pressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) hand, and exclaimed, <div class="bookquote">``Yes, dear Lady Anne, speak to me with freedom -- you cannot do me a greater favour. No thought of my mind, no secret feeling of my heart, shall be concealed from you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Anne/Lady Anne Percival/Percival</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do not imagine that I wish to encroach upon the generous openness of your temper,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Anne/Lady Anne Percival/Percival</b></font>)</div>said Lady Anne; `tell me when I go too far, and I will be silent. One who, like Miss Portman, has lived in the world, has seen a variety of characters, and probably has had a variety of admirers, must have formed some determinate idea of the sort of companion that would make her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) happy, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) were to marry -- unless,<div class="bookquote">'' said Lady Anne, `she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) has formed a resolution against marriage.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have formed no such resolution,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Belinda. ``Indeed, since I have seen the happiness which you and Mr Percival enjoy in your own family, I have been much more disposed to think that a union -- that a union such as yours, would increase my happiness. At the same time, my aversion to the idea of marrying from interest, or convenience, or from any motives but esteem and love, is increased almost to horror. O Lady Anne! there is nothing that I would not do to please the friends to whom I am under obligations, except sacrificing my peace of mind, or my integrity, the happiness of my life, by -- '

<p/>Lady Anne, in a gentle tone, assured her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>), that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was the last person in the world who would press her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) to any union which would make her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) unhappy. <div class="bookquote">``You perceive that Mr Vincent has spoken to me of what passed between you yesterday. You perceive that I am his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) friend, but do not forget that I am also yours. If you fear undue influence from any of your relations in favour of Mr Vincent's large fortune, &c. let his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) proposal remain a secret between ourselves, till you can decide, from farther acquaintance with him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>), whether it will be in your power to return his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) affection.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I fear, my dear Lady Anne,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>cried Belinda, `that it is not in my power to return his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) affection.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And may I ask your objections?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it not a sufficient objection, that I am persuaded I cannot love him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; for you may be mistaken in that persuasion. Remember what we said a little while ago, about fancy and spontaneous affections. Does Mr Vincent appear to you defective in any of the qualities which you think essential to happiness? Mr Percival has known him (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) from the time he (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) was a man, and can answer for his (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) integrity and his (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) good temper. Are not these the first points you would consider? They ought to be, I am sure, and I believe they are. Of his (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) understanding I shall say nothing, because you have had full opportunities of judging of it from his (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) conversation.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr Vincent appears to have a good understanding,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Belinda.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then to what do you object? -- Is there any thing disgusting to you in his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) person or manners?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) is very handsome, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) is well bred, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) manners are unaffected,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Belinda; `but -- do not accuse me of caprice -- altogether he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) does not suit my taste; and I cannot think it sufficient not to feel disgust for a husband -- though I believe this is the fashionable doctrine.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is not mine, I assure you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Anne/Lady Anne Percival/Percival</b></font>)</div>said Lady Anne. ``I am not one of those who think it ``safest to begin with a little aversion;<div class="bookquote">'' but since you acknowledge that Mr Vincent possesses the essential good qualities that entitle him (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) to your esteem, I am satisfied. We gradually acquire knowledge of the good qualities of those who endeavour to please us; and if they are really suitable, their persons become agreeable to us by degrees, when we become accustomed to them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Accustomed!''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Belinda, smiling: `one does grow accustomed even to disagreeable things certainly; but at this rate, my dear Lady Anne, I do not doubt but one might grow accustomed to Caliban.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My belief in the reconciling power of custom does not go quite so far,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Anne/Lady Anne Percival/Percival</b></font>)</div>said Lady Anne. <div class="bookquote">``It does not extend to Caliban, or even to the hero of La Belle et La Bête; but I do believe, that, in a mind so well regulated as yours, esteem may certainly in time be improved into love. I will tell Mr Vincent so, my dear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, my dear Lady Anne! no; you must not -- indeed you must not. You have too good an opinion of me -- my mind is not so well regulated -- I am much weaker, much sillier, than you imagine -- than you can conceive,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Belinda.

<p/>Lady Anne soothed her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) with the most affectionate expressions, and concluded with saying, <div class="bookquote">``Mr Vincent has promised not to return from Harrowgate, to torment you with his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) addresses, if you be absolutely determined against him (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) is of too generous, and perhaps too proud a temper, to persecute you with vain solicitations; and however Mr Percival and I may wish that he (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) could obtain such a wife, we shall have the common, or uncommon, sense and good-nature to allow our friends to be happy their own way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are very good -- too good. But am I then to be the cause of banishing Mr Vincent from all his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) friends -- from Oakly-park?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Will he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) not do what is most prudent, to avoid the charming Miss Portman,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Anne/Lady Anne Percival/Percival</b></font>)</div>said Lady Anne, smiling, `if he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) must not love her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)? This was at least the advice I gave him (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>), when he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) consulted us yesterday evening. But I will not sign his (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) writ of banishment lightly. Nothing but the assurance that the heart is engaged can be a sufficient cause for despair; nothing else could, in my eyes, justify you, my dear Belinda, from the charge of caprice.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can give you no such assurance, I hope -- I believe,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Belinda, in great confusion; `and yet I would not for the world deceive you: you have a right to my sincerity.'' She (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) paused; and Lady Anne said with a smile, ``Perhaps I can spare you the trouble of telling me in words what a blush told me, or at least made me suspect, yesterday evening, when we were standing by the river side, when little Charles asked you -- '

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I remember -- I saw you look at me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charles/Charles Percival</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Undesignedly, believe me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Undesignedly, I am sure; but I was afraid you would think -- '

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The truth.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; but more than the truth. The truth you shall hear, and the rest I will leave to your judgment and to your kindness.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div><p/>Belinda gave a full account of her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) acquaintance with Clarence Hervey; of the variations in his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) manner towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>); of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) excellent conduct with respect to Lady Delacour -LRB-of this, by-the-by, she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) spoke at large-RRB-. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) was more concise when she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) touched upon the state of her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) own heart; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) voice almost failed when she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) came to the history of the lock of beautiful hair, the Windsor incognita, and the picture of Virginia. She (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) concluded by expressing her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) conviction of the propriety of forgetting a man, who was in all probability attached to another, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) declared it to be her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) resolution to banish him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) from her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) thoughts. Lady Anne said, `that nothing could be more prudent or praiseworthy than forming such a resolution -- except keeping it.'' Lady Anne had a high opinion of Mr Hervey; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had no doubt, from Belinda's account, and from her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) own observations on Mr Hervey, and from slight circumstances which had accidentally come to Mr Percival's knowledge, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) was, as Belinda suspected, attached to another person. She (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) wished, therefore, to confirm Miss Portman in this belief, and to turn her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) thoughts towards one who, beside being deserving of her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) esteem and love, felt for her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) the most sincere affection. She (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) did not, however, press the subject farther at this time, but contented herself with requesting that Belinda would take three days -LRB-the usual time given for deliberation in fairy tales-RRB- before she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) should decide against Mr Vincent.

<p/>The next day they went to look at a porter's lodge, which Mr Percival had just built; it was inhabited by an old man and woman, who had for many years been industrious tenants, but who, in their old age, had been reduced to poverty, not by imprudence, but by misfortune. Lady Anne was pleased to see them comfortably settled in their new habitation; and whilst she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) and Belinda were talking to the old couple, their grand-daughter, a pretty looking girl of about eighteen, came in with a basket of eggs in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) hand. <div class="bookquote">``Well, Lucy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Anne/Lady Anne Percival/Percival</b></font>)</div>said Lady Anne, `have you overcome your dislike to James Jackson?'' The girl reddened, smiled, and looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) grand-mother, who answered for her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) in an arch tone, <div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes, my lady! We are not afraid of Jackson now; we are grown very great friends. This pretty cane chair for my good man was his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) handiwork, and these baskets he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) made for me. Indeed, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s a most industrious, ingenious, good-natured youth; and our Lucy takes no offence at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) courting her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) now, my lady, I can assure you. That necklace, which is never off her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) neck now, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) turned for her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), my lady; it is a present of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). So I tell him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) need not be discouraged, though so be she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) did not take to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) at the first; for she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)'s a good girl, and a sensible girl -- I say it, though she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)'s my own; and the eyes are used to a face after a time, and then it's nothing. They say, fancy's all in all in love: now in my judgment, fancy's little or nothing with girls that have sense. But I beg pardon for prating at this rate, more especially when I am so old as to have forgot all the little I ever knew about such things.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you have the best right in the world to speak about such things, and your grand-daughter has the best reason in the world to listen to you.''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Anne/Lady Anne Percival/Percival</b></font>)</div>said Lady Anne, `because, in spite of all the crosses of fortune, you have been an excellent and happy wife, at least ever since I can remember.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And ever since I can remember, that's more; no offence to your ladyship,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the old man, striking his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) crutch against the ground. <div class="bookquote">``Ever since I can remember, she (<font color='blue'><b>grand-daughter</b></font>) has made me the happiest man in the whole world, in the whole parish, as every body knows, and I best of all!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>cried he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), with a degree of enthusiasm that lighted up his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) aged countenance, and animated his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) feeble voice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And yet,''  (<font color='red'><b>the dame</b></font>)</div>said the honest dame, `if I had followed my fancy, and taken up with my first love, it would not ha`been with he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), Lucy. I had a sort of a fancy -LRB-since my lady's so good as to let me speak-RRB-, I had a sort of a fancy for an idle young man; but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), very luckily for me, took it into his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head to fall in love with another young woman, and then I had leisure enough left me to think of your grandfather, who was not so much to my taste like at first. But when I found out his (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) goodness and cleverness, and joined to all, his (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) great tenderness for me, I thought better of it, Lucy -LRB-as who knows but you may do, though there shall not be a word said on my part to press you, for poor Jackson?-RRB-; and my thinking better is the cause why I have been so happy ever since, and am so still in my old age. Ah, Lucy! dear, what a many years that same old age lasts, after all! But young folks, for the most part, never think what's to come after thirty or forty at farthest. But I don't say this for you, Lucy; for you are a good girl, and a sensible girl, though my own grand-daughter, as I said before, and therefore won't be run away with by fancy, which is soon past and gone: but make a prudent choice, that you won't never have cause to repent of. But I'll not say a word more; I'll leave it all to yourself and James Jackson.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You do right,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Anne/Lady Anne Percival/Percival</b></font>)</div>said Lady Anne: `good morning to you! Farewell, Lucy! That's a pretty necklace, and is very becoming to you -- fare ye well!''

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) hurried out of the cottage with Belinda, apprehensive that the talkative old dame might weaken the effect of her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) good sense and experience by a farther profusion of words.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``One would think,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Belinda, with an ingenuous smile, `that this lesson upon the dangers of fancy was intended for me: at any rate, I may turn it to my own advantage!''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Happy those who can turn all the experience of others to their own advantage!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Anne/Lady Anne Percival/Percival</b></font>)</div>said Lady Anne: `this would be a more valuable privilege than the power of turning every thing that is touched to gold.''

<p/>They walked on in silence for a few minutes; and then Miss Portman, pursuing the train of her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) own thoughts, and unconscious that she (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) had not explained them to Lady Anne, abruptly exclaimed, <div class="bookquote">``But if I should be entangled, so as not to be able to retract! -- and if it should not be in my power to love him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) at last, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) will think me a coquette, a jilt, perhaps: he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) will have reason to complain of me, if I waste his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) time, and trifle with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) affections. Then is it not better that I should avoid, by a decided refusal, all possibility of injury to Mr Vincent, and of blame to myself?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Anne/Lady Anne Percival/Percival</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There is no danger of Mr Vincent's misunderstanding or misrepresenting you. The risk that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) runs is by his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) voluntary choice; and I am sure that if, after farther acquaintance with him (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>), you find it impossible to return his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) affections, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) will not consider himself as ill-used by your refusal.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But after a certain time -- after the world suspects that two people are engaged to each other, it is scarcely possible for the woman to recede: when they come within a certain distance, they are pressed to unite, by the irresistible force of external circumstances. A woman is too often reduced to this dilemma: either she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) must marry a man she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) does not love, or she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) must be blamed by the world -- either she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) must sacrifice a portion of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) reputation, or the whole of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) happiness.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The world is indeed often too curious, and too rash in these affairs,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Anne/Lady Anne Percival/Percival</b></font>)</div>said Lady Anne. ``A young woman is not in this respect allowed sufficient time for freedom of deliberation. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) sees, as Mr Percival once said, <div class="bookquote">``the drawn sword of tyrant custom suspended over her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) head by a single hair.'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And yet, notwithstanding you are so well aware of the danger, your ladyship would expose me to it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Belinda.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; for I think the chance of happiness, in this instance, overbalances the risk,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Anne/Lady Anne Percival/Percival</b></font>)</div>said Lady Anne. <div class="bookquote">``As we cannot alter the common law of custom, and as we cannot render the world less gossiping, or less censorious, we must not expect always to avoid censure; all we can do is, never to deserve it -- and it would be absurd to enslave ourselves to the opinion of the idle and ignorant. To a certain point, respect for the opinion of the world is prudence; beyond that point, it is weakness. You should also consider that the world at Oakly-park and in London are two different worlds. In London if you and Mr Vincent were seen often in each other's company, it would be immediately buzzed about that Miss Portman and Mr Vincent were going to be married; and if the match did not take place, a thousand foolish stories might be told to account for its being broken off. But here you are not surrounded by busy eyes and busy tongues. The butchers, bakers, ploughmen, and spinsters, who compose our world, have all affairs of their own to mind. Besides, their comments can have no very extensive circulation; they are used to see Mr Vincent continually here; and his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) staying with us the remainder of the autumn will not appear to them any thing wonderful or portentous.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Their conversation was interrupted. Mr Vincent returned to Oakly-park -- but upon the express condition that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) should not make his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) attachment public by any particular attentions, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) should draw no conclusions in his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) favour from Belinda's consenting to converse with him (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) freely upon every common subject. To this treaty of amity Lady Anne Percival was guarantee.

<p/>CHAPTER XIX

<p/>A Wedding

<p/>BELINDA and Mr Vincent could never agree in their definition of the word flattery; so that there were continual complaints on the one hand of a breach of treaty, and, on the other, solemn protestations of the most scrupulous adherence to his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) compact. However this might be, it is certain that the gentleman gained so much, either by truth or fiction, that, in the course of some weeks, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) got the lady as far as `gratitude and esteem.''

<p/>One evening, Belinda was playing with little Charles Percival at spillikins. Mr Vincent, who found pleasure in every thing that amused Belinda, and Mr Percival, who took an interest in every thing which entertained his (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) children, were looking on at this simple game.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr Percival,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Belinda, `condescending to look at a game of jack-straws!''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Anne/Lady Anne Percival/Percival</b></font>)</div>said Lady Anne; `for he (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) is of Dryden's opinion, that, if a straw can be made the instrument of happiness, he (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) is a wise man who does not despise it.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! Miss Portman, take care!''  (<font color='red'><b>Charles/Charles Percival</b></font>)</div>cried Charles, who was anxious that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) should win, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) was playing against her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Take care! don't touch that knave.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I would lay a hundred guineas upon the steadiness of Miss Portman's hand,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr Vincent/Vincent</b></font>)</div>cried Mr Vincent.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll lay you sixpence, though,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charles/Charles Percival</b></font>)</div>cried Charles, eagerly, `that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)'ll stir the king, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) touches that knave -- I'll lay you a shilling.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Done! done!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr Vincent/Vincent</b></font>)</div>cried Mr Vincent.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Done! done!''  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div>cried the boy, stretching out his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) hand, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) father caught it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Softly! softly, Charles! -- No betting, if you please, my dear. Done and done sometimes ends in -- undone.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It was my fault -- it was I who was in the wrong,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr Vincent/Vincent</b></font>)</div>cried Vincent immediately.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sure you are in the right, now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr Percival</b></font>)</div>said Mr Percival; `and, what is better than my saying so, Miss Portman thinks so, so her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) smile tells me.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You moved, Miss Portman!''  (<font color='red'><b>Charles</b></font>)</div>cried Charles: -- <div class="bookquote">``Oh, indeed! the king's head stirred, the very instant papa spoke. I knew it was impossible that you could get that knave clear off without shaking the king. Now, papa, only look how they were balanced.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charles</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I grant you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr Vincent/Vincent</b></font>)</div>said Mr Vincent, <div class="bookquote">``I should have made an imprudent bet. So it is well I made none; for now I see the chances were ten to one, twenty to one, a hundred to one against me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr Vincent/Vincent</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It does not appear to me to be a matter of chance,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr Percival</b></font>)</div>said Mr Percival. <div class="bookquote">``This is a game of address, not chance, and that is the reason I like it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, papa! Oh, Miss Portman! look how nicely these are balanced. There! my breath has set them in motion. Look, they shake, shake, shake, like the great rocking-stones at Brimham Crags.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is comparing small things to great, indeed!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr Percival</b></font>)</div>said Mr Percival.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``By-the-by,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr Vincent/Vincent</b></font>)</div>cried Mr Vincent, <div class="bookquote">``Miss Portman has never seen those wonderful rocking-stones -- suppose we were to ride to seen them tomorrow?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr Vincent/Vincent</b></font>)</div><p/>The proposal was warmly seconded by the children, and agreed to by every one. It was settled, that after they had seen Brimham Crags they should spend the remainder of the day at Lord C--'s beautiful place in the neighborhood.

<p/>The next morning was neither too hot nor too cold, and they set out on their little party of pleasure; the children went with their mother, to their great delight, in the sociable; and Mr Vincent, to his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) great delight, rode with Belinda. When they came within sight of the Crags, Mr Percival, who was riding with them, exclaimed -- <div class="bookquote">``What is that yonder, on the top of one of the great rocking-stones?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr Percival</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It looks like a statue,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr Vincent/Vincent</b></font>)</div>said Vincent. <div class="bookquote">``It has been put up since we were here last.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I fancy it has got up of itself,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Belinda, `for it seems to be getting down of itself. I think I saw it stoop. Oh! I see now, it is a man who has got up there, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) seems to have a gun in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand, has not he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)? He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is going through his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) manual exercise for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) diversion -- for the diversion of the spectators below, I perceive -- there is a party of people looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Him (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr Percival</b></font>)</div>said Mr Percival.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I protest it is a woman!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr Vincent/Vincent</b></font>)</div>said Vincent.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, surely,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Belinda: `it cannot be a woman!''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not unless it be Mrs Freke,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr Percival</b></font>)</div>replied Mr Percival.

<p/>In fact it was Mrs Freke, who had been out shooting with a party of gentlemen, and who had scrambled upon this rocking-stone, on the summit of which she (<font color='blue'><b>Freke</b></font>) went through the manual exercise at the word of command from her (<font color='blue'><b>Freke</b></font>) officer. As they rode nearer to the scene of action, Belinda heard the shrill screams of a female voice, and they descried amongst the gentlemen a slight figure in a riding habit.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Moreton, I suppose,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr Vincent/Vincent</b></font>)</div>said Mr Vincent.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Poor girl! what are they doing with her (<font color='blue'><b>Moreton</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>cried Belinda. <div class="bookquote">``They seem to be forcing her (<font color='blue'><b>Moreton</b></font>) up to the top of that place, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Moreton</b></font>) has no mind to go. Look how Mrs Freke drags her (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>) up by the arm!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Freke</b></font>)</div><p/>As they drew nearer, they heard Mrs Freke laughing loud as she (<font color='blue'><b>Freke</b></font>) rocked this frightened girl upon the top of the stone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We had better keep out of the way, I think,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Belinda: `for perhaps, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) has vowed vengeance against me, she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) might take a fancy to setting me upon that pinnacle of glory.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>) dare not,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr Vincent/Vincent</b></font>)</div>cried Vincent, his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) eyes flashing with anger: `you may trust to us to defend you.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly! -- But I will not run into danger on purpose to give you the pleasure of defending me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Belinda; and as she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) spoke, she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) horse another way.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You won't turn back, Miss Portman?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr Vincent/Vincent</b></font>)</div>cried Vincent eagerly, laying his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) hand on her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) bridle. -- <div class="bookquote">``Good Heavens, ma'am! we can't run away! -- We came here to look at these rocking-stones! -- We have not half seen them. Lady Anne and the children will be here immediately. You would not deprive them of the pleasure of seeing these things!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I doubt whether they would have much pleasure in seeing some of these things! and as to the rest, if I disappoint the children now, Mr Percival will perhaps, have the goodness to bring them some other day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr Percival</b></font>)</div>said Mr Percival: <div class="bookquote">``Miss Portman shows her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) usual prudence.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr Percival</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The children are so good tempered, that I am sure they will forgive me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>continued Belinda; `and Mr Vincent will be ashamed not to follow their example, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) seems to be rather angry with me at present for obliging him (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) to turn back -- out of the path of danger.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You must not be surprised at that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr Percival</b></font>)</div>said Mr Percival, laughing; `for Mr Vincent is a lover and a hero. You know it is a ruled case, in all romances, that when a lover and his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) mistress go out riding together, some adventure must befall them. The horse must run away with the lady, and the gentleman must catch her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) arms just as her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) neck is about to be broken. If the horse has been too well trained for the heroine's purpose, <div class="bookquote">``some footpad, bandit fierce, or mountaineer,''  (<font color='red'><b>the heroine</b></font>)</div>some jealous rival must make his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) appearance quite unexpectedly at the turn of a road, and the lady must be carried off -- robes flying -- hair streaming -- like Buerger's Leonora. Then her (<font color='blue'><b>Leonora</b></font>) lover must come to her (<font color='blue'><b>Leonora</b></font>) rescue just in the proper moment. But if the damsel cannot conveniently be run away with, she (<font color='blue'><b>damsel</b></font>) must, as the last resource, tumble into a river to make herself interesting, and the hero must be at least half drowned in dragging her (<font color='blue'><b>damsel</b></font>) out, that she (<font color='blue'><b>damsel</b></font>) may be under eternal obligations to him (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>), and at last be forced to marry him (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) out of pure gratitude.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Gratitude!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr Vincent/Vincent</b></font>)</div>interrupted Mr Vincent: `he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) is no hero, to my mind, who would be content with gratitude, instead of love.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You need not alarm yourself: Miss Portman does not seem inclined to put you to the trial, you see,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr Percival</b></font>)</div>said Mr Percival, smiling. <div class="bookquote">``Now it is really to be regretted, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) deprived you of an opportunity of fighting some of the gentlemen in Mrs Freke's train, or of delivering her (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>) from the perilous height of one of those rocking-stones. It would have been a new incident in a novel.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How that poor girl screamed!''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Belinda. <div class="bookquote">``Was her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) terror real or affected!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Partly real, partly affected, I fancy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr Percival</b></font>)</div>said Mr Percival.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I pity her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr Vincent/Vincent</b></font>)</div>said Mr Vincent; `for Mrs Freke leads her (<font color='blue'><b>Freke</b></font>) a weary life.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) is certainly to be pitied, but also to be blamed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr Percival</b></font>)</div>said Mr Percival. <div class="bookquote">``You do not know her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) history. Miss Moreton ran away from her (<font color='blue'><b>Moreton</b></font>) friends to live with this Mrs Freke, who had led her (<font color='blue'><b>Freke</b></font>) into all kinds of mischief and absurdity. The girl is weak and vain, and believes that every thing becomes her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) which Mrs Freke assures her (<font color='blue'><b>Freke</b></font>) is becoming. At one time she (<font color='blue'><b>Freke</b></font>) was persuaded to go to a public ball with her (<font color='blue'><b>Freke</b></font>) arms as bare as Juno's, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Freke</b></font>) feet as naked as Mad Tallien's. At another time Miss Moreton -LRB-who unfortunately has never heard the Greek proverb, that half is better than the whole,-RRB- was persuaded by Mrs Freke to lay aside her (<font color='blue'><b>Freke</b></font>) half boots, and to equip herself in men's whole boots; and thus she (<font color='blue'><b>Freke</b></font>) rode about the country, to the amazement of all the world. These are trifles; but women who love to set the world at defiance in trifles seldom respect its opinion in matters of consequence. Miss Moreton's whole boots in the morning, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Moreton</b></font>) bare feet in the evening, were talked of by every body, till she (<font color='blue'><b>Moreton</b></font>) gave them more to talk of about her (<font color='blue'><b>Moreton</b></font>) attachment to a young officer. Mrs Freke, whose philosophy is professedly latitudinarian in morals, laughed at the girl's prejudice in favour of the ceremony of marriage. So did the officer; for Miss Moreton had no fortune. It is suspected that the young lady did not feel the difficulty, which philosophers are sometimes said to find in suiting their practice to their theory. The unenlightened world reprobated the theory much, and the practice more. I am inclined, in spite of scandal, to think the poor girl was only imprudent: at all events, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) repents her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) folly too late. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) has now no friend upon earth but Mrs Freke, who is, in fact, her (<font color='blue'><b>Freke</b></font>) worst enemy, and who tyrannizes over her (<font color='blue'><b>Freke</b></font>) without mercy. Imagine what it is to be the butt of a buffoon!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What a lesson to young ladies in the choice of female friends!''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Belinda. <div class="bookquote">``But had Miss Moreton no relations, who could interfere to get her (<font color='blue'><b>Moreton</b></font>) out of Mrs Freke's hands?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Her (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>) father and mother were old, and, what is more contemptible, old-fashioned: she (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>) would not listen to their advice; she (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>) ran away from them. Some of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>) relations were, I believe, willing that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>) should stay with Mrs Freke, because she (<font color='blue'><b>Freke</b></font>) was a dashing, fashionable woman, and they thought it might be what is called an advantage to her (<font color='blue'><b>Freke</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Freke</b></font>) had one relation, indeed, who was quite of a different opinion, who saw the danger of her (<font color='blue'><b>Freke</b></font>) situation, and remonstrated in the strongest manner -- but to no purpose. This was a cousin of Miss Moreton's, a respectable clergyman. Mrs Freke was so much incensed by his (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) insolent interference, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Freke</b></font>) was pleased to call it, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Freke</b></font>) made an effigy of Mr Moreton dressed in his (<font color='blue'><b>Moreton</b></font>) canonicals, and hung the figure up as a scarecrow in a garden close by the high road. He (<font color='blue'><b>Moreton</b></font>) was so much beloved and respected for his (<font color='blue'><b>Moreton</b></font>) benevolence and unaffected piety, that Mrs Freke totally failed in her (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>) design of making him (<font color='blue'><b>Moreton</b></font>) ridiculous; her (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>) scarecrow was torn to pieces by his (<font color='blue'><b>scarecrow</b></font>) parishioners; and though, in the true spirit of charity, he (<font color='blue'><b>scarecrow</b></font>) did all he (<font color='blue'><b>scarecrow</b></font>) could to moderate their indignation against his (<font color='blue'><b>scarecrow</b></font>) enemy, the lady became such an object of detestation, that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was followed with hisses and groans whenever she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) appeared, and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) dared not venture within ten miles of the village.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mrs Freke now changed the mode of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>) persecution: she (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>) was acquainted with a nobleman from whom our clergyman expected a living, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>) worked upon his (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) lordship so successfully, that he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) insisted upon having an apology made to the lady. Mr Moreton had as much dignity of mind as gentleness of character; his (<font color='blue'><b>Moreton</b></font>) forbearance was that of principle, and so was his (<font color='blue'><b>Moreton</b></font>) firmness: he (<font color='blue'><b>Moreton</b></font>) refused to make the concessions that were required. His (<font color='blue'><b>Moreton</b></font>) noble patron bullied. Though he (<font color='blue'><b>Moreton</b></font>) had a large family to provide for, the clergyman would not degrade himself by any improper submission. The incumbent died, and the living was given to a more compliant friend. So ends the history of one of Mrs Freke's numerous frolics.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``This was the story,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr Vincent/Vincent</b></font>)</div>said Mr Vincent, `which effectually changed my opinion of her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>). Till I heard it, I always looked upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) as one of those thoughtless, good-natured people, who, as the common saying is, do nobody any harm but themselves.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is difficult in society,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr Percival</b></font>)</div>said Mr Percival, `especially for women, to do harm to themselves, without doing harm to others. They may begin in frolic, but they must end in malice. They defy the world -- the world in return excommunicates them -- the female outlaws become desperate, and make it the business and pride of their lives to disturb the peace of their sober neighbours. Women who have lowered themselves in the public opinion cannot rest without attempting to bring others to their own level.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mrs Freke, notwithstanding the blustering merriment that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>) affects, is obviously unhappy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Belinda; `and since we cannot do her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) any good, either by our blame or our pity, we had better think of something else.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Scandal,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr Vincent/Vincent</b></font>)</div>said Mr Vincent, `does not seem to give you much pleasure, Miss Portman. You will be glad to hear that Mrs Freke's malice against poor Mr Moreton has not ruined him (<font color='blue'><b>Moreton</b></font>). Do you know Mr Percival, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) has just been presented to a good living by a generous young man, who heard of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) excellent conduct?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am extremely glad of it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr Percival</b></font>)</div>said Mr Percival. <div class="bookquote">``Who is this generous young man? I should like to be acquainted with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So should I,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr Vincent/Vincent</b></font>)</div>said Mr Vincent: `he (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) is a Mr Hervey.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Clarence Hervey, perhaps?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Clarence was his (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) name.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No man more likely to do a generous action than Clarence Hervey,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr Percival</b></font>)</div>said Mr Percival.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nobody more likely to do a generous action than Mr Hervey,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>repeated Belinda, in a rather low tone. She (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) could now praise Clarence Hervey without blushing, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) could think even of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) generosity without partiality, though not without pleasure. By strength of mind, and timely exertion, she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) had prevented her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) prepossession from growing into a passion that might have made her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) miserable. Proud of this conquest over herself, she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) was now disposed to treat Mr Vincent with more favour than usual. Self-complacency generally puts us in good-humour with our friends.

<p/>After spending some pleasant hours in Lord C--'s beautiful grounds, where the children explored to their satisfaction every dingle and bushy dell, they returned home in the cool of the evening. Mr Vincent thought it the most delightful evening he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) had ever felt.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What! as charming as a West Indian evening?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr Percival</b></font>)</div>said Mr Percival. <div class="bookquote">``This is more than I expected ever to hear you acknowledge in favour of England. Do you remember how you used to rave of the climate and of the prospects of Jamaica?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, but my taste has quite changed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I remember the time,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr Percival</b></font>)</div>said Mr Percival, `when you thought it impossible that your taste should ever change; when you told me that taste, whether for the beauties of animate or inanimate nature, was immutable.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You and Miss Portman have taught me better sense. First loves are generally silly things,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>added he (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>), colouring a little. Belinda coloured also.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``First loves,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr Percival</b></font>)</div>continued Mr Percival, `are not necessarily more foolish than others; but the chances are certainly against them. From poetry or romance, young people usually form their earlier ideas of love, before they have actually felt the passion; and the image which they have in their own minds of the beau ideal is cast upon the first objects they afterward behold. This, if I may be allowed the expression, is Cupid's Fata Morgana. Deluded mortals are in ecstasy whilst the illusion lasts, and in despair when it vanishes.''

<p/>Mr Percival appeared to be unconscious that what he (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) was saying was any way applicable to Belinda. He (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) addressed himself to Mr Vincent solely, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) listened at her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) ease.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>), `do not you think that this prejudice, as I am willing to allow it to be, in favour of first loves, may in our sex be advantageous? Even when a woman may be convinced that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) ought not to indulge a first love, should she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) not be prevented by delicacy from thinking of a second?''

<p/>``Delicacy, my dear Miss Portman, is a charming word, and a still more charming thing, and Mrs Freke has probably increased our affection for it; but even delicacy, like all other virtues, must be judged of by the test of utility. We should run into romance, and error, and misery, if we did not constantly refer to this standard. Our reasonings as to the conduct of life, as far as moral prudence is concerned, must depend ultimately upon facts. Now, of the numbers of people in this world, how many do you think have married their first loves? Probably not one out of ten. Then, would you have nine out of ten pine all their lives in celibacy, or fret in matrimony, because they cannot have the persons who first struck their fancy? '

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I acknowledge this would not add to the happiness of society,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Belinda.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nor to its virtue,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr Percival</b></font>)</div>said Mr Percival. <div class="bookquote">``I scarcely know an idea more dangerous to domestic happiness than this belief in the unextinguishable nature of a first flame. There are people who would persuade us that, though it may be smothered for years, it must break out at last, and blaze with destructive fury. Pernicious doctrine! false as it is pernicious! -- The struggles between duty and passion may be the charm of romance, but must be the misery of real life. The woman who marries one man, and loves another, who, in spite of all that an amiable and estimable husband can do to win her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) confidence and affection, nourishes in secret a fatal prepossession for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) first love, may perhaps, by the eloquence of a fine writer, be made an interesting heroine; -- but would any man of sense or feeling choose to be troubled with such a wife? -- Would not even the idea that women admired such conduct necessarily tend to diminish our confidence, if not in their virtue, at least in their sincerity? And would not this suspicion destroy our happiness? Husbands may sometimes have delicate feelings as well as their wives, though they are seldom allowed to have any by these unjust novel writers. Now, could a husband who has any delicacy be content to possess the person without the mind? -- the duty without the love? -- Could he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) be perfectly happy, if, in the fondest moments, he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) might doubt whether he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) were an object of disgust or affection? -- whether the smiles of apparent joy were only the efforts of a suffering martyr? -- Thank Heaven! I am not married to one of these charming martyrs. Let those live with them who admire them. For my part, I admire and love the wife who not only seems but is happy -- as I,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr Percival</b></font>)</div>added Mr Percival smiling, `have the fond credulity to believe. If I have spoken too long or too warmly upon the chapter of first loves, I have at least been a perfectly disinterested declaimer; for I can assure you, Miss Portman, that I do not suspect Lady Anne Percival of sighing in secret for some vision of perfection, any more than she (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) suspects me of pining for the charming Lady Delacour, who, perhaps, you may have heard was my first love. In these days, however, so few people marry with even the pretence to love of any sort, that you will think I might have spared this tirade. No; there are ingenuous minds which will never be enslaved by fashion or interest, though they may be exposed to be deceived by romance, or by the delicacy of their own imaginations.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Belinda, smiling, <div class="bookquote">``I hear and understand the emphasis with which you pronounce that word delicacy. I see you have not forgotten that I used it improperly half an hour ago, as you have convinced me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Happy they,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr Percival</b></font>)</div>said Mr Percival, `who can be convinced in half an hour! There are some people who cannot be convinced in a whole life, and who end where they begin, with saying -- <div class="bookquote">``This is my opinion -- I always thought so, and always shall.'' (<font color='red'><b>some people</b></font>)</div>'

<p/>Mr Vincent at all times loved Mr Percival; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) never felt so much affection for him (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) did this evening, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) arguments appeared to him (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) unanswerable. Though Belinda had never mentioned to Mr Vincent the name of Clarence Hervey till this day, and though he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) did not in the least suspect from her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) manner that this gentleman ever possessed any interest in her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) heart; yet, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) accustomed sincerity, she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) had confessed to him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) that an impression had been made upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) mind before she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) came to Oakly-park.

<p/>After this conversation with Mr Percival, Mr Vincent perceived that he (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) gained ground more rapidly in her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) favour; and his (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) company grew every day more agreeable to her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) taste: he (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) was convinced that, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) possessed her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) esteem, he (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) should in time secure her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) affections.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``In time,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Anne/Lady Anne Percival/Percival</b></font>)</div>repeated Lady Anne Percival: `you must allow her (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) time, or you will spoil all.''

<p/>It was with some difficulty that Mr Vincent restrained his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) impatience, even though he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) was persuaded of the prudence of his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) friend's advice. Things went on in this happy, but as he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) thought slow, state of progression till towards the latter end of September.

<p/>One fine morning Lady Anne Percival came into Belinda's room with a bridal favour in her (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) hand. <div class="bookquote">``Do you know,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>), `that we are to have a wedding to-day? This favour has just been sent to my maid. Lucy, the pretty girl whom you may remember to have seen some time ago with that prettily turned necklace, is the bride, and James Jackson is the bride-groom. Mr Vincent has let them a very pretty little farm in the neighbourhood, and -- hark! there's the sound of music.''

<p/>They looked out of the window, and they saw a troop of villagers, gaily dressed, going to the wedding. Lady Anne, who was always eager to promote innocent festivity, sent immediately to have a tent pitched in the park; and all the rural company were invited to a dance in the evening: it was a very cheerful spectacle. Belinda heard from all sides praises of Mr Vincent's generosity; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) could not be insensible to the simple but enthusiastic testimony which Juba bore to his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) master's goodness. Juba had composed, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) broken dialect, a little song in honour of his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) master, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) sang to his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) banjore with the most touching expression of joyful gratitude. In some of the stanzas Belinda could distinguish that her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) own name was frequently repeated. Lady Anne called him (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>), and desired to have the words of this song. They were a mixture of English and of his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) native language; they described in the strongest manner what had been his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) feelings whilst he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) was under the terror of Mrs Freke's fiery obeah-woman, then his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) joy on being relieved from these horrors, with the delightful sensations of returning health; -- and thence he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) suddenly passed to his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) gratitude to Belinda, the person to whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) owed his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) recovery. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) concluded with wishing her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) all sorts of happiness, and, above all, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) might be fortunate in her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) love; which Juba thought the highest degree of felicity. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) had no sooner finished his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) song, which particularly touched and pleased Miss Portman, than he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) begged his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) master to offer to her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) the little instrument, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) had made with much pains and ingenuity. She (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) accepted the banjore with a smile that enchanted Mr Vincent; but at this instant they were startled by the sound of a carriage driving rapidly into the park. Belinda looked up, and between the heads of the dancers she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) just caught a glimpse of a well-known livery. <div class="bookquote">``Good heavens!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) exclaimed, <div class="bookquote">``Lady Delacour's carriage! -- Can it be Lady Delacour!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>The carriage stopped, and Marriott hastily jumped out of it. Belinda pressed forward to meet her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>); poor Marriott was in great agitation: -- <div class="bookquote">``Oh, Miss Portman! my poor lady is very ill -- very ill, indeed. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) has sent me for you -- here's her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) letter. Dear Miss Portman, I hope you won't refuse to come; she (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) has been very ill, and is very ill; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) would be better, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) could see you again. But I'll tell every thing, ma'am, when we are by ourselves, and when you have read your letter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Marriott/Mrs Marriott</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Portman immediately accompanied Marriott towards the house; and as they walked thither, she (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) learned that Lady Delacour had applied to the quack-doctor in whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) had such implicit faith, and had in vain endeavoured to engage him (<font color='blue'><b>dancers</b></font>) to perform for her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) the operation to which she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) had determined to submit. He (<font color='blue'><b>dancers</b></font>) was afraid to hazard it, and he (<font color='blue'><b>dancers</b></font>) prevailed upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) to give up the scheme, and to try some new external remedy from which he (<font color='blue'><b>dancers</b></font>) promised wonders. No one knew what his (<font color='blue'><b>dancers</b></font>) medicines were, but they affected her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) head in the most alarming manner.

<p/>In her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) delirium she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) called frequently upon Miss Portman; sometimes accusing her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) of the basest treachery, sometimes addressing her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) were present, and pouring forth the warmest expressions of friendship. ``In her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) lucid intervals, ma``am,<div class="bookquote">'' continued Marriott, `she (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) for some weeks scarcely ever mentioned your name, nor could bear to hear me mention it. One day, when I was saying how much I wished that you were with her (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) again, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) darted at me the most terrible look that ever I beheld.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>'<div class="bookquote">``When I am in my grave, Marriott,''  (<font color='red'><b>lady</b></font>)</div>cried my lady, <div class="bookquote">``it will be time enough for Miss Portman again to visit this house, and you may then express your attachment to her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) with more propriety than at present.''  (<font color='red'><b>lady</b></font>)</div>These were my lady's own words -- I shall never forget them: they struck and astonished me, ma'am, so much, I stood like one stupefied, and then left the room to think them over again by myself, and make sense of them, if I could. Well, ma'am, to be sure, it then struck me like a flash of lightning, that my lady was jealous -- and, begging your pardon, ma'am -- of you. This seemed to me the most unnatural thing in the world, considering how easy my lady had always seemed to be about my lord; but it was now clear to me, that this was the cause of your leaving us so suddenly, ma'am. Well, I was confident that Mr Champfort was at the bottom of the business from the first; and now that I knew what accent to go upon, I went to work with fresh spirit to find him (<font color='blue'><b>Champfort</b></font>) out, which was a thing I was determined upon -- and what I'm determined upon, I generally do, ma'am. So I put together things about Miss Portman and my lord, that had dropped at odd times from Sir Philip Baddely's gentleman; and I, partly serious and partly flirting, which in a good cause is no sin, drew from him (<font color='blue'><b>Baddely</b></font>) -LRB-for he (<font color='blue'><b>Baddely</b></font>) pretends to be a little an admirer of mine, ma'am, though I never gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Baddely</b></font>) the smallest encouragement-RRB- all he (<font color='blue'><b>Baddely</b></font>) knew or suspected, or had heard reported, or whispered; and out it came, ma'am, that Mr Champfort was the original of all; and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Champfort</b></font>) had told a heap of lies about some bank-notes that my lord had given you, and that you and my lord were to be married as soon as my lady was dead; and I don't know what, which he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) maliciously circulated through Sir Philip's gentleman to Sir Philip himself, and so round again to my lady. Now, Sir Philip's man behaved like a gentleman upon the occasion, which I shall ever be free to acknowledge and remember: and when I represented things properly, and made him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) sensible of the mischief, which, he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) assured me, was done purely with an eye to serve Sir Philip, his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) master, he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) very candidly offered to assist me to unmask that villain Champfort, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) could easily do with the assistance of a few bottles of claret, and a few fair words; which, though I can't abide hypocrisy, I thought quite allowable upon such an occasion. So, ma'am, when Mr Champfort was thrown off his (<font color='blue'><b>Champfort</b></font>) guard by the claret, Sir Philip's gentleman began to talk of my lord and my lady, and Miss Portman; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) observed that my lord and my lady were coming together more than they used to be since Miss Portman left the house. To which Champfort replied with an oath, like an unmannered reprobate as he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) is, and in his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) gibberish, French and English, which I can't speak; but the sense of it was this: -- <div class="bookquote">``My lord and lady shall never come together, if I can help it. It was to hinder this I got Miss Portman banished; for my lord was quite another man after she (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) got Miss Helena into the house; and I don't doubt but he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) might have been brought to leave off his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) burgundy, and set up for a sober, regular man; which would not suit me at all. If my lady once was to get power over him (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) again, I might go whistle -- so -LRB-with another reprobate oath-RRB- my lord and my lady shall never come together again whilst I live.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>``Well, ma``am,'' continued Marriott, `as soon as I was in possession of this precious speech, I carried it and a letter of Sir Philip Baddely's gentleman vouching it to my lady. My lady was thunderstruck, and so vexed to have been, as she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said, a dupe, that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) sent for my lord directly, and insisted upon his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) giving up Mr Champfort. My lord demurred, because my lady spoke so high, and said insist. He (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) would have done it, I'm satisfied, of his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) own accord with the greatest pleasure, if my lady had not, as it were, commanded it. But he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) answered at last, ``My Lady Delacour, I'm not a man to be governed by a wife -- I shall keep or part with my own servants in my own house, according to my own pleasure;'' and saying so, he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) left the room. I never saw my lady so angry as she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was at this refusal of my lord to part with him (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>). The house was quite in a state of distraction for some days. I never would sit down to the same table, ma'am, with Mr Champfort, nor speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>Champfort</b></font>), nor look at him (<font color='blue'><b>Champfort</b></font>), and parties ran high above and below stairs. And at last my lady, who had been getting better, took to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) bed again with a nervous fever, which brought her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) almost to death's door; she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) having been so much weakened before by the quack medicines and convulsions, and all her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) sufferings in secret. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) would not see my lord on no account, and Champfort persuaded him (<font color='blue'><b>Champfort</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) illness was pretence, to bring him (<font color='blue'><b>Champfort</b></font>) to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) purpose; which was the more readily believed, because nobody was ever let into my lady's bedchamber but myself. All this time she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) never mentioned your name, ma'am; but once, when I was sitting by her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) bedside, as she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was asleep, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) started suddenly, and cried out, ``Oh, my dearest Belinda! are you come back to me?'' -- She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) awakened herself with the start; and raising herself quite up in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) bed, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) pulled back the curtains, and looked all round the room. I'm sure she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) expected to see you; and when she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) found it was a dream, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) gave a heavy sigh, and sank down upon her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) pillow. I then could not forbear to speak, and this time my lady was greatly touched when I mentioned your name: -- she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) shed tears, ma'am; and you know it is not a little thing that can draw tears from my lady. But when I said something about sending for you, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) answered, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was sure you would not return to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), and that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) would never condescend to ask a favour in vain, even from you. Then I replied that I was sure you loved her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) still, and as well as ever: and that the proof of that was, that Mrs Luttridge and Mrs Freke together, by all their wiles, could not draw you over to their party at Harrowgate, and that you had affronted Mrs Freke by defending her (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>) ladyship. My lady was all surprise at this, and eagerly asked how I came to know it. Now, ma'am, I had it all by a post letter from Mrs Luttridge's maid, who is my cousin, and knows every thing that's going on. My lady from this moment forward could scarce rest an instant without wishing for you, and fretting for you as I knew by her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) manner. One day my lord met me on the stairs as I was coming down from my poor lady's room, and he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) asked me how she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was, and why she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) did not send for a physician. ``The best physician, my lord, she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) could send for,'' said I, <div class="bookquote">``would be Miss Portman; for she (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>)'ll never be well till that good young lady comes back again, in my humble opinion.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>'<div class="bookquote">``And what should prevent that good young lady from coming back again? Not I, surely,''  (<font color='red'><b>lord</b></font>)</div>rejoined my lord, <div class="bookquote">``for I wish she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) were here with all my heart.''

 (<font color='red'><b>lord</b></font>)</div><p/>'<div class="bookquote">``It is not easy to suppose, my lord,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, <div class="bookquote">``after all that has passed, that the young lady would choose to return, or that my lady would ask her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), whilst Mr Champfort remains paramount in the house.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``If that's all,''  (<font color='red'><b>lord</b></font>)</div>cried my lord, <div class="bookquote">``tell your lady I'll part with Champfort upon the spot; for the rascal has just had the insolence to insist upon it, that a pair of new boots are not too tight for me, when I said they were. I'll show him (<font color='blue'><b>rascal</b></font>) I can be master, and will, in my own house.''  (<font color='red'><b>lord</b></font>)</div>Ma'am, my heart leaped for joy within me at hearing these words, and I ran up to my lady with them. I easily concluded in my own mind, that my lord was glad of the pretence of the boots, to give up handsomely after his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) standing out so long. To be sure, my lord's mightily jealous of being master, and mighty fond of his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) own way; but I forgive him (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) every thing for doing as I would have him (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) at last, and dismissing that prince of mischief-makers, Mr Champfort. My lady called for her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) writing-desk directly, and sat up in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) bed, and with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) trembling hand, as you see by the writing, ma'am, wrote a letter to you as fast as ever she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) could, and the postchaise was ordered. I don't know what fancy seized her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) -- but if you remember, ma'am, the hammer-cloth to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) new carriage had orange and black fringe at first: she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) would not use it, till this had been changed to blue and white. Well, ma'am, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) recollected this on a sudden, as I was getting ready to come for you; and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) set the servants at work directly to take off the blue and white, and put on the black and orange fringe again, which she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said must be done before your coming. And my lady ordered her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) own footman to ride along with me; and I have come post, and have travelled night and day, and will never rest till I get back. But, ma'am, I won't keep you any longer from reading your letter, only to say, that I hope to Heaven you will not refuse to return to my poor lady, if it be only to put her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) mind at ease before she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) dies. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) cannot have long to live.''

<p/>As Marriott finished these words they reached the house, and Belinda went to her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) own room to read Lady Delacour's letter. It contained none of her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) customary `eloquence du billet,'' no sprightly wit, no real, no affected gaiety; her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) mind seemed to be exhausted by bodily suffering, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) high spirit subdued. She (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) expressed the most poignant anguish for having indulged such unjust suspicions and intemperate passions. She (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) lamented having forfeited the esteem and affection of the only real friend she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) had ever possessed -- a friend of whose forbearance, tenderness, and fidelity, she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) had received such indisputable proofs. She (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) concluded by saying, <div class="bookquote">``I feel my end fast approaching, and perhaps, Belinda, your humanity will induce you to grant my last request, and to let me see you once more before I die.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div><p/>Belinda immediately decided to return to Lady Delacour -- though it was with real regret that she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) thought of leaving Lady Anne Percival, and the amiable and happy family to whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) had become so much attached. The children crowded round her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) when they heard that she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) was going, and Mr Vincent stood in silent sorrow -- but we spare our readers this parting scene. Miss Portman promised to return to Oakly-park as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) possibly could. Mr Vincent anxiously requested permission to follow her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) to town: but this she (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) positively refused; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) submitted with as good a grace as a lover can submit to any thing that crosses his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) passion.

<p/>CHAPTER XX

<p/>Reconciliation

<p/>AWARE that her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) remaining in town at such an unusual season of the year would appear unaccountable to her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) fashionable acquaintance, Lady Delacour contrived for herself a characteristic excuse; she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) declared that there was no possibility of finding pleasure in any thing but novelty, and that the greatest novelty to her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) would be to remain a whole summer in town. Most of her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) friends, amongst whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) had successfully established a character for caprice, were satisfied that this was merely some new whim, practised to signalize herself by singularity. The real reason that detained her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) was her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) dependence upon the empiric, who had repeatedly visited and constantly prescribed for her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>). Convinced, however, by the dreadful situation to which his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) prescriptions had lately reduced her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>), that he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) was unworthy of her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) confidence, she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) determined to dismiss him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>): but she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) could not do this, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) had a considerable sum to pay him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>), until Marriott's return, because she (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) could not trust any one but Marriott to let him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) up the private staircase into the boudoir.

<p/>During Marriott's absence, her (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) ladyship suffered no one to attend her (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) but a maid who was remarkable for her (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) stupidity. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) thought that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) could have nothing to fear from this girl's spirit of inquiry, for never was any human being so destitute of curiosity. It was about noon when Belinda and Marriott arrived. Lady Delacour, who had passed a restless night, was asleep. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) awoke, she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) found Marriott standing beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) bed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then it is all in vain, I see,''  (<font color='red'><b>ladyship</b></font>)</div>cried her (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) ladyship: <div class="bookquote">``Miss Portman is not with you? -- Give me my laudanum.''

 (<font color='red'><b>ladyship</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Portman is come, my lady,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marriott/Mrs Marriott</b></font>)</div>said Marriott; `she (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) is in the dressing-room: she (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) would not come in here with me, lest she (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) should startle you.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Belinda is come, do you say? Admirable Belinda!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>cried Lady Delacour, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) clasped her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) hands with ecstasy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Shall I tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>), my lady, that you are awake?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes -- no -- stay -- Lord Delacour is at home. I will get up immediately. Let my lord be told that I wish to speak with him (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) -- that I beg he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) will breakfast with me in my dressing-room half an hour hence. I will dress immediately.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Marriott/Mrs Marriott</b></font>)</div><p/>Marriott in vain represented that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) ought not to hurry herself in her (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) present weak state. Intent upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) own thoughts, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) listened to nothing that was said, but frequently urged Marriott to be expeditious. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) put on an unusual quantity of rouge: then looking at herself in the glass, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) said, with a forced smile, <div class="bookquote">``Marriott, I look so charmingly, that Miss Portman, perhaps, will be of Lord Delacour's opinion, and think that nothing is the matter with me. Ah! no; she (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) has been behind the scenes -- she (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) knows the truth too well! -- Marriott, pray did she (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) ask you many questions about me? -- Was not she (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) very sorry to leave Oakly-park? -- Were not they all extremely concerned to part with her (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>)? -- Did she (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) ask after Helena? -- Did you tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) that I insisted upon my lord's parting with Champfort?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>At the word Champfort, Marriott's mouth opened eagerly, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) began to answer with her (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) usual volubility. Lady Delacour waited not for any reply to the various questions which, in the hurry of her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) mind, she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) had asked; but, passing swiftly by Marriott, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) threw open the door of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) dressing-room. At the sight of Belinda she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) stopped short; and, totally overpowered, she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) would have sunk upon the floor, had not Miss Portman caught her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) arms, and supported her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) to a sofa. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) came to herself, and heard the soothing tone of Belinda's voice, she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) looked up timidly in her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) face for a few moments without being able to speak.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And are you really here once more, my dear Belinda?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>cried she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) at last; `and may I still call you my friend? -- and do you forgive me? -- Yes, I see you do -- and from you I can endure the humiliation of being forgiven. Enjoy the noble sense of your own superiority.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear Lady Delacour,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Belinda, `you see all this in too strong a light: you have done me no injury -- I have nothing to forgive.''

<p/>``I cannot see it in too strong a light. -- Nothing to forgive! -- Yes, you have; that which it is the most difficult to forgive -- injustice. Oh, how you must have despised me for the folly, the meanness of my suspicions! Of all tempers that which appears to me, and I am sure to you, the most despicable, the most intolerable, is a suspicious temper. Mine was once open, generous as your own -- you see how the best dispositions may be depraved -- what am I now? Fit only

<p/><div class="bookquote">``To point a moral, or adorn a tale''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--
a mismatched, misplaced, miserable, perverted being.''
``And now you have abused yourself till you are breathless, I may have some chance,'' said Belinda, `of being heard in your defence. I perfectly agree with you in thinking that a suspicious temper is despicable and intolerable; but there is a vast difference between an acute fit of jealousy, as our friend Dr X-- would say, and a chronic habit of suspicion. The noblest natures may be worked up to suspicion by designing villany; and then a handkerchief, or a hammercloth, <div class="bookquote">``trifles as light as air''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>-- '

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, my dear, you are too good. But my folly admits of no excuse, no palliation,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>interrupted Lady Delacour; `mine was jealousy without love.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That indeed would admit of no excuse,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Belinda; `therefore you will pardon me if I think it incredible -- especially as I have detected you in feeling something like affection for your little daughter, after you had done your best, I mean your worst, to make me believe that you were a monster of a mother.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That was quite another affair, my dear. I did not know Helena was worth loving. I did not imagine my little daughter could love me. When I found my mistake, I changed my tone. But there is no hope of mistake with my poor husband. Your own sense must show you, that Lord Delacour is not a man to be loved.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That could not always have been your ladyship's opinion,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Belinda, with an arch smile.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Lord! my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>said Lady Delacour, a little embarrassed, `in the highest paroxysm of my madness, I never suspected that you could love Lord Delacour; I surely only hinted that you were in love with his (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) coronet. That was absurd enough in all conscience -- don't make me more absurd than I am.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it then the height of absurdity to love a husband?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Love! Nonsense! -- Impossible! -- Hush! here he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) comes, with his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) odious creaking shoes. What man can ever expect to be loved who wears creaking shoes?''  (<font color='red'><b>ladyship</b></font>)</div>pursued her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) ladyship, as Lord Delacour entered the room, his (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) shoes creaking at every step; and assuming an air of levity, she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) welcomed him (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) as a stranger to her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) dressing-room.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No speeches, my lord! no speeches, I beseech you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>cried she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>), as he (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) was beginning to speak to Miss Portman. <div class="bookquote">``Believe me, that explanations always make bad worse. Miss Portman is here, thank Heaven! and her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>); and Champfort is gone, thank you -- or your boots. And now let us sit down to breakfast, and forget as soon as possible every thing that is disagreeable.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div><p/>When Lady Delacour had a mind to banish painful recollections, it was scarcely possible to resist the magical influence of her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) conversation and manners; yet her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) lord's features never relaxed to a smile during this breakfast. He (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) maintained an obstinate silence, and a profound solemnity -- till at last, rising from table, he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) turned to Miss Portman, and said, <div class="bookquote">``Of all the caprices of fine ladies, that which surprises me the most is the whim of keeping their beds without being sick. Now, Miss Portman, you would hardly suppose that my Lady Delacour, who has been so lively this morning, has kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) bed, as I am informed, a fortnight -- is not this astonishing?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Prodigiously astonishing, that my Lord Delacour, like all the rest of the world, should be liable to be deceived by appearances,''  (<font color='red'><b>ladyship</b></font>)</div>cried her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) ladyship. <div class="bookquote">``Honour me with your attention for a few minutes, my lord, and perhaps I may increase your astonishment.''

 (<font color='red'><b>lordship</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) lordship, struck by the sudden change of her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) voice from gaiety to gravity, fixed his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) eyes upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) and returned to his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) seat. She (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) paused -- then addressing herself to Belinda, <div class="bookquote">``My incomparable friend,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``I will now give you a convincing proof of the unlimited power you have over my mind. My lord, Miss Portman has persuaded me to the step which I am now going to take. She (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) has prevailed upon me to make a decisive trial of your prudence and kindness. She (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) has determined me to throw myself on your mercy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mercy!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Delacour</b></font>)</div>repeated Lord Delacour; and a confused idea, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) was now about to make a confession of the justice of some of his (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) former suspicions, took possession of his (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) mind: he (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) looked aghast.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am going, my lord, to confide to you a secret of the utmost importance -- a secret which is known to but three people in the world -- Miss Portman, Marriott, and a man whose name I cannot reveal to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Stop, Lady Delacour!''  (<font color='red'><b>lordship</b></font>)</div>cried his (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) lordship, with a degree of emotion and energy which he (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) had never shown till now: `stop, I conjure, I command you, madam! I am not sufficiently master of myself -- I once loved you too well to bear such a stroke. Trust me with no such secret -- say no more -- you have said enough -- too much. I forgive you, that is all I can do: but we must part, Lady Delacour!'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>), breaking from her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) with agony expressed in his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) countenance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The man has a heart, a soul, I protest! You knew him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) better than I did, Miss Portman. Nay, you are not gone yet, my lord! You really love me, I find.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no, no,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>cried he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>), vehemently: `weak as you take me to be, Lady Delacour, I am incapable of loving a woman who has disgraced me, disgraced herself, her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) family, her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) station, her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) high endowments, her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) -- ' His (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) utterance failed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Lady Delacour!''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>cried Belinda, `how can you trifle in this manner?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I meant not,''  (<font color='red'><b>ladyship</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) ladyship, `to trifle: I am satisfied. My lord, it is time that you should be satisfied. I can give you the most irrefragable proof, that whatever may have been the apparent levity of my conduct, you have had no serious cause for jealousy. But the proof will shock -- disgust you. Have you courage to know more? -- Then follow me.''

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>). -- Belinda heard the boudoir door unlocked. -- In a few minutes they returned -- Grief, and horror, and pity, were painted in Lord Delacour's countenance, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) passed hastily through the room.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dearest friend, I have taken your advice: would to Heaven I had taken it sooner!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>said Lady Delacour to Miss Portman. <div class="bookquote">``I have revealed to Lord Delacour my real situation. Poor man! he (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) was shocked beyond expression. He (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) behaved incomparably well. I am convinced that he (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) would, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) said, let his (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) hand be cut off to save my life. The moment his (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) foolish jealousy was extinguished, his (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) love for me revived in full force. Would you believe it? he (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) has promised me to break with odious Mrs Luttridge. Upon my charging him (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) to keep my secret from her (<font color='blue'><b>Luttridge</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) instantly, in the handsomest manner in the world, declared he (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) would never see her (<font color='blue'><b>Luttridge</b></font>) more, rather than give me a moment's uneasiness. How I reproach myself for having been for years the torment of this man's life!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You may do better than reproach yourself, my dear Lady Delacour,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Belinda; `you may yet live for years to be the blessing and pride of his (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) life. I am persuaded that nothing but your despair of obtaining domestic happiness has so long enslaved you to dissipation; and now that you find a friend in your husband, now that you know the affectionate temper of your little Helena, you will have fresh views and fresh hopes; you will have the courage to live for yourself, and not for what is called the world.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The world!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>cried Lady Delacour, with a tone of disdain: `how long has that word enslaved a soul formed for higher purposes!'' She (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) paused, and looked up towards heaven with an expression of fervent devotion, which Belinda had once, and but once, before seen in her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) countenance. Then, as if forgetful even that Belinda was present, she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) threw herself upon a sofa, and fell, or seemed to fall, into a profound reverie. She (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) was roused by the entrance of Marriott, who came into the room to ask whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) would now take her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) laudanum. ``I thought I had taken it,'' said she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) in a feeble voice; and as she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) raised her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) eyes and saw Belinda, she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) added, with a faint smile, ``Miss Portman, I believe, has been laudanum to me this morning: but even that will not do long, you see; nothing will do for me now but this,'' and she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) stretched out her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) hand for the laudanum. ``Is not it shocking to think,<div class="bookquote">'' continued she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>), after she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) had swallowed it, `that in laudanum alone I find the means of supporting existence?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) put her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) hand to her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) head, as if partly conscious of the confusion of her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) own ideas: and ashamed that Belinda should witness it, she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) desired Marriott to assist her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) to rise, and to support her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) to her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) bedchamber. She (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) made a sign to Miss Portman not to follow her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Do not take it unkindly, but I am quite exhausted, and wish to be alone; for I am grown fond of being alone some hours in the day, and perhaps I shall sleep.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Marriott/Mrs Marriott</b></font>)</div><p/>Marriott came out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) lady's room about a quarter of an hour afterwards, and said that her (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) lady seemed disposed to sleep, but that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) desired to have her (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) book left by her (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) bedside. Marriott searched among several which lay upon the table, for one in which a mark was put. Belinda looked over them along with Marriott, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) was surprised to find that they had almost all methodistical titles. Lady Delacour's mark was in the middle of Wesley's Admonitions. Several pages in other books of the same description Miss Portman found marked in pencil, with reiterated lines, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) knew to be her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) ladyship's customary mode of distinguishing passages that she (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) particularly liked. Some were highly oratorical, but most of them were of a mystical cast, and appeared to Belinda scarcely intelligible. She (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) had reason to be astonished at meeting with such books in the dressing-room of a woman of Lady Delacour's character. During the solitude of her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) illness, her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) ladyship had first begun to think seriously on religious subjects, and the early impressions that had been made on her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) mind in her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) childhood, by a methodistical mother, recurred. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) understanding, weakened perhaps by disease, and never accustomed to reason, was incapable of distinguishing between truth and error; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) temper, naturally enthusiastic, hurried her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) from one extreme to the other -- from thoughtless scepticism to visionary credulity. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) devotion was by no means steady or permanent; it came on by fits usually at the time when the effect of opium was exhausted, or before a fresh dose began to operate. In these intervals she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) was low-spirited -- bitter reflections on the manner in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) had thrown away her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) talents and her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) life obtruded themselves; the idea of the untimely death of Colonel Lawless, of which she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) reproached herself as the cause, returned; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) mind, from being a prey to remorse, began to sink in these desponding moments under the most dreadful superstitious terrors -- terrors the more powerful as they were secret. Whilst the stimulus of laudanum lasted, the train of her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) ideas always changed, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) was amazed at the weak fears and strange notions by which she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) had been disturbed; yet it was not in her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) power entirely to chase away these visions of the night, and they gained gradually a dominion over her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>), of which she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) was heartily ashamed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) resolved to conceal this weakness, as in her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) gayer moments she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) thought it, from Belinda, from whose superior strength of understanding she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) dreaded ridicule or contempt. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) experience of Miss Portman's gentleness and friendship might reasonably have prevented or dispelled such apprehensions; but Lady Delacour was governed by pride, by sentiment, by whim, by enthusiasm, by passion -- by any thing but reason.

<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) began to revive after her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) fit of languor, and had been refreshed by opium and sleep, she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) rang for Marriott, and inquired for Belinda. She (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) was much provoked when Marriott, by way of proving to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) that Miss Postman could not have been tired of being left alone, told her (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) had been in the dressing-room rummaging over the books.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What books?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>cried Lady Delacour. <div class="bookquote">``I forgot that they were left there. Miss Portman is not reading them still, I suppose? Go for them, and let them be locked up in my own bookcase, and bring me the key.''

 (<font color='red'><b>ladyship</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) ladyship appeared in good spirits when she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) saw Belinda again. She (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) rallied her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) upon the serious studies she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) had chosen for her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) morning's amusements. <div class="bookquote">``Those methodistical books, with their strange quaint titles,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>), `are, however, diverting enough to those who, like myself, can find diversion in the height of human absurdity.''

<p/>Deceived by the levity of her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) manner, Belinda concluded that the marks of approbation in these books were ironical, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) thought no more of the matter; for Lady Delacour suddenly gave a new turn to the conversation by exclaiming, <div class="bookquote">``Now we talk of the height of human absurdity, what are we to think of Clarence Hervey?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why should we think of him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) at all?''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Belinda.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``For two excellent reasons, my dear: because we cannot help it, and because he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) deserves it. Yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) deserves it, believe me, if it were only for having written these charming letters,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>said Lady Delacour, opening a cabinet, and talking out a small packet of letters, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) put into Belinda's hands. <div class="bookquote">``Pray, read them; you will find them amazingly edifying, as well as entertaining. I protest I am only puzzled to know whether I shall bind them up with Sterne's Sentimental Journey or Fordyce's Sermons for Young Women. Here, my love, if you like description,''  (<font color='red'><b>ladyship</b></font>)</div>continued her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) ladyship, opening one of the letters, `here is a Radcliffean tour along the picturesque coasts of Dorset and Devonshire. Why he (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) went this tour, unless for the pleasure and glory of describing it, Heaven knows! Clouds and darkness rest over the tourist's private history: but this, of course, renders his (<font color='blue'><b>tourist</b></font>) letters more piquant and interesting. All who have a just taste either for literature or for gallantry, know how much we are indebted to the obscure for the sublime; and orators and lovers feel what felicity there is in the use of the fine figure of suspension.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very good description, indeed!''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Belinda, without raising her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) eyes from the letter, or seeming to pay any attention to the latter part of Lady Delacour's speech; `very good description, certainly!''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, my dear; but here is something better than pure description -- here is sense for you; and pray mark the politeness of addressing sense to a woman -- to a woman of sense, I mean -- and which of us is not? Then here is sentiment for you,''  (<font color='red'><b>ladyship</b></font>)</div>continued her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) ladyship, spreading another letter before Belinda; 'a story of a Dorsetshire lady, who had the misfortune to be married to a man as unlike Mr Percival, and as like Lord Delacour, as possible; and yet, oh, wonderful! they make as happy a couple as one's heart could wish. Now, I am truly candid and good-natured to admire this letter; for every word of it is a lesson to me, and evidently was so intended. But I take it all in good part, because, to do Clarence justice, he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) describes the joys of domestic Paradise in such elegant language, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) does not make me sick. In short, my dear Belinda, to finish my panegyric, as it has been said of some other epistles, if ever there were letters calculated to make you fall in love with the writer of them, these are they.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Miss Portman, folding up the letter which she (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) was just going to read, <div class="bookquote">``I will not run the hazard of reading them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>said Lady Delacour, with a look of mingled concern, reproach, and raillery, `have you actually given up my poor Clarence, merely on account of this mistress in the wood, this Virginia St Pierre? Nonsense! Begging your pardon, my dear, the man loves you. Some entanglement, some punctilio, some doubt, some delicacy, some folly, prevents him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) from being just at this moment, where, I confess, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ought to be -- at your feet; and you, out of patience, which a young lady ought never to be if she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) can help it, will go and marry -- I know you will -- some stick of a rival, purely to provoke him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If ever I marry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Belinda, with a look of proud humility, <div class="bookquote">``I shall certainly marry to please myself, and not to provoke any body else; and, at all events, I hope I shall never marry a stick.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pardon me that word,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>said Lady Delacour. ``I am convinced you never will -- but one is apt to judge of others by one's self. I am willing to believe that Mr Vincent -- '

<p/>``Mr Vincent! How did you know -- ' exclaimed Belinda.

<p/>``How did I know? Why, my dear, do you think I am so little interested about you, that I have not found out some of your secrets? And do you think that Marriott could refrain from telling me, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) most triumphant tone, that ``Miss Portman has not gone to Oakly-park for nothing; that she (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) has made a conquest of a Mr Vincent, a West Indian, a ward, or lately a ward, of Mr Percival's, the handsomest man that ever was seen, and the richest, &c. &c. &c.?<div class="bookquote">'' Now simple I rejoiced at the news; for I took it for granted you would never seriously think of marrying the man.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then why did your ladyship rejoice?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why? Oh, you novice at Cupid's chess-board! do not you see the next move? Check with your new knight, and the game is your own. Now, if your aunt Stanhope saw your look at this instant, she (<font color='blue'><b>Stanhope</b></font>) would give you up for ever -- if she (<font color='blue'><b>Stanhope</b></font>) have not done that already. In plain, unmetaphorical prose, then, cannot you comprehend, my straight-forward Belinda, that if you make Clarence Hervey heartily jealous, let the impediments to your union be what they may, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) will acknowledge himself to be heartily in love with you? I should make no scruple of frightening him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) within an inch of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) life, for his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) good.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And do you imagine that I could use Mr Vincent so ill? -- And can you think me capable of such double dealing?''

But you take the matter so seriously, and you redden with such virtuous indignation, that I dare not say a word more -- only -- may I ask -- are you absolutely engaged to Mr Vincent?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No. We have had the prudence to avoid all promises, all engagements.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There's my good girl!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>cried Lady Delacour, kissing her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>): `all may yet turn out well. Read those letters -- take them to your room, read them, read them; and depend upon it, my dearest Belinda! you are not the sort of woman that will, that can be happy, if you make a mere match of convenience. Forgive me -- I love you too well not to speak the truth, though it may offend for a moment.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You do not offend, but you misunderstand me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Belinda. <div class="bookquote">``Have patience with me, and you shall find that I am incapable of making a mere match of convenience.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div><p/>Then Miss Portman gave Lady Delacour a simple but full account of all that had passed at Oakly-park relative to Mr Vincent. She (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) repeated the arguments by which Lady Anne Percival had first prevailed upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) to admit of Mr Vincent's addresses. She (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) said, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) had been convinced by Mr Percival, that the omnipotence of a first love was an idea founded in error, and realized only in romance; and that to believe that none could be happy in marriage, except with the first object of their fancy or their affections, would be an error pernicious to individuals and to society. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) detailed the arguments used by Mr Percival on this subject, Lady Delacour sighed, and observed that Mr Percival was certainly right, judging from his (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) own experience, to declaim against the folly of first loves; `and for the same reason,<div class="bookquote">'' added she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>), `perhaps I may be pardoned if I retain some prejudice in their favour.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr Percival</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) turned aside her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) head to hide a starting tear, and here the conversation dropped. Belinda, recollecting the circumstances of her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) ladyship's early history, reproached herself for having touched on this tender subject, yet at the same time she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) felt with increased force, at this moment, the justice of Mr Percival's observations; for, evidently, the hold which this prejudice had kept in Lady Delacour's mind had materially injured her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) happiness, by making her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) neglect, after her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) marriage, all the means of content that were in her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) reach. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) incessant comparisons between her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) first love and her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) husband excited perpetual contempt and disgust in her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) mind for her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) wedded lord, and for many years precluded all perception of his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) good qualities, all desire to live with him (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) upon good terms, and all idea of securing that share of domestic happiness that was actually in her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) power. Belinda resolved at some future moment, whenever she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) could, with propriety and with effect, to suggest these reflections to Lady Delacour, and in the mean time she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) was determined to turn them to her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) own advantage. She (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) perceived that she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) should have need of all her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) steadiness to preserve her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) judgment unbiassed by her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) ladyship's wit and persuasive eloquence on the one hand, and on the other by her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) own high opinion of Lady Anne Percival's judgment, and the anxious desire she (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) felt to secure her (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) approbation. The letters from Clarence Hervey she (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) read at night, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) retired to her (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) own room; and they certainly raised not only Belinda's opinion of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) talents, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) esteem for his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) character. She (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) saw that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) had, with great address, made use of the influence he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) possessed over Lady Delacour, to turn her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) mind to every thing that could make her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) amiable, estimable, and happy -- she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) saw that Clarence, so far from attempting, for the sake of his (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) own vanity, to retain his (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) pre-eminence in her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) ladyship's imagination, used on the contrary `his (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) utmost skill' to turn the tide of her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) affections toward her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) husband and her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) daughter. In one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) letters, and but in one, he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) mentioned Belinda. He (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) expressed great regret in hearing from Lady Delacour that her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) friend, Miss Portman, was no longer with her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) expatiated on the inestimable advantages and happiness of having such a friend -- but this referred to Lady Delacour, not to himself. There was an air of much respect and some embarrassment in all he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) said of Belinda, but nothing like love. A few words at the end of this paragraph were cautiously obliterated, however; and, without any obvious link of connexion, the writer began a new sentence with a general reflection upon the folly and imprudence of forming romantic projects. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) enumerated some of the various schemes he (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) had formed in his (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) early youth, and humorously recounted how they had failed, or how they had been abandoned. Afterward, changing his (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) tone from playful wit to serious philosophy, he (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) observed the changes which these experiments had made to his (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) own character.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My friend, Dr X--,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>), `divides mankind into three classes: those who learn from the experience of others -- they are happy men; those who learn from their own experience -- they are wise men; and, lastly, those who learn neither from their own nor from other people's experience -- they are fools. This class is by far the largest. I am content,'' continued Clarence, `to be in the middle class -- perhaps you will say because I cannot be in the first: however, were it in my power to choose my own character, I should, forgive me the seeming vanity of the speech, still be content to remain in my present station upon this principle -- the characters of those who are taught by their own experience must be progressive in knowledge and virtue. Those who learn from the experience of others may become stationary, because they must depend for their progress on the experiments that we brave volunteers, at whose expense they are to live and learn, are pleased to try. There may be much safety in thus snugly fighting, or rather seeing the battle of life, behind the broad shield of a stouter warrior; yet it seems to me to be rather an ignominious than an enviable situation.

<p/>``Our friend, Dr X--, would laugh at my insisting upon being amongst the class of learners by their own experience. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) would ask me, whether it be the ultimate end of my philosophy to try experiments, or to be happy. And what answer should I make? I have none ready. Common sense stares me in the face, and my feelings, even at this instant, alas! confuse my system. I shall pay too dear yet for some of my experiments. <div class="bookquote">``Sois grand homme, et sois malheureux,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>is, I am afraid, the law of nature, or rather the decree of the world. Your ladyship will not read this without a smile; for you will immediately infer, that I think myself a great man; and as I detest hypocrisy yet more than vanity, I shall not deny the charge. At all events, I feel that I am at present -- however gaily I talk of it -- in as fair a way to be unhappy for life, as if I were, in good earnest, the greatest man in Europe.

<p/>``Your ladyship's
most respectful admirer,

CLARENCE HERVEY.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``P.S. -- Is there any hope that your friend, Miss Portman, may spend the winter in town?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div><p/>Though Lady Delacour had been much fatigued by the exertion of her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) spirits during the day, she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) sat up at night to write to Mr Hervey. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) love and gratitude to Miss Portman interested her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) most warmly for her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) happiness, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) was persuaded that the most effectual way to secure it would be to promote her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) union with her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) first love. Lady Delacour, who had also the best opinion of Clarence Hervey, and the most sincere friendship for him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>), thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) was likewise acting highly for his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) interest; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) had some merit in at once parting with him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) from the train of her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) admirers, and urging him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) to become a dull, married man. Besides these generous motives, she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) was, perhaps, a little influenced by jealousy of the superior power which Lady Anne Percival had in so short a time acquired over Belinda's mind. <div class="bookquote">``Strange,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>), `if love and I be not a match for Lady Anne Percival and reason!'' To do Lady Delacour justice, it must be observed, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) took the utmost care in her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) letter not to commit her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) friend; she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) wrote with all the delicate address of which she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) was mistress. She (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) began by rallying her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) correspondent on his (<font color='blue'><b>correspondent</b></font>) indulging himself so charmingly in the melancholy of genius; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) prescribed as a cure to her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) malheureux imaginaire, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) called him (<font color='blue'><b>correspondent</b></font>), those joys of domestic life which he (<font color='blue'><b>correspondent</b></font>) so well knew how to paint.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Précepte commence, exemple achève,''  (<font color='red'><b>ladyship</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) ladyship. ``You will never see me la femme comme il y en a peu, till I see you le bon mari. Belinda Portman has this day returned to me from Oakly-park, fresh, blooming, wise, and gay, as country air, flattery, philosophy, and love can make her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>). It seems that she (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) has had full employment for her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) head and heart. Mr Percival and Lady Anne, by right of science and reason, have taken possession of the head, and a Mr Vincent, their ci-devant ward and declared favourite, has laid close siege to the heart, of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) is in a fair way, I think, to take possession, by the right of conquest. As far as I can understand -- for I have not yet seen le futur -- he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) deserves my Belinda; for besides being as handsome as any hero of romance, ancient or modern, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) has a soul to which neither spot nor blemish can be found, except the amiable weakness of being desperately in love -- a weakness which we ladies are apt to prefer to the most philosophic stoicism; apropos of philosophy -- we may presume, that notwithstanding Mr V-- is a creole, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr</b></font>) has been bred up by his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr</b></font>) guardian in the class of men who learn by the experience of others. As such, according to your system, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr</b></font>) has a right to expect to be a happy man, has not he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr</b></font>)? According to Mrs Stanhope's system, I am sure that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr</b></font>) has: for his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr</b></font>) thousands and tens of thousands, as I am credibly informed, pass the comprehension of the numeration table.

<p/>``But these will weigh not a grain in the estimation of her (<font color='blue'><b>Stanhope</b></font>) truly disinterested and noble-minded niece. Mrs Stanhope knows nothing of Mr Vincent's proposals; and it is well for him (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Stanhope</b></font>) does not, for her (<font color='blue'><b>Stanhope</b></font>) worldly good word would mar the whole. Not so as to Lady Anne and Mr Percival's approbation -- their opinion is all in all with my friend. How they have contrived it, I know not, but they have gained over Belinda's mind a degree of power almost equal to parental authority; so you may guess that the doubtful beam will not much longer nod from side to side: indeed it seems to me scarcely necessary to throw in the sword of authority to turn the scale.

<p/>``If you can persuade yourself to finish your picturesque tour before the ides of the charming month of November, do, my dear Clarence! make haste and come back to us in time for Belinda's wedding -- and do not forget my commission about the Dorsetshire angel; bring me one in your right hand with a gold ring upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) taper finger -- so help you, Cupid! or never more expect a smile

<p/>``From your sincere friend
and admirer,
T.C.H. DELACOUR.

<p/>``P.S. Observe, my good sir, that I am not in such a desperate hurry to congratulate you on your marriage, that I should be satisfied with an ordinary Mrs Hervey: so do not, under pretence of obliging me, or for any other consideration, yoke yourself to some damsel that you will be ashamed to produce. For one woman worthy to be Clarence Hervey's wife, I have seen, at a moderate computation, a hundred fit to be his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) mistress. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) should, on this subject, mistake the fitness of things or of persons, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) would indeed be in a fair way to be unhappy for life.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The substance of a lady's letter, it has been said, always is comprised in the postscript.''


 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div><p/>After Lady Delacour had finished this letter, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) had no doubt would bring Clarence immediately to town, she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) left it with Marriott, with orders to have it sent by the next post. Much fatigued, she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) then retired to rest, and was not visible the next day till near dinner-time. When Miss Portman returned the packet of Mr Hervey's letters, her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) ladyship was dissatisfied with the measured terms of Belinda's approbation, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) said, with a sarcastic smile,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So, they have made a complete philosopher of you at Oakly-park! You are perfect in the first lesson -- not to admire. And is the torch of Cupid to be extinguished on the altar of Reason?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Rather to be lighted there, if possible,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Belinda; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) endeavoured to turn the conversation to what she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) thought must be more immediately interesting to Lady Delacour -- her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) own health. She (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) assured her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>), with perfect truth, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) was at present more intent upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) situation than upon Cupid or his (<font color='blue'><b>Cupid</b></font>) torch.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I believe you, my generous Belinda!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>said Lady Delacour; `and for that very reason I am interested in your affairs, I am afraid, even to the verge of impertinence. May I ask why this preux chevalier of yours did not attend you, or follow you to town?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr Vincent? -- He (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) knew that I came to attend your ladyship. I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) that you had been confined by a nervous fever, and that it would be impossible for me to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) at present; but I promised, when you could spare me, to return to Oakly-park.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div><p/>Lady Delacour sighed, and opened Clarence Hervey's letters one after another, looking over them without seeming well to know what she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) was about. Lord Delacour came into the room whilst these letters were still in her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) hand. He (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) had been absent since the preceding morning, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) now seemed as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) were just come home, much fatigued. He (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) began in a tone of great anxiety to inquire after Lady Delacour's health. She (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) was piqued at his (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) having left home at such a time, and, merely bowing her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) head to him (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) went on reading. His (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) eyes glanced upon the letters which she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) held in her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) hand; and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) saw the well-known writing of Clarence Hervey, his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) manner immediately altered, and, stammering out some common-place phrases, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) threw himself into an arm-chair by the fireside, protesting that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) was tired to death -- that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) was half dead -- that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) had been in a post-chaise for three hours, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) hated -- had ridden fifty miles since yesterday; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) muttered that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) was a fool for his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) pains -- an observation which, though it reached her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) ladyship's ears, she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) did not think proper to contradict.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) lordship had then recourse to his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) watch, his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) never-failing friend in need, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) always pulled out with a particular jerk when he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) was vexed.

<p/>``It is time for me to be gone -- I shall be late at Studley<div class="bookquote">``s.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You dine with his (<font color='blue'><b>Studley</b></font>) lordship then?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>said Lady Delacour, in a careless tone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; and his (<font color='blue'><b>Studley</b></font>) good burgundy, I hope, will wind me up again,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>), stretching himself, `for I am quite down.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Quite down? Then we may conclude that my friend Mrs Luttridge is not yet come to Rantipole. Rantipole, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>continued Lady Delacour, turning to Miss Portman, `is the name of Harriot Freke's villa in Kent. However strange it may sound to your ears and mine, I can assure you the name has made fortunes amongst a certain description of wits. And candour must allow that, if not elegant, it is appropriate; it gives a just idea of the manners and way of life of the place, for every thing at Rantipole is rantipole. But I am really concerned, my lord, you should have ridden yourself down in this way for nothing. Why did not you get better intelligence before you set out? I am afraid you feel the loss of Champfort. Why did not you contrive to learn for certain, my dear good lord, whether the Luttridge was at Rantipole, before you set out on this wild goose chase?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear good lady,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Delacour</b></font>)</div>replied Lord Delacour, assuming a degree of spirit which startled her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) as much as it became him (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>), `why do you not get better intelligence before you suspect me of being a brute and a liar? Did not I promise you yesterday, that I would break with the Luttridge, as you call her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>)? and how could you imagine that the instant afterwards, just at the time I was wrung to the soul, as you know I was -- how could you imagine I would leave you to go to Rantipole, or to any woman upon earth?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, my lord! I beg your pardon, I beg your pardon a thousand times,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>cried Lady Delacour, rising with much emotion; and, going towards him (<font color='blue'><b>liar</b></font>) with a sudden impulse, she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) kissed his (<font color='blue'><b>liar</b></font>) forehead.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And so you ought to beg my pardon,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Delacour</b></font>)</div>said Lord Delacour, in a faltering voice, but without moving his (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) posture.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You will acknowledge you left me, however, my lord? That is clear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Left you! Yes, so I did; to ride all over the country in search of a house that would suit you. For what else did you think I could leave you at such a time as this?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div><p/>Lady Delacour again stooped, and leaned her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) arm upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) shoulder.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish to Heaven, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>lordship</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) lordship, shrinking as he (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) put away her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) hand, which still held Clarence Hervey's letters, <div class="bookquote">``I wish to Heaven, my dear, you would not hold those abominable perfumed papers just under my very nose.

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Whilst his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) lordship applied himself to trimming the lamp with great earnestness, Lady Delacour negligently walked away to the farthest end of the room, where stood the cabinet, which Belinda was trying to unlock.

Fools have seldom so much penetration, or so much delicacy.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But, Lord! What would you have me do? what would you have me say? That Lord Delacour writes better letters than these?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, no! but show him (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) these letters, and you will do justice to him (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>), to yourself, to Cla -- , to every body.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sure I should be happy to do justice to every body.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then pray do this very instant, my dearest Lady Delacour! And I shall love you for it all my life.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Done! -- for who can withstand that offer? -- Done!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If the lock be spoiled, Lady Delacour, you had better send for a locksmith,''  (<font color='red'><b>lordship</b></font>)</div>replied his (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) lordship, who was still employed about the wick of the Argand: <div class="bookquote">``I am no locksmith -- I do not pretend to understand locks -- especially secret locks.''

 (<font color='red'><b>lordship</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you will not desert us at our utmost need, I am sure, my lord,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Belinda, approaching him (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) with a conciliatory smile.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You want the light, I believe, more than I do,''  (<font color='red'><b>lordship</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) lordship, advancing with the lamp to meet her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Well! what is the matter with this confounded lock of yours, Lady Delacour? I know I should be at Studley's by this time -- but how in the devil's name can you expect me to open a secret lock when I do not know the secret, Lady Delacour?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then I will tell you the secret, Lord Delacour -- that there is no secret at all in the lock, or in the letters. Here, if you can stand the odious smell of ottar of roses, take these letters and read them, foolish man; and keep them till the shocking perfume is gone off.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lord Delacour</b></font>)</div><p/>Lord Delacour could scarcely believe his (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) senses; he (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) looked in Lady Delacour's eyes to see whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) had understood her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) rightly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But I am afraid,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>), smiling, `that you will find the perfume too overcoming.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not half so overcoming,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) cried, seizing her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) hand, and kissing it often with eager tenderness, `not half so overcoming as this confidence, this kindness, this condescension from you.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Portman will think us both a couple of old fools,''  (<font color='red'><b>ladyship</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) ladyship, making a slight effort to withdraw her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) hand. <div class="bookquote">``But she (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) is almost as great a simpleton herself, I think,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>continued she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>), observing that the tears stood in Belinda's eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My lord,''  (<font color='red'><b>a footman</b></font>)</div>said a footman who came in at this instant, `do you dress? The carriage is at the door, as you ordered, to go to Lord Studley<div class="bookquote">``s.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lord Studley/Studley</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'd see Lord Studley at the devil, sir, and his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) burgundy along with him (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>), before I'd go to him (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) to-day; and you may tell him (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) so, if you please,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Studley/Studley</b></font>)</div>cried Lord Delacour.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well, my lord,''  (<font color='red'><b>the footman</b></font>)</div>said the footman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My lord dines at home -- they may put up the carriage -- that's all,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>said Lady Delacour: `only let us have dinner directly,'' added she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>), as the servant shut the door. <div class="bookquote">``Miss Portman will be famished amongst us: there is no living upon sentiment.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And there is no living with such belles without being something more of a beau,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Delacour</b></font>)</div>said Lord Delacour, looking at his (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) splashed boots. <div class="bookquote">``I will be ready for dinner before dinner is ready for me.''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>With activity very unusual to him (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) hurried out of the room to change his (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) dress.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``O day of wonders!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Lady Delacour. ``And, O night of wonders! if we can get him (<font color='blue'><b>beau</b></font>) through the evening without the help of Lord Studley's wine. You must give us some music, my good Belinda, and make him (<font color='blue'><b>Studley</b></font>) accompany you with his (<font color='blue'><b>Studley</b></font>) flute. I can tell you he (<font color='blue'><b>Studley</b></font>) has really a very pretty taste for music, and knows fifty times more of the matter than half the dilettanti, who squeeze the human face divine into all manner of ridiculous shapes, by way of persuading you that they are in ecstasy! And, my dear, do not forget to show us the charming little portfolio of drawings that you have brought from Oakly-park. Lord Delacour was with me at Harrowgate in the days of his (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) courtship: he (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) knows the charming views that you have been taking about Knaresborough and Fountain's Abbey, and all those places. I will answer for it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) remembers them a hundred times better than I do. And, my love, I assure you he (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) is a better judge of drawing than many whom we saw ogling Venus rising from the sea, in the Orleans gallery. Lord Delacour has let his (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) talents go to sleep in a shameless manner; but really he (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) has talents, if they could be wakened. By-the-by, pray make him (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) tell you the story of Lord Studley's original Titian: he (<font color='blue'><b>Titian</b></font>) tells that story with real humour. Perhaps you have not found it out, but Lord Delacour has a vast deal of drollery in his (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) own way, and -- '

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dinner's ready, my lady!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is a pity!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>whispered Lady Delacour; `for if they had let me go on in my present humour, I should have found out that my lord has every accomplishment under the sun, and every requisite under the moon, to make the marriage state happy.''

<p/>With the assistance of Belinda's portfolio and her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) harp, and the good-humour and sprightliness of Lady Delacour's wit, his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) lordship got through the evening much to his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) own satisfaction. He (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) played on the flute, he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) told the story of Studley's original Titian, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Titian</b></font>) detected a fault that had escaped Mr Percival in the perspective of Miss Portman's sketch of Fountain's Abbey. The perception that his (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) talents were called out, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) appeared to unusual advantage, made him (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) excellent company: he (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) found that the spirits can be raised by self-complacency even more agreeably than by burgundy.

<p/>CHAPTER XXI

<p/>Helena

<p/>WHILST they were at breakfast the next morning in Lady Delacour's dressing-room, Marriott knocked at the door, and immediately opening it, exclaimed in a joyful tone, <div class="bookquote">``Miss Portman, they're eating it! Ma'am, they're eating it as fast as ever they can!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Marriott/Mrs Marriott</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Bring them in; your lady will give you leave, Marriott, I fancy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Miss Portman. Marriott brought in her (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) gold fishes; some green leaves were floating on the top of the water in the glass globe.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``See, my lady,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>), `what Miss Portman has been so good as to bring from Oakly-park for my poor gold fishes, who, I am sure, ought to be much obliged to her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>), as well as myself.'' Marriott set the globe beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) lady, and retired.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``From Oakly-park! And by what name impossible to pronounce must I call these green leaves, to please botanic ears?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>said Lady Delacour.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>replied Belinda, `is what

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Th' unlearned, duckweed -- learned, lemna, call;''
 (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>and it is to be found in any ditch or standing pool.''
<div class="bookquote">``And what possessed you, my dear, for the sake of Marriott and her (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) gold fishes, to trouble yourself to bring such stuff a hundred and seventy miles?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To oblige little Charles Percival,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Miss Portman. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) was anxious to keep his (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) promise of sending it to your Helena. She (<font color='blue'><b>Helena</b></font>) found out in some book that she (<font color='blue'><b>Helena</b></font>) was reading with him (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) last summer, that gold fishes are fond of this plant; and I wish,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>added Belinda, in a timid voice, `that she (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) were here at this instant to see them eat it.''

<p/>Lady Delacour was silent for some minutes, and kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) eyes steadily upon the gold fishes. At length she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I never shall forget how well the poor little creatures behaved about those gold fishes. I grew amazingly fond of her (<font color='blue'><b>Helena</b></font>) whilst she (<font color='blue'><b>Helena</b></font>) was with me. But you know, circumstanced as I was, after you left me, I could not have her (<font color='blue'><b>Helena</b></font>) at home.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But now I am here,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Belinda, `will she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) be any trouble to you? And will she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) not make your home more agreeable to you, and to Lord Delacour, who was evidently very fond of her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>)?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, my dear!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>said Lady Delacour, `you forget, and so do I at times, what I have to go through. It is in vain to talk, to think of making home, or any place, or any thing, or any person, agreeable to me now. What am I? The outside rind is left -- the sap is gone. The tree lasts from day to day by miracle -- it cannot last long. You would not wonder to hear me talk in this way, if you knew the terrible time I had last night after we parted. But I have these nights constantly now. Let us talk of something else. What have you there -- a manuscript?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, a little journal of Edward Percival's, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) sent for the entertainment of Helena.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div><p/>Lady Delacour stretched out her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) hand for it. <div class="bookquote">``The boy will write as like his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) father as possible,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>), turning over the leaves. <div class="bookquote">``I wish to have this poor girl with me -- but I have no spirits. And you know, whenever Lord Delacour can find a house that will suit us, we shall leave town, and I could not take Helena with me. But this may be the last opportunity I may ever have of seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Helena</b></font>); and I can refuse you nothing, my dear. So will you go for her (<font color='blue'><b>Helena</b></font>)? She (<font color='blue'><b>Helena</b></font>) can stay with us a few days. Lady Boucher, that most convenient dowager, who likes going about, no matter where, all the morning, will go with you to Mrs. Dumont's academy in Sloane-street. I would as soon go to a bird-fancier's as to a boarding school for young ladies: indeed, I am not well enough to go any where. So I will throw myself upon a sofa, and read this child's journal. I wonder how that or any thing else can interest me now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div><p/>Belinda, who had been used to the variations of Lady Delacour's spirits, was not much alarmed by the despondent strain in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) now spoke, especially when she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) considered that the thoughts of the dreadful trial this unfortunate woman was soon to go through must naturally depress her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) courage. Rejoiced at the permission that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had obtained to go for Helena, Miss Portman sent immediately to Lady Boucher, who took her (<font color='blue'><b>Boucher</b></font>) to Sloane-street.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, my dear, considerate Miss Portman,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Boucher</b></font>)</div>said Lady Boucher, ``I must beg, and request that you will hurry Miss Delacour into the carriage as fast as possible. I have not a moment to spare; for I am to be at a china auction at two, that I would not miss for the whole world. Well, what's the matter with the people? Why does not James knock at the door? Can't the man read? Can't the man see? cried the purblind dowager. <div class="bookquote">``Is not that Mrs Dumont's name on the door before his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, ma'am, I believe this name is Ellicot,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Belinda.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ellicott, is it? Ay, true. But what's the man stopping for, then? Mrs Dumont's is the next door, tell the blind dunce. Mercy on us! To waste one's time in this way! I shall, as sure as fate, be too late for the china auction. What upon earth stops us?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing but a little covered cart, which stands at Mrs Dumont's door. There, now it is going; an old man is drawing it out of the way as fast as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) can.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Open the coach-door, James!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Boucher</b></font>)</div>cried Lady Boucher the moment that they had drawn up. <div class="bookquote">``Now my dear, considerate Miss Portman, remember the auction, and don't let Miss Delacour stay to change her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) dress or any thing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div><p/>Belinda promised not to detain her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) ladyship a minute. The door at Mrs Dumont's was open, and a servant was assisting an old man to carry in some geraniums and balsams out of the covered cart which had stopped the way. In the hall a crowd of children were gathered around a high stand, on which they were eagerly arranging their flower-pots; and the busy hum of voices was so loud, that when Miss Portman first went in, she (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) could neither hear the servant, nor make him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) hear her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) name. Nothing was to be heard but <div class="bookquote">``Oh, how beautiful! Oh, how sweet! That's mine! That's yours! The great rose geranium for Miss Jefferson! The white Provence rose for Miss Adderly! No, indeed, Miss Pococke, that's for Miss Delacour, the old man said so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Silence, silence, mesdemoiselles!''  (<font color='red'><b>a woman</b></font>)</div>cried the voice of a French woman, and all was silence. The little crowd looked towards the hall door; and from the midst of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) companions, Helena Delacour, who now caught a glimpse of Belinda, sprang forward, throwing down her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) white Provence rose as she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) passed.

<p/>``Lady Boucher's compliments, ma``am,<div class="bookquote">'' said the servant to Mrs Dumont; `she (<font color='blue'><b>Dumont</b></font>)'s in indispensable haste, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Dumont</b></font>) begs you won't let Miss Delacour think of changing her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) dress.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Delacour</b></font>)</div><p/>It was the last thing of which Miss Delacour was likely to think at this instant. She (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) was so much overjoyed, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) heard that Belinda was come by her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) mamma's desire to take her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) home, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) would scarcely stay whilst Mrs Dumont was tying on her (<font color='blue'><b>Dumont</b></font>) straw hat, and exhorting her (<font color='blue'><b>Dumont</b></font>) to let Lady Delacour know how it happened that she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) was `so far from fit to be seen.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, ma'am; yes, ma'am, I'll remember; I'll be sure to remember,''  (<font color='red'><b>Helena/Miss Helena</b></font>)</div>said Helena, tripping down the steps. But just as she (<font color='blue'><b>Helena</b></font>) was getting into the carriage she (<font color='blue'><b>Helena</b></font>) stopped at the sight of the old man, and exclaimed, <div class="bookquote">``Oh, good old man! I must not forget you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, indeed you must, though, my dear Miss Delacour,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Boucher</b></font>)</div>said Lady Boucher, pulling her (<font color='blue'><b>Boucher</b></font>) into the carriage: <div class="bookquote">''tis no time to think of good old men now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Boucher</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I must. Dear Miss Portman, will you speak for me! I must pay -- I must settle -- and I have a great deal to say.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Portman desired the old man to call in Berkley-square at Lady Delacour's; and this satisfying all parties, they drove away.

<p/>When they arrived in Berkley-square, Marriott told them that her (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) lady was just gone to lie down. Edward Percival's little journal, which she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had been reading, was left on the sofa, and Belinda gave it to Helena, who eagerly began to look over it. <div class="bookquote">``Thirteen pages! Oh, how good he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has been to write so much for me!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>); and she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) had almost finished reading it before her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) mother came into the room.

<p/>Lady Delacour shrunk back as her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) daughter ran towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>); for she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) recollected too well the agony she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) had once suffered from an embrace of Helena's. The little girl appeared more grieved than surprised at this; and after kissing her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) mother's hand, without speaking, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) again looked down at the manuscript.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Does that engross your attention so entirely, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>said Lady Delacour, `that you can neither spare one word nor one look for your mother?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, mamma! I only tried to read, because I thought you were angry with me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``An odd reason for trying to read, my dear!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>said Lady Delacour with a smile: `have you any better reason for thinking I was angry with you?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, I know you are not angry now, for you smile,''  (<font color='red'><b>Helena/Miss Helena</b></font>)</div>said Helena; `but I thought at first that you were, mamma, because you gave me only your hand to kiss.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Only my hand! The next time, simpleton, I'll give you only my foot to kiss,''  (<font color='red'><b>ladyship</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Helena</b></font>) ladyship, sitting down, and holding out her (<font color='blue'><b>Helena</b></font>) foot playfully.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Helena</b></font>) daughter threw aside the book, and kneeling down kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Helena</b></font>) foot, saying, in a low voice, <div class="bookquote">``Dear mamma, I never was so happy in my life; for you never looked so very, very kindly at me before.''

 (<font color='red'><b>daughter</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do not judge always of the kindness people feel for you, child, by their looks; and remember that it is possible a person might have felt more than you could guess by their looks. Pray now, Helena, you are such a good judge of physiognomy, should you guess that I was dying, by my looks?''

 (<font color='red'><b>The girl</b></font>)</div><p/>The little girl laughed, and repeated <div class="bookquote">``Dying? Oh, no, mamma.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The girl</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh no! because I have such a fine coulor in my cheeks, hey?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not for that reason, mamma,''  (<font color='red'><b>Helena/Miss Helena</b></font>)</div>said Helena, withdrawing her (<font color='blue'><b>Helena</b></font>) eyes from her (<font color='blue'><b>Helena</b></font>) mother's face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What, then you know rouge already when you see it? -- You perceive some difference, for instance, between Miss Portman's colour and mine? Upon my word, you are a nice observer. Such nice observers are sometimes dangerous to have near one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope, mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>Helena/Miss Helena</b></font>)</div>said Helena, `that you do not think I would try to find out any thing that you wish, or that I imagined you wished, I should not know.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not understand you, child,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>cried Lady Delacour, raising herself suddenly upon the sofa, and looking full in her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) daughter's face.

<p/>Helena's colour rose to her (<font color='blue'><b>Helena</b></font>) temples; but, with a firmness that surprised even Belinda, she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) repeated what she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) had said nearly in the same words.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you understand her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), Miss Portman?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>said Lady Delacour.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) expresses, I think,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Belinda, ' a very honorable sentiment, and one that is easily understood.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, in general, certainly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>said Lady Delacour, checking herself; `but I thought that she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) meant to allude to something in particular -- that was what I did not understand. Undoubtedly, my dear, you have just expressed a very honourable sentiment, and one that I should scarcely have expected from a child of your age.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Helena, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) mother, after a silence of some minutes, `did you ever read the Arabian Tales? -- <div class="bookquote">``Yes, mamma,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I know must be the answer. But do you remember the story of Zobeide, who carried the porter home with her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) on condition that, let him (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) hear or see what he (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) might, he (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) would ask no questions?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, mamma.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``On the same conditions should you like to stay with me for a few days?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. On any conditions, mamma, I should like to stay with you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Agreed, then, my dear!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>said Lady Delacour. <div class="bookquote">``Now let us go to the gold fishes, and see them eat lemna, or whatever you please to call it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/>While they were looking at the gold fishes, the old man, who had been desired by Miss Portman to call, arrived. <div class="bookquote">``Who is this fine gray-haired old man?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>said Lady Delacour. Helena, who did not know the share which Belinda's aunt and her (<font color='blue'><b>Helena</b></font>) own mother had in the transaction, began with great eagerness to tell the history of the poor gardener, who had been cheated by some fine ladies out of his (<font color='blue'><b>gardener</b></font>) aloe, &c. She (<font color='blue'><b>Helena</b></font>) then related how kind Lady Anne Percival and her (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) Aunt Margaret had been to him (<font color='blue'><b>gardener</b></font>); that they had gotten him (<font color='blue'><b>gardener</b></font>) a place as a gardener at Twickenham; and that he (<font color='blue'><b>gardener</b></font>) had pleased the family to whom he (<font color='blue'><b>gardener</b></font>) was recommended so much by his (<font color='blue'><b>gardener</b></font>) good behaviour, that, as they were leaving their house, and obliged to part with him (<font color='blue'><b>gardener</b></font>), they had given him (<font color='blue'><b>gardener</b></font>) all the geraniums and balsams out of the green-house of which he (<font color='blue'><b>gardener</b></font>) had the care, and these he (<font color='blue'><b>gardener</b></font>) had been this day selling to the young ladies at Mrs Dumont's. <div class="bookquote">``I received the money for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and I was just going to pay him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Helena/Miss Helena</b></font>)</div>said Helena, `when Miss Portman came; and that put every thing else out of my head. May I go and give him (<font color='blue'><b>gardener</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>gardener</b></font>) money now, mamma?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) can wait a few minutes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>said Lady Delacour, who had listened to this story with much embarrassment and impatience. <div class="bookquote">``Before you go, Helena, favour us with the names of the fine ladies who cheated this old gardener out of his (<font color='blue'><b>gardener</b></font>) aloe.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed, mamma, I don't know their names.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No! -- Did you never ask Lady Anne Percival, or your aunt Margaret? -- Look in my face, child! Did they never inform you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, ma'am, never. I once asked Lady Anne Percival, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) said that she (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) did not choose to tell me; that it would be of no use to me to know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I give Lady Anne Percival more credit and more thanks for this,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>cried Lady Delacour, `than for all the rest. I see she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) has not attempted to lower me in my child's opinion. I am the fine lady, Helena -- I was the cause of his (<font color='blue'><b>gardener</b></font>) being cheated -- I was intent upon the noble end of outshining a certain Mrs Luttridge -- the noble means I left to others, and the means have proved worthy of the end. I deserve to be brought to shame for my folly; yet my being ashamed will do nobody any good but myself. Restitution is in these cases the best proof of repentance. Go, Helena, my love! Settle your little affairs with this old man, and bid him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) call here again to-morrow. I will see what we can do for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).''

<p/>Lord Delacour had this very morning sent home to her (<font color='blue'><b>Helena</b></font>) ladyship a handsome diamond ring, which had been intended as a present for Mrs Luttridge, and which he (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) imagined would therefore be peculiarly acceptable to his (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) lady. In the evening, when his (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) lordship asked her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) how she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) liked the ring, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) desired the jeweler to leave for her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) to look at it, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) answered, that it was a handsome ring, but that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) hoped he (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) had not purchased it for her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is not actually bought, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>lordship</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) lordship; `but if it suits your fancy, I hope you will do me the honour to wear it for my sake.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I will wear it for your sake, my lord,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>said Lady Delacour, `if you desire it; and as a mark of your regard it is agreeable; but as to the rest --

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My taste for diamonds now is o'er,
The sparkling baubles please no more.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>If you wish to do me a kindness, I will tell you what I should like much better than diamonds, though I know it is rather ungracious to dictate the form and fashion of a favour. But as my dictatorship in all human probability cannot last much longer -- '
<div class="bookquote">``Oh, my dear Lady Delacour! I must not hear you talk in this manner; your dictatorship, as you call it, will I hope last many, many happy years. But to the point -- what should you like better, my dear, than this foolish ring?''

 (<font color='red'><b>ladyship</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) ladyship then expressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) wish that a small annuity might be settled upon a poor old man, whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) said she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) had unwittingly injured. She (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) told the story of the rival galas and the aloe, and concluded by observing that her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) lord was in some measure called upon to remedy part of the unnumbered ills which had sprung from her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) hatred of Mrs Luttridge, as he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) had originally been the cause of her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) unextinguishable ire. Lord Delacour was flattered by this hint, and the annuity was immediately promised to the old gardener.

<p/>In talking to this old man afterward, Lady Delacour found, that the family in whose service he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lately lived had a house at Twickenham that would just answer her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) purpose. Lord Delacour's inquiries had hitherto been unsuccessful; he (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) was rejoiced to find what he (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) wanted just as he (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) was giving up the search. The house was taken, and the old man hired as gardener -- a circumstance which seemed to give him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) almost as much pleasure as the annuity; for there was a morello cherry-tree in the garden which had succeeded the aloe in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) affection: `it would have grieved him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sorely,<div class="bookquote">'' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said, `to leave his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) favourite tree to strangers, after all the pains he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had been at in netting it to keep off the birds.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>As the period approached when her (<font color='blue'><b>gardener</b></font>) fate was to be decided, Lady Delacour's courage seemed to rise; and at the same time her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) anxiety, that her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) secret should not be discovered, appeared to increase.

<p/>``If I survive this business, said she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>), `it is my firm intention to appear in a new character, or rather to assert my real character. I will break through the spell of dissipation -- I will at once cast off all the acquaintance that are unworthy of me -- I will, in one word, go with you, my dear Belinda, to Mr Percival's. I can bear to be mortified for my good; and I am willing, since I find that Lady Anne Percival has behaved generously to me, with regard to Helena's affections, I am willing that the recovery of my moral health should be attributed to the salubrious air of Oakly-park. But it would be unexpressible, intolerable mortification to me, to have it said or suspected in the world of fashion, that I retreated from the ranks disabled instead of disgusted. A voluntary retirement is graceful and dignified; a forced retreat is awkward and humiliating. You must be sensible that I could not endure to have it whispered -- ``Lady Delacour now sets up for being a prude, because she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) can no longer be a coquette.'' Lady Delacour would become the subject of witticisms, epigrams, caricatures without end. It would just be the very thing for Mrs Luttridge; then she (<font color='blue'><b>Luttridge</b></font>) would revenge herself without mercy for the ass and her (<font color='blue'><b>Luttridge</b></font>) panniers. We should have ``Lord and Lady D--, or the Domestic Tête-à-Tête,'' or ``The Reformed Amazon,<div class="bookquote">'' stuck up in a print-shop window! Oh, my dear, think of seeing such a thing! I should die with vexation; and of all deaths, that is the death I should like least.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Reformed</b></font>)</div><p/>Though Belinda could not entirely enter into those feelings, which thus made Lady Delacour invent wit against herself, and anticipate caricatures; yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) did every thing in her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) power to calm her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) ladyship's apprehension of a discovery.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>said Lady Delacour, ``I have perfect confidence in Lord Delacour's promise, and in his (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) good-nature, of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) has within these few days given me proofs that are not lost upon my heart; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) is not the most discreet man in the world. Whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) is anxious about any thing, you may read it a mile off in his (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) eyes, nose, mouth, and chin. And to tell you all my fears in one word, Marriott informed me this morning, that the Luttridge, who came from Harrowgate to Rantipole, to meet Lord Delacour, finding that there was no drawing him (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>), has actually brought herself to town.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``To town! -- At this strange time of year! How will my lord resist this unequivocal, unprecedented proof of passion? If she (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) catch hold of him (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) again, I am undone. Or, even suppose him (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) firm as a rock, her (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) surprise, her (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) jealousy, her (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) curiosity, will set all engines at work, to find out by what witchcraft I have taken my husband from her (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>). Every precaution that prudence could devise against her (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) malicious curiosity I have taken. Marriott, you know, is above all temptation. That vile wretch -LRB-naming the person whose quack medicines had nearly destroyed her (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>)-RRB-, that vile wretch will be silent from fear, for his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) own sake. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) is yet to be paid and dismissed. That should have been done long ago, but I had not money both for him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) and Mrs Franks the milliner. She (<font color='blue'><b>Franks</b></font>) is now paid: and Lord Delacour -- I am glad to tell his (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) friend how well he (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) deserves her (<font color='blue'><b>Franks</b></font>) good opinion -- Lord Delacour in the handsomest manner supplied me with the means of satisfying this man. He (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) is to be here at three o'clock to-day; and this is the last interview he (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) will ever have with Lady Delacour in the mysterious boudoir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>ladyship</b></font>)</div><p/>The fears which her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) ladyship expressed of Mrs Luttridge's malicious curiosity were not totally without foundation. Champfort was at work for her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) and for himself. The memorable night of Lady Delacour's overturn, and the bustle that Marriott made about the key of the boudoir, were still fresh in his (<font color='blue'><b>Champfort</b></font>) memory; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Champfort</b></font>) was in hopes that, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Champfort</b></font>) could discover the mystery, he (<font color='blue'><b>Champfort</b></font>) should at once regain his (<font color='blue'><b>Champfort</b></font>) power over Lord Delacour, reinstate himself in his (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) lucrative place, and obtain a handsome reward, or, more properly speaking, bribe, from Mrs Luttridge. The means of obtaining information of all that passed in Lady Delacour's family were, he (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) thought, still in his (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) power, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) was no longer an inmate of the house. The stupid maid was not so stupid as to be impenetrable to the voice of flattery, or, as Mr Champfort called it, the voice of love. He (<font color='blue'><b>Champfort</b></font>) found it his (<font color='blue'><b>Champfort</b></font>) interest to court, and she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) pleasure to be courted. On these `coquettes of the second table,'' on these underplots in the drama, much of the comedy, and some of the tragedy, of life depend. Under the unsuspected mask of stupidity this worthy mistress of our intriguing valet-de-chambre concealed the quick ears of a listener, and the demure eyes of a spy. Long, however, did she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) listen, and long did she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) spy in vain, till at last Mr Champfort gave her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) notice in writing that his (<font color='blue'><b>Champfort</b></font>) love would not last another week, unless she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) could within that time contrive to satisfy his (<font color='blue'><b>Champfort</b></font>) curiosity; and that, in short, she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) must find out the reason why the boudoir was always locked, and why Mrs Marriott alone was to be trusted with the key. Now it happened that this billet-doux was received on the very day appointed for Lady Delacour's last interview with the quack surgeon in the mysterious boudoir. Marriott, as it was her (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) custom upon such occasions, let the surgeon in, and showed him (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) up the back stairs into the boudoir, locked the door, and bade him (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) wait there till her (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) lady came. The man had not been punctual to the hour appointed; and Lady Delacour, giving up all expectation of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) coming till the next day, had retired to her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) bedchamber, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) of late usually at this hour secluded herself to read methodistical books or to sleep. Marriott, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) went up to let her (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) lady know that the person, as she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) always called him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), was come, found her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) so fast asleep that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) thought it a pity to waken her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), as she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had not slept at all the preceding night. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) shut the door very softly, and left her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) lady to repose. At the bottom of the stairs she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was met by the stupid maid, whom she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) immediately despatched with orders to wash some lace: ``Your lady's asleep,<div class="bookquote">'' said she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), `and pray let me have no running up and down stairs.''  (<font color='red'><b>lady</b></font>)</div>The room into which the stupid maid went was directly underneath the boudoir; and whilst she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) was there she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) thought that she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) heard the steps of a man's foot walking over head. She (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) listened more attentively -- she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) heard them again. She (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) armed herself with a glass of jelly in her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) hand, for my lady, and hurried up stairs instantly to my lady's room. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was much surprised to see my lady fast asleep. Her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) astonishment at finding that Mrs Marriott had told her (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) the truth was such, as for a moment to bereave her (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) of all presence of mind, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) stood with the door ajar in her (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) hand. As thus she (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) stood she (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) was roused by the sound of some one clearing his (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) throat very softly in the boudoir -- his (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) throat; for she (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) recollected the footsteps she (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) had heard before, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) was convinced it could be no other than a masculine throat. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) listened again, and stooped down to try whether any feet could be seen under the door. As she (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) was in this attitude, her (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) lady suddenly turned on her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) bed, and the book which she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had been reading fell from the pillow to the floor with a noise, that made the listener start up instantaneously in great terror. The noise, however, did not waken Lady Delacour, who was in that dead sleep which is sometimes the effect of opium. The noise was louder than what could have been made by the fall of a book alone, and the girl descried a key that had fallen along with the book. It occurred to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) that this might possibly be the key of the boudoir. From one of those irresistible impulses which some people make an excuse for doing whatever they please, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) seized it, resolved at all hazards to open the mysterious door. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was cautiously putting the key into the key-hole, so as not to make the least noise, when she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was suddenly startled by a voice behind her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), which said, <div class="bookquote">``Who gave you leave to open that door?''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) turned, and saw Helena standing at the half open bedchamber door.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mercy, Miss Delacour who thought of seeing you! For God's sake, don't make a noise to waken my lady!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did my mother desire you to go into that room?''  (<font color='red'><b>Helena/Miss Helena</b></font>)</div>repeated Helena.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear me! no, miss,''  (<font color='red'><b>the maid</b></font>)</div>said the maid, putting on her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) stupid face; `but I only thought to open the door, to let in a little air to freshen the room, which my lady always likes, and bids me to do -- and I thought -- '

<p/>Helena took the key gently from her (<font color='blue'><b>Helena</b></font>) hand without listening to any more of her (<font color='blue'><b>Helena</b></font>) thoughts, and the woman left the room muttering something about jelly and my lady. Helena went to the side of her (<font color='blue'><b>Helena</b></font>) mother's bed, determined to wait there till she (<font color='blue'><b>Helena</b></font>) awakened, then to give her (<font color='blue'><b>Helena</b></font>) the key, and tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Helena</b></font>) the circumstance. Notwithstanding the real simplicity of this little girl's character, she (<font color='blue'><b>Helena</b></font>) was, as her (<font color='blue'><b>Helena</b></font>) mother had discovered, a nice observer, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Helena</b></font>) had remarked that her (<font color='blue'><b>Helena</b></font>) mother permitted no one but Marriott to go into the boudoir. This remark did not excite her (<font color='blue'><b>Helena</b></font>) to dive into the mystery: on the contrary, she (<font color='blue'><b>Helena</b></font>) carefully repressed all curiosity, remembering the promise she (<font color='blue'><b>Helena</b></font>) had given to her (<font color='blue'><b>Helena</b></font>) mother when she (<font color='blue'><b>Helena</b></font>) talked of Zobeide and the porter. She (<font color='blue'><b>Helena</b></font>) had not been without temptation to break this promise; for the maid who usually attended her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) toilette had employed every art in her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) power to stimulate her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) curiosity. As she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) was dressing Helena this morning, she (<font color='blue'><b>Helena</b></font>) had said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Helena</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``The reason I was so late calling you, miss, this morning, was because I was so late myself last night; for I went to the play, miss, last night, which was Bluebeard. Lord bless us! I'm sure, if I had been Bluebeard's wife, I should have opened the door, if I'd died for it; for to have the notion of living all day long, and all night too, in a house in which there was a room that one was never to go into, is a thing I could not put up with.''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>Then after a pause, and after waiting in vain for some reply from Helena, she (<font color='blue'><b>Helena</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``Pray, Miss Delacour, did you ever go into that little room within my lady's bedchamber, that Mrs Marriott keeps the key of always?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Helena/Miss Helena</b></font>)</div>said Helena.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've often wondered what's in it; but then that's only because I'm a simpleton. I thought to be sure, you knew.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Helena/Miss Helena</b></font>)</div><p/>Observing that Helena looked much displeased, she (<font color='blue'><b>Helena</b></font>) broke off her (<font color='blue'><b>Helena</b></font>) speech, hoping that what she (<font color='blue'><b>Helena</b></font>) had said would operate in due time, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Helena</b></font>) should thus excite the young lady to get the secret from Marriott, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) had no doubt afterward of worming from Miss Delacour.

<p/>In all this she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) calculated ill; for what she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) had said only made Helena distrust and dislike her (<font color='blue'><b>Helena</b></font>). It was the recollection of this conversation that made her (<font color='blue'><b>Helena</b></font>) follow the maid to her (<font color='blue'><b>Helena</b></font>) mother's bedchamber, to see what detained her (<font color='blue'><b>Helena</b></font>) there so long. Helena had heard Marriott say, that `she (<font color='blue'><b>Helena</b></font>) ought not to run up and down stairs, because her (<font color='blue'><b>Helena</b></font>) lady was asleep,'' and it appeared extraordinary that but a few minutes after this information she (<font color='blue'><b>Helena</b></font>) should have gone into the room with a glass of jelly in her (<font color='blue'><b>Helena</b></font>) hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, mamma!''  (<font color='red'><b>Helena/Miss Helena</b></font>)</div>thought Helena, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Helena</b></font>) stood beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Helena</b></font>) mother's bed, `you did not understand, and perhaps you did not believe me, when I said that I would not try to find out any thing that you wished me not to know. Now I hope you will understand me better.''

<p/>Lady Delacour opened her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) eyes: <div class="bookquote">``Helena,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>cried she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>), starting up, `how came you by that key?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, mother! don't look as if you suspected me.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) then told her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) mother how the key came into her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) hands.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear child, you have done me an essential service,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>said Lady Delacour: `you know not its importance, at least in my estimation. But what gives me infinitely more satisfaction, you have proved yourself worthy of my esteem -- my love.''

<p/>Marriott came into the room, and whispered a few words to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) lady.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You may speak out, Marriott, before my Helena,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>said Lady Delacour, rising from the bed as she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) spoke: `child as she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) is, Helena has deserved my confidence; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Helena</b></font>) shall be convinced that, where her (<font color='blue'><b>Helena</b></font>) mother has once reason to confide, she (<font color='blue'><b>Helena</b></font>) is incapable of suspicion. Wait here for a few minutes, my dear.''

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Helena</b></font>) went to her (<font color='blue'><b>Helena</b></font>) boudoir, paid and dismissed the surgeon expeditiously, then returned, and taking her (<font color='blue'><b>Helena</b></font>) daughter by the hand, she (<font color='blue'><b>Helena</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``You look all simplicity, my dear! I see you have no vulgar, school-girl curiosity. You will have all your mother's strength of mind; may you never have any of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) faults, or any of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) misfortunes! I speak to you not as to a child, Helena, for you have reason far above your years; and you will remember what I now say to you as long as you live. You will possess talents, beauty, fortune; you will be admired, followed, and flattered, as I have been: but do not throw away your life as I have thrown away mine -- to win the praise of fools. Had I used but half the talents I possess, as I hope you will use yours, I might have been an ornament to my sex -- I might have been a Lady Anne Percival.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Here Lady Delacour's voice failed; but commanding her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) emotion, she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) in a few moments went on speaking.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Choose your friends well, my dear daughter! It was my misfortune, my folly, early in life to connect myself with a woman, who under the name of frolic led me into every species of mischief. You are too young, too innocent, to hear the particulars of my history now; but you will hear them all at a proper time from my best friend, Miss Portman. I shall leave you to her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) care, my dear, when I die.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``When you die! -- Oh, mother!''  (<font color='red'><b>Helena/Miss Helena</b></font>)</div>said Helena, `but why do you talk of dying?'' and she (<font color='blue'><b>Helena</b></font>) threw her (<font color='blue'><b>Helena</b></font>) arms round her (<font color='blue'><b>Helena</b></font>) mother.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Gently, my love!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>said Lady Delacour, shrinking back; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) seized this moment to explain to her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) daughter why she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) shrunk in this manner from her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) caresses, and why she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) talked of dying.

<p/>Helena was excessively shocked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wished, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>resumed her (<font color='blue'><b>Helena</b></font>) mother, calmly, ``I wished to have spared you the pain of knowing all this. I have given you but little pleasure in my life; it is unjust to give you so much pain. We shall go to Twickenham to-morrow, and I will leave you with your Aunt Margaret, my dear, till all is over. If I die, Belinda will take you with her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) immediately to Oakly-park -- you shall have as little sorrow as possible. If you had shown me less of your affectionate temper, you would have spared yourself the anguish that you now feel, and you would have spared me -- '

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear, kind mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>Helena/Miss Helena</b></font>)</div>interrupted Helena, throwing herself on her (<font color='blue'><b>Helena</b></font>) knees at her (<font color='blue'><b>Helena</b></font>) mother's feet, `do not sent me away from you -- I don't wish to go to my Aunt Margaret -- I don't wish to go to Oakly-park -- I wish to stay with you. Do not send me away from you; for I shall suffer ten times more if I am not with you, though I know I can be of no use.''

<p/>Overcome by her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) daughter's entreaties, Lady Delacour at last consented that she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) should remain with her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>), and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) should accompany her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) to Twickenham.

<p/>The remainder of this day was taken up in preparations for their departure. The stupid maid was immediately dismissed. No questions were asked, and no reasons for her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) dismissal assigned, except that Lady Delacour had no farther occasion for her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) services. Marriott alone was to attend her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) lady to Twickenham. Lord Delacour, it was settled, should stay in town, lest the unusual circumstance of his (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) attending his (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) lady should excite public curiosity. His (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) lordship, who was naturally a good-natured man, and who had been touched by the kindness his (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) wife had lately shown him (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>), was in extreme agitation during the whole of this day, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) thought might possibly be the last of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) existence. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), on the contrary, was calm and collected; her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) courage seemed to rise with the necessity for its exertion.

<p/>In the morning, when the carriage came to the door, as she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) parted with Lord Delacour, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) put into his (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) hand a paper that contained some directions and requests with which, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) said, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) hoped that he (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) would comply, if they should prove to be her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) last. The paper contained only some legacies to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) servants, a provision for Marriott, and a bequest to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) excellent and beloved friend, Belinda Portman, of the cabinet in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) kept Clarence Hervey's letters.

<p/>Interlined in this place, Lady Delacour had written these words: <div class="bookquote">``My daughter is nobly provided for; and lest any doubt or difficulty should arise from the omission, I think it necessary to mention that the said cabinet contains the valuable jewels left to me by my late uncle, and that it is my intention that the said jewels should be part of my bequest to the said Belinda Portman. -- If she (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) marry a man of good fortune, she (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) will wear them for my sake: if she (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) do not marry an opulent husband, I hope she (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) will sell the jewels without scruple, as they are intended for her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) convenience, and not as an ostentatious bequest. It is fit that she (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) should be as independent in her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) circumstances as she (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) is in her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) mind.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div><p/>Lord Delacour with much emotion looked over this paper, and assured her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) ladyship that she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) should be obeyed, if -- He (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) could say no more.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Farewell, then, my lord!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>): `keep up your spirits, for I intend to live many years yet to try them.''

<p/>CHAPTER XXII

<p/>A Spectre

<p/>THE surgeon who was to attend Lady Delacour was prevented from going to her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) on the day appointed; he (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) was one of the surgeons of the queen's household, and his (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) attendance was required at the palace. This delay was extremely irksome to Lady Delacour, who had worked up her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) courage to the highest point, but who had not prepared herself to endure suspense. She (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) spent nearly a week at Twickenham in this anxious state, and Belinda observed that she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) every day became more and more thoughtful and reserved. She (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) seemed as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) had some secret subject of meditation, from which she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) could not bear to be distracted. When Helena was present, she (<font color='blue'><b>Helena</b></font>) exerted herself to converse in her (<font color='blue'><b>Helena</b></font>) usual sprightly strain; but as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Helena</b></font>) could escape, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Helena</b></font>) thought, unobserved, she (<font color='blue'><b>Helena</b></font>) would shut herself up in her (<font color='blue'><b>Helena</b></font>) own apartment, and remain there for hours.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish to Heaven, Miss Portman,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marriott/Mrs Marriott</b></font>)</div>said Marriott, coming one morning into her (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) room with a portentous face, <div class="bookquote">``I wish to Heaven, ma'am, that you could any way persuade my lady not to spend so many hours of the day and night as she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) does in reading those methodistical books that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) keeps to herself! -- I am sure that they do her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) no good, but a great deal of harm, especially now when her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) spirits should be kept up as much as possible. I am sensible, ma'am, that `tis those books that have made my lady melancholy of a sudden. Ma'am, my lady has let drop very odd hints within these two or three days, and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) speaks in a strange disconnected sort of style, and at times I do not think she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) is quite right in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) head.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Marriott/Mrs Marriott</b></font>)</div><p/>When Belinda questioned Marriott more particularly about the strange hints which her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) lady had let fall, she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) with looks of embarrassment and horror declined repeating the words that had been said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>); yet persisted in asserting that Lady Delacour had been very strange for these two or three days. <div class="bookquote">``And I'm sure, ma'am, you'd be shocked if you were to see my lady in a morning, when she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) wakens, or rather when I first go into the room -- for, as to wakening, that's out of the question. I am certain she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) does not sleep during the whole night. You'll find, ma'am, it is as I tell you, those books will quite turn her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) poor head, and I wish they were burnt. I know the mischief that the same sort of things did to a poor cousin of my own, who was driven to melancholy mad by a methodist preacher, and came to an untimely end. Oh, ma'am! if you knew as much as I do, you'd be as much alarmed for my lady as I am.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Marriott/Mrs Marriott</b></font>)</div><p/>It was impossible to prevail upon Marriott to explain herself more distinctly. The only circumstances that could be drawn from her (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) seemed to Belinda so trifling as to be scarcely worth mentioning. For instance, that Lady Delacour, contrary to Marriott's advice, had insisted on sleeping in a bedchamber upon the ground floor, and had refused to let a curtain be put up before a glass door that was at the foot of her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) bed. ``When I offered to put up the curtain, ma``am,'' said Marriot, `my lady said she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) liked the moonlight, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) would not have it put up till the fine nights were over. Now, Miss Portman, to hear my lady talk of the moon, and moonlights, and liking the moon, is rather extraordinary and unaccountable; for I never heard her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) say any thing of the sort in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) life before; I question whether she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) ever knew there was a moon or not from one year's end to another. But they say the moon has a great deal to do with mad people; and, from my own experience, I'm perfectly sensible, ma'am, it had in my cousin's case; for, before he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) came to the worst, he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) took a prodigious fancy to the moon, and was always for walking by moonlight, and talking to one of the beauty of the moon, and such melancholy nonsense, ma<div class="bookquote">``am.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div><p/>Belinda could not forbear smiling at the melancholy nonsense; though she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) was inclined to be of Marriott's opinion about the methodistical books, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) determined to talk to Lady Delacour on the subject. The moment that she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) made the attempt, her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) ladyship, commanding her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) countenance, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) usual ability, replied only by cautious, cold monosyllables, and changed the conversation as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) could.

<p/>At night, when they were retiring to rest, Marriott, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) lighted them to their rooms, observed that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) was afraid her (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) lady would suffer from sleeping in so cold a bedchamber, and Belinda pressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) friend to change her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) apartment.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>replied Lady Delacour, calmly. <div class="bookquote">``I have chosen this for my bedchamber, because it is at a distance from the servants' rooms; and when the operation, which I have to go through, shall be performed, my cries, if I should utter any, will not be overheard. The surgeon will be here in a few days, and it is not worth while to make any change.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the surgeon X</b></font>)</div><p/>The next day, towards evening, the surgeon and Dr X-- arrived. Belinda's blood ran cold at the sight of them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Will you be so kind, Miss Portman,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marriott/Mrs Marriott</b></font>)</div>said Marriott, `as to let my lady know that they are come? for I am not well able to go, and you can speak more composed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) than I can.''

<p/>Miss Portman went to Lady Delacour's bedchamber. The door was bolted. As Lady Delacour opened it, she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) fixed her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) eyes upon Belinda, and said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) with a mild voice, <div class="bookquote">``You are come to tell me that the surgeon is arrived. I knew that by the manner in which you knocked at the door. I will see him (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) this moment,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>continued she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>), in a firm tone; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) deliberately put a mark in the book which she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) had been reading, walked leisurely to the other end of the room, and locked it up in her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) book-case. There was an air of determined dignity in all her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) motions. <div class="bookquote">``Shall we go? I am ready,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>), holding out her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) hand to Belinda, who had sunk upon a chair.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``One would think that you were the person that was going to suffer. But drink this water, my dear, and do not tremble for me; you see that I do not tremble for myself. Listen to me, dearest Belinda! I owe it to your friendship not to torment you with unnecessary apprehensions. Your humanity shall be spared this dreadful scene.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Belinda, <div class="bookquote">``Marriott is incapable of attending you, I must -- I will -- I am ready now. Forgive me one moment's weakness. I admire, and will imitate, your courage. I will keep my promise.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Your promise was to be with me in my dying moments, and to let me breathe my last in your arms.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope that I shall never be called upon to perform that promise.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div><p/>Lady Delacour made no answer, but walked on before her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) with steady steps into the room where Dr X-- and the surgeon were waiting. Without adverting in the least to the object of their visit, she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) paid her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) compliments to them, as if they came on a visit of mere civility. Without seeming to notice the serious countenances of her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) companions, she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) talked of indifferent subjects with the most perfect ease, occupying herself all the time with cleaning a seal, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) unhooked from her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) watch-chain. <div class="bookquote">``This seal,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>), turning to Dr X--, `is a fine onyx -- it is a head of Esculapius. I have a great value for it. It was given to me by your friend, Clarence Hervey; and I have left it in my will, doctor,<div class="bookquote">'' continued she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>), smiling, `to you, as no slight token of my regard. He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) is an excellent young man; and I request,''  (<font color='red'><b>doctor</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>), drawing Dr X-- to a window, and lowering her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) voice, <div class="bookquote">``I request, when you see him (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) again, and when I am out of the way, that you will tell him (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) such were my sentiments to the hour of my death. Here is a letter which you will have the goodness to put into his (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) hands, sealed with my favourite seal. You need have no scruple to take charge of it; it relates not to myself. It expresses only my opinion concerning a lady who stands almost as high in your esteem, I believe, as she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) does in mine. My affection and my gratitude have not biassed my judgment in the advice which I have ventured to give to Mr Hervey.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dr</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) will soon be here,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dr</b></font>)</div>interrupted Dr X--, `and then -- '

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And then I shall be gone,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dr</b></font>)</div>said Lady Delacour, coolly,

<p/>'<div class="bookquote">``To that undiscover'd country,
From whose bourn no traveller returns.'' (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>'
Dr X-- was going to interrupt her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>), but she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) continued rapidly, <div class="bookquote">``And now, my dear doctor, tell me candidly, have you seen any symptoms of cowardice in my manner this evening?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``None,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>replied he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``On the contrary, I have admired your calm self-possession.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then do not suspect me of want of fortitude, when I request that this operation may not be performed to-day. I have changed my mind within these few hours. I have determined, for a reason which I am sure that you would feel to be sufficient, to postpone this affair till to-morrow. Believe me, I do not act from caprice.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) saw that Dr X-- did not yield assent to her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) last assertion, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) looked displeased.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I will tell you my reason,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>); `and then you will have no right to be displeased if I persist, as I shall inflexibly, in my determination. It is my belief that I shall die this night. To submit to a painful operation to-day would be only to sacrifice the last moments of my existence to no purpose. If I survive this night, manage me as you please! But I am the best judge of my own feelings -- I shall die to-night.''

<p/>``Dr X-- looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) with a mixture of astonishment and compassion. Her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) pulse was high, she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) was extremely feverish, and he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) thought that the best thing which he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) could do was to stay with her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) till the next day, and to endeavour to divert her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) mind from this fancy, which he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) considered as an insane idea. He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) prevailed upon the surgeon to stay with her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) till the next morning; and he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) communicated his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) intentions to Belinda, who joined with him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) in doing all that was possible to entertain and interest her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) by conversation during the remainder of the day. She (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) had sufficient penetration to perceive that they gave not the least faith to her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) prognostic, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) never said one word more upon the subject; but appeared willing to be amused by their attempts to divert her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>), and resolute to support her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) courage to the last moment. She (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) did not affect trifling gaiety: on the contrary, there was in all she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) said more strength and less point than usual.

<p/>The evening passed away, and Lady Delacour seemed totally to have forgotten her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) own prophecy respecting the event of the ensuing night; so much so, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) spoke of several things that she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) intended to do the next day. Helena knew nothing of what had passed, and Belinda imagined that her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) friend put this constraint upon herself to avoid alarming her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) daughter. Yet, after Helena retired, her (<font color='blue'><b>Helena</b></font>) mother's manner continued to be so much the same, that Dr X-- began to believe that her (<font color='blue'><b>Helena</b></font>) ladyship was actuated merely by caprice. In this opinion she (<font color='blue'><b>Helena</b></font>) confirmed him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) by bursting out a laughing when he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) proposed that some one should sit up with her (<font color='blue'><b>Helena</b></font>) during the night.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My sage sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>), `have you lived to this time without ever having been duped by a woman before? I wanted a day's reprieve, and I have gained it -- gained a day, spent in most agreeable conversation, for which I thank you. To-morrow,'' said she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), turning to the surgeon, <div class="bookquote">``I must invent some new excuse for my cowardice; and though I give you notice for it beforehand, as Barrington did when he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) picked the man's pocket, yet, nevertheless, I shall succeed. Good night!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hurried to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) own apartment, leaving them all in astonishment and perplexity. Belinda was persuaded that she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) only affected this gaiety to prevent Dr X-- from insisting upon sitting up in her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) room, as he (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) had proposed. Doctor X--, judging, as he (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) said, from her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) ladyship's general character, attributed the whole to caprice; and the surgeon, judging, as he (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) said, from human nature in general, was decided in his (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) belief that she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) had been influenced, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) herself declared, by cowardice. After having all expressed their opinions, without making any impression upon one another, they retired to rest.

<p/>Belinda's bedchamber was next to Helena's; and after she (<font color='blue'><b>Helena</b></font>) had been in bed about an hour, she (<font color='blue'><b>Helena</b></font>) fancied that she (<font color='blue'><b>Helena</b></font>) heard some one walking softly in the next room. She (<font color='blue'><b>Helena</b></font>) rose, and found Lady Delacour standing beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) daughter's bed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) started at the sight of Belinda, but only said in a low voice, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) pointed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) child, <div class="bookquote">``Don't waken her (<font color='blue'><b>Helena</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>child</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) then looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) for some moments in silence. The moon shone full upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) face. She (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) stooped over Helena, parted the ringlets of hair upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Helena</b></font>) forehead, and kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Helena</b></font>) gently.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You will be good to this poor girl when I am gone, Belinda!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Helena</b></font>), turning away from her (<font color='blue'><b>Helena</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>Helena</b></font>) spoke: <div class="bookquote">``I only came to look at her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) for the last time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you then serious, my dear Lady Delacour?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hush! Don't waken her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>said Lady Delacour, putting her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) finger on her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) lips; and walking slowly out of the room, she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) forbade Belinda to follow.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If my fears be vain,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>), `why should I disturb you with them? If they be just, you will hear my bell ring, and then come to me.''

<p/>For some time afterward all was perfectly silent in the house. Belinda did not go to bed, but sat waiting and listening anxiously. The clock struck two; and as she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) heard no other sound, she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) began to hope that she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) had suffered herself to be falsely alarmed by a foolish imagination, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) lay down upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) bed, resolving to compose herself to rest. She (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) was just sinking to sleep, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) heard the faint sound of a bell. She (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) was not sure whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) was dreaming or awake. She (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) started up and listened. All was silent. But in a few minutes Lady Delacour's bell rang violently. Belinda flew to her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) room. The surgeon was already there; he (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) had been sitting up in the next room to write letters, and he (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) had heard the first sound of the bell. Lady Delacour was senseless, supported in the surgeon's arms. Belinda, by his (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) directions, ran immediately for Doctor X--, who was at the other end of the house. Before she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) returned, Lady Delacour had recovered her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) senses. She (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) begged that the surgeon would leave the room, and that neither Dr X-- nor Marriott might be yet admitted, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) had something of importance to communicate to Miss Portman. The surgeon withdrew, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) beckoned to Belinda, who sat down upon the side of her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) bed. Lady Delacour held out her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) hand to her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>); it was covered with a cold dew.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear friend,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>), `my prophecy is accomplishing -- I know I must die.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The surgeon said that you were not in the least danger, my dear Lady Delacour; that it was merely a fainting fit. Do not suffer a vain imagination thus to overpower your reason.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is no vain imagination -- I must die,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>said Lady Delacour.

<p/>'<div class="bookquote">``I hear a voice you cannot hear,
Which says I must not stay;
I see a hand you cannot see,
Which beckons me away.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>You perceive that I am in my perfect senses, my dear, or I could not quote poetry. I am not insane -- I am not delirious.''
She (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) paused -- <div class="bookquote">``I am ashamed to tell you what I know will expose me to your ridicule.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ridicule!''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>cried Belinda: `can you think me so cruel as to consider your sufferings a subject for ridicule!''

<p/>Lady Delacour was overcome by the tenderness with which Belinda spoke.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I will then speak to you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>), `without reserve. Inconsistent as it is with the strength of mind which you might expect from me, I cannot resist the impression which has been made on my mind by -- a vision.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A vision!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Three times,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>continued Lady Delacour, `it has appeared to me about this hour. The first night after we came here I saw it; last night it returned; and to-night I have beheld it for the third time. I consider it as a warning to prepare for death. You are surprised -- you are incredulous. I know that this must appear to you extravagant; but depend upon it that what I tell you is true. It is scarcely a quarter of an hour since I beheld the figure of --, that man for whose untimely death I am answerable. Whenever I close my eyes the same form appears before me.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``These visions,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Belinda, `are certainly the effects of opium.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The forms that flit before my eyes when I am between sleeping and waking,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>said Lady Delacour, <div class="bookquote">``I am willing to believe, are the effects of opium; but, Belinda, it is impossible I should be convinced that my senses have deceived me with respect to what I have beheld when I have been as broad awake, and in perfect possession of my understanding as I am at this instant. The habits of my life, and the natural gaiety, not to say levity, of my temper, have always inclined me rather to incredulity than to superstition. But there are things which no strength of mind, no temerity can resist. I repeat it -- this is a warning to me to prepare for death. No human means, no human power can save me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div><p/>Here they were interrupted by Marriott, who could no longer be restrained from bursting into the room. Dr X-- followed, and going calmly to the side of Lady Delacour's bed, took her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) hand to feel her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) pulse.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mrs Marriott, you need not alarm yourself in this manner,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>): `your lady is at this instant in as little danger as I am.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You think she (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>)'ll live! Oh, my lady! Why did you terrify us in this manner?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div><p/>Lady Delacour smiled, and calmly said, as Doctor X-- still continued to count her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) pulse, ``The pulse may deceive you, doctor, but I do not. Marriott, you may -- '

<p/>Belinda heard no more; for at this instant, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) was standing alone, near the glass-door that was opposite to the bed, she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) saw at a distance in the garden the figure which Lady Delacour had described. Lady Delacour was now so intent upon speaking to Dr X--, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) saw nothing but him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>). Belinda had the presence of mind to be perfectly silent. The figure stood still for some moments. She (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) advanced a few steps nearer to the window, and the figure vanished. She (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) eye steadily fixed upon the spot where it had disappeared, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) saw it rise again and glide quickly behind some bushes. Belinda beckoned to Dr X--, who perceived by the eagerness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) manner, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) wished to speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) immediately. He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) resigned his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) patient to Marriott, and followed Miss Portman out of the room. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) told him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) what she (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) had just seen, said it was of the utmost consequence to Lady Delacour to have the truth ascertained, and requested that Dr X-- would go with some of the men-servants and search the garden, to discover whether any one was there concealed, or whether any footsteps could be traced. The doctor did not search long before he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) perceived footsteps in the borders opposite to the glass-door of Lady Delacour's bedchamber; he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) was carefully following their track, when he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) heard a loud cry, which seemed to come from the other side of the garden wall. There was a breach in the wall over which he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) scrambled with some difficulty. The screams continued with redoubled violence. As he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) was making his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) way to the spot from which they proceeded, he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) was met by the old gardener, who was crossing one of the walks with a lantern in his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ho! ho!''  (<font color='red'><b>the gardener</b></font>)</div>cried the gardener, <div class="bookquote">``I take it that we have the thief at last. I fancy that the fellow whose footsteps I traced, and who has been at my morello cherry-tree every night, has been caught in the trap. I hope his (<font color='blue'><b>thief</b></font>) leg is not broke, though! -- This way, sir -- this way!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the gardener</b></font>)</div><p/>The gardener led the doctor to the place and there they found a man, whose leg had actually been caught in the spring-trap which had been set for the defence of the cherry-tree. The man had by this time fallen into a swoon; they extricated him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) as fast as possible, and Doctor X-- had him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) brought to Lady Delacour's in order that the surgeon, who was there, might see his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) leg.

<p/>As they were carrying him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) across the hall, Belinda met them. She (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) poured out a glass of water for the man, who was just recovering from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) swoon; but as she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) went nearer to give it him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) was struck with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wonderful resemblance to Harriot Freke.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It must be Mrs Freke herself!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>whispered she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) to Marriott, whose wide opening eyes, at this instant, fixed themselves upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>).

<p/>``It must be Mrs Freke herself, ma<div class="bookquote">``am!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>repeated Marriott.

<p/>And so in fact it was.

<p/>There is a certain class of people, who are incapable of generous confidence in their equals, but who are disposed to yield implicit credit to the underhand information of mean emissaries. Through the medium of Champfort and the stupid maid, Mrs Freke had learned a confused story of a man's footsteps having been heard in Lady Delacour's boudoir, of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) being let in by Marriott secretly, of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) having remained locked up there for several hours, and of the maid's having been turned away, merely because she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) innocently went to open the door whilst the gentleman was in concealment. Mrs Freke was farther informed by the same unquestionable authority, that Lady Delacour had taken a house at Twickenham, for the express purpose of meeting her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) lover: that Miss Portman and Marriott were the only persons who were to be of this party of pleasure.

<p/>Upon the faith of this intelligence, Mrs Freke, who had accompanied Mrs Luttridge to town, immediately repaired to Twickenham, to pay a visit to a third cousin, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Freke</b></font>) might have an opportunity of detecting the intrigues, and afterwards of publishing the disgrace, of her (<font color='blue'><b>Freke</b></font>) former friend. The desire of revenging herself upon Miss Portman, for having declined her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) civilities at Harrowgate, had also a powerful influence in stimulating her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) malicious activity. She (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) knew that if it were proved that Belinda was the confidante of Lady Delacour's intrigues, her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) reputation must be materially injured, and that the Percivals would then be as desirous to break off as they now were anxious to promote the match with Mr Vincent. Charmed with this hope of a double triumph, the vindictive lady commenced her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) operations, nor was she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) ashamed to descend to the character of a spy. The general and convenient name of frolic, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) thought, would cover every species of meanness. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) swore that `it was charming fun to equip herself at night in men's clothes, and to sally forth to reconnoitre the motions of the enemy.''

<p/>By an unfrequented path she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) used to gain the window that looked into Lady Delacour's bedchamber. This was the figure which appeared at night at a certain hour, and which, to her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) ladyship's disturbed imagination, seemed to be the form of Colonel Lawless. There was, indeed, a resemblance in their size and persons, which favoured the delusion. For several nights Mrs Freke paid these visits without obtaining any satisfaction; but this night she (<font color='blue'><b>Freke</b></font>) thought herself overpaid for her (<font color='blue'><b>Freke</b></font>) exertions, by the charming discovery which she (<font color='blue'><b>Freke</b></font>) fancied she (<font color='blue'><b>Freke</b></font>) had made. She (<font color='blue'><b>Freke</b></font>) mistook the surgeon for a lover of Lady Delacour's; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) was hurrying home with the joyful intelligence, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) was caught in the gardener's trap. The agony that she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) suffered was at first intense, but in a few hours that pain somewhat subsided; and in this interval of rest she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) turned to Belinda, and with a malicious smile said, -- <div class="bookquote">``Miss Portman, `tis fair I should pay for my peeping; but I shall not pay quite so dear for it as some of my friends.''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>Miss Portman did not in the least comprehend her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>), till she (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``I'm sure you'll allow that `tis better for a lady to lose her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) leg than her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) reputation -- and for my part I'd rather be caught in a man trap, than have a man caught in my bedchamber. My service to your friend, Lady Delacour, and tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And do you know who that gentleman was, that you saw in her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) ladyship's room?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not I, not yet; but I'll make it my business to find out. I give you fair notice; I'm a very devil when provoked. Why didn't you make me your friend when you could? -- You'll not baffle me. I have seen all I wanted, and I am capable of painting all I saw. As to who the man might be, that's no matter; one Lothario is as good as another for my purpose.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs</b></font>)</div><p/>Longer had Mrs Freke spoken with malignant triumph, had she (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>) not been interrupted by a burst of laughter from the surgeon. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>) vexation was indescribable when he (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) informed her (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>), that he (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) was the man whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>) had seen in Lady Delacour's bedchamber, and whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) had mistaken for a favoured lover.

<p/>Mrs Freke's leg was much cut and bruised; and now that she (<font color='blue'><b>Freke</b></font>) was no longer supported by the hopes of revenge, she (<font color='blue'><b>Freke</b></font>) began to lament loudly and incessantly the injury that she (<font color='blue'><b>Freke</b></font>) had sustained. She (<font color='blue'><b>Freke</b></font>) impatiently inquired how long it was probable that she (<font color='blue'><b>Freke</b></font>) should be confined by this accident; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Freke</b></font>) grew quite outrageous when it was hinted, that the beauty of her (<font color='blue'><b>Freke</b></font>) legs would be spoiled, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Freke</b></font>) would never more be able to appear to advantage in man's apparel. The dread of being seen by Lady Delacour in the deplorable yet ludicrous situation to which she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) had reduced herself operated next upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) mind, and every time the door of the apartment opened, she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) looked with terror towards it, expecting to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) ladyship appear. But though Lady Delacour heard from Marriott immediately the news of Mrs Freke's disaster, she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) never disturbed her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) by her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) presence. She (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) was too generous to insult a fallen foe.

<p/>Early in the morning Mrs Freke was by her (<font color='blue'><b>Freke</b></font>) own desire conveyed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Freke</b></font>) cousin's house, where without regret we shall leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Freke</b></font>) to suffer the consequences of her (<font color='blue'><b>Freke</b></font>) frolic.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A false prophetess! Notwithstanding all my visions, I have outlived the night, you see,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>said Lady Delacour to Miss Portman when they met in the morning. <div class="bookquote">``I have heard, my dear Belinda, and I believe, that the passion of love, which can endure caprice, vice, wrinkles, deformity, poverty, nay, disease itself, is notwithstanding so squeamish as to be instantaneously disgusted by the perception of folly in the object beloved. I hope friendship, though akin to love, is of a more robust constitution, else what would become of me? My folly, and my visions, and my spectre -- oh, that I had not exposed myself to you in this manner! Harriot Freke herself is scarcely more contemptible. Spies and cowards are upon equal footing. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Freke</b></font>) malice and her (<font color='blue'><b>Freke</b></font>) frolic are consistent with her (<font color='blue'><b>Freke</b></font>) character, but my fears and my superstition are totally inconsistent with mine. Forget the nonsense I talked to you last night, my dear, or fancy that I was then under the dominion of laudanum. This morning you shall see Lady Delacour herself again. Is Dr X--, is the surgeon ready? Where are they? I am prepared. My fortitude shall redeem me in your opinion, Belinda, and in my own.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Doctor</b></font>)</div><p/>Doctor X-- and the surgeon immediately obeyed her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) summons.

<p/>Helena heard them go into Lady Delacour's room, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) saw by Marriott's countenance, who followed, that her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) mother was going to submit to the operation. She (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) sat down trembling on the steps which led to her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) mother's room, and waited there a long time, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) thought, in the most painful suspense. At last she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) heard some one call Helena. She (<font color='blue'><b>Helena</b></font>) looked up, and saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Helena</b></font>) father close to her (<font color='blue'><b>Helena</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Helena,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), `how is your mother?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know. Oh, papa, you cannot go in there now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Helena/Miss Helena</b></font>)</div>said Helena, stopping him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was pressing forwards.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why did not you or Miss Portman write to me yesterday, as you promised?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Delacour</b></font>)</div>said Lord Delacour, in a voice that showed he (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) was scarcely able to ask the question.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Because, papa, we had nothing to tell you: nothing was done yesterday. But the surgeon is now there,''  (<font color='red'><b>Helena/Miss Helena</b></font>)</div>said Helena, pointing towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Helena</b></font>) mother's room.

<p/>Lord Delacour stood motionless for an instant; then suddenly seizing his (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) daughter's hand, <div class="bookquote">``Let us go,''  (<font color='red'><b>daughter</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>): `if we stay here, we shall hear her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) screams;' and he (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) was hurrying her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) away, when the door of Lady Delacour's apartment opened, and Belinda appeared, her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) countenance radiant with joy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good news, dear Helena! Oh, my lord! you are come in a happy moment -- I give you joy!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Joy! joy! joy!''  (<font color='red'><b>Marriott/Mrs Marriott</b></font>)</div>cried Marriott, following.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it all over?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Delacour</b></font>)</div>said Lord Delacour.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And without a single shriek!''  (<font color='red'><b>Helena/Miss Helena</b></font>)</div>said Helena. <div class="bookquote">``What courage!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There's no need of shrieks, or courage, either, thank God,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marriott/Mrs Marriott</b></font>)</div>said Marriott. <div class="bookquote">``Dr X-- says so, and he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) is the best man in the world, and the cleverest. And I was right from the first; I said it was impossible my lady should have such a shocking complaint as she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) thought she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had. There's no such thing at all in the case, my lord! I said so always, till I was persuaded out of my senses by that villainous quack, who contradicted me for his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) own `molument. And Doctor X-- says, if my lady will leave off the terrible quantities of laudanum she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) takes, he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>)'ll engage for her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) recovery.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The surgeon X</b></font>)</div><p/>The surgeon and Dr X-- now explained to Lord Delacour that the unprincipled wretch to whom her (<font color='blue'><b>Helena</b></font>) ladyship had applied for assistance had persuaded her (<font color='blue'><b>Helena</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Helena</b></font>) had a cancer, though in fact her (<font color='blue'><b>Helena</b></font>) complaint arose merely from the bruise which she (<font color='blue'><b>Helena</b></font>) had received. He (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) knew too well how to make a wound hideous and painful, and so continue her (<font color='blue'><b>Helena</b></font>) delusion for his (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) own advantage. Dr X-- observed, that if Lady Delacour would have permitted either the surgeon or him (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) to have examined sooner into the real state of the case, it would have saved herself infinite pain, and them all anxiety. Belinda at this moment felt too much to speak.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm morally certain,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marriott/Mrs Marriott</b></font>)</div>cried Marriott, <div class="bookquote">``Mr Champfort would die with vexation, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Champfort</b></font>) could see the joy that's painted in my lord's face this minute. And we may thank Miss Portman for this, for 'twas she (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) made every thing go right, and I never expected to live to see so happy a day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Marriott/Mrs Marriott</b></font>)</div><p/>Whilst Marriott ran on in this manner with all the volubility of joy, Lord Delacour passed her (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) with some difficulty, and Helena was in her (<font color='blue'><b>Helena</b></font>) mother's arms in an instant.

<p/>Lady Delacour, struck to the heart by their affectionate looks and words, burst into tears. <div class="bookquote">``How little have I deserved this kindness from you, my lord! or from you, my child! But my feelings,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>added she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>), wiping away her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) tears, `shall not waste themselves in tears, nor in vain thanks. My actions, the whole course of my future life, shall show that I am not quite a brute. Even brutes are won by kindness. Observe, my lord,'' continued she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>), smiling, <div class="bookquote">``I said won, not tamed! -- A tame Lady Delacour would be a sorry animal, not worth looking at. Were she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) even to become domesticated, she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) would fare the worse.''

 (<font color='red'><b>lord</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How so? -- How so, my dear?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Delacour</b></font>)</div>said Lord Delacour and Belinda almost in the same breath.

<p/>``How so? -- Why, if Lady Delacour were to wash off her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) rouge, and lay aside her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) air, and be as gentle, good, and kind as Belinda Portman, for instance, her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) lord would certainly say to her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>),

<p/>``So alter'd are your face and mind,
<div class="bookquote">``Twere perjury to love you now.''
 (<font color='red'><b>The Chaplain</b></font>)</div>CHAPTER XXIII

<p/>The Chaplain

<p/>IN some minds, emotions of joy are always connected with feelings of benevolence and generosity. Lady Delacour's heart expanded with the sensations of friendship and gratitude, now that she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) was relieved from those fears by which she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) had so long been oppressed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear daughter,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) to Helena, `have you at this instant any wish that I can gratify? -- Ask any thing you please, the fairy Goodwill shall contrive to get it for you in a trice. You have thought of a wish at this moment, I know, by your eyes, by your blush. Nay, do not hesitate. Do you doubt me because I do not appear before you in the shape of a little ugly woman, like Cinderella's godmother? or do you despise me because you do not see a wand waving in my hand? -- <div class="bookquote">``Ah, little skilled of fairy lore!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>know that I am in possession of a talisman that can command more than ever fairy granted. Behold my talisman,'' continued she (<font color='blue'><b>fairy</b></font>), drawing out her (<font color='blue'><b>fairy</b></font>) purse, and showing the gold through the net-work. ``Speak boldly, then,<div class="bookquote">'' cried she (<font color='blue'><b>fairy</b></font>) to Helena, `and be obeyed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, mamma,''  (<font color='red'><b>Helena/Miss Helena</b></font>)</div>said Helena, <div class="bookquote">``I was not thinking of what fairies or gold can give; but you can grant my wish, and if you will let me, I will whisper it to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Helena/Miss Helena</b></font>)</div><p/>Lady Delacour stooped to hear her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) daughter's whisper.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your wish is granted, my own grateful, charming girl,''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) mother.

<p/>Helena's wish was, that her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) mother could be reconciled to her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) good aunt, Margaret Delacour.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) ladyship sat down instantly, and wrote to Mrs Delacour. Helena was the bearer of this letter, and Lady Delacour promised to wait upon this excellent old lady as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) should return to town.

<p/>In the meantime her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) ladyship's health rapidly improved under the skilful care of Dr X--: it had been terribly injured by the ignorance and villany of the wretch to whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) had so long and so rashly trusted. The nostrums which he (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) persuaded her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) to take, and the immoderate use of opium to which she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) accustomed herself, would have ruined her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) constitution, had it not been uncommonly strong. Dr X-- recommended it to her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) ladyship to abstain gradually from opium, and this advice she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) had the resolution to follow with uninterrupted perseverance.

<p/>The change in Lady Delacour's manner of life, in the hours and the company that she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) kept, contributed much to her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) recovery. 9 She (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) was no longer in continual anxiety to conceal the state of her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) health from the world. She (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) had no secret to keep -- no part to act; her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) reconciliation with her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) husband and with his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) friends restored her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) mind to ease and self-complacency. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) little Helena was a source of daily pleasure; and no longer conscious of neglecting her (<font color='blue'><b>Helena</b></font>) daughter, she (<font color='blue'><b>Helena</b></font>) no longer feared that the affections of her (<font color='blue'><b>Helena</b></font>) child should be alienated. Dr X--, well aware that the passions have a powerful influence over the body, thought it full as necessary, in some cases, to attend to the mind as to the pulse. By conversing with Lady Delacour, and by combining hints and circumstances, he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) soon discovered what had lately been the course of her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) reading, and what impression it had made on her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) imagination. Mrs Marriott, indeed, assisted him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) with her (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) opinion concerning the methodistical books; and when he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) recollected the forebodings of death which her (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) ladyship had felt, and the terror with which she (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) had been seized on the night of Mrs Freke's adventure, he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was convinced that superstitious horrors hung upon his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) patient's spirits, and affected her (<font color='blue'><b>Freke</b></font>) health. To argue on religious subjects was not his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) province, much less his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) inclination; but he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was acquainted with a person qualified by his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) profession and his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) character `to minister to a mind diseased,'' and he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) resolved on the first favourable opportunity to introduce this gentleman to her (<font color='blue'><b>Freke</b></font>) ladyship.

<p/>One morning Lady Delacour was complaining to Belinda, that the books in the library were in dreadful confusion. <div class="bookquote">``My lord has really a very fine library,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>); `but I wish he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had half as many books twice as well arranged: I never can find any thing I want. Dr X--, I wish to heaven you could recommend a librarian to my lord -- not a chaplain, observe.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why not a chaplain, may I ask your ladyship?''  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>said the doctor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, because we had once a chaplain, who gave me a surfeit of the whole tribe. The meanest sycophant, yet the most impertinent busybody -- always cringing, yet always intriguing -- wanting to govern the whole family, and at the same time every creature's humble servant -- fawning to my lord the bishop, insolent to the poor curate -- anathematizing all who differed from him (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) in opinion, yet without dignity to enforce the respect due to his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) faith or his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) profession -- greedy for preferment, yet without a thought of the duties of his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) office. It was the common practice of this man to leap from his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) horse at the church door on a holiday, after following a pack of hounds, huddle on his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) surplice, and gabble over the service with the most indecent mockery of religion. Do I speak with acrimony? I have reason. It was this chaplain who first led my lord to Newmarket; it was he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) who first taught my lord to drink. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) was a wit -- an insufferable wit. His (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) conversation after he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) had drank was such as no woman but Harriot Freke could understand, and such as few gentlemen could hear. I have never, alas! been thought a prude, but in the heyday of my youth and gaiety, this man always disgusted me. In one word, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was a buck parson. I hope you have as great a horror for this species of animal as I have?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Full as great,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dr</b></font>)</div>replied Dr X--; `but I consider them as monsters, which belonging to no species, can disgrace none.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They ought to be hunted by common consent out of civilized society,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>said Lady Delacour.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They are by public opinion banished from all rational society; and your ladyship's just indignation proves, that they have no chance of being tolerated by fashion. But would it not allow such beings too much consequence, would it not extend their power to do mischief, if we perceived that one such person could disgust Lady Delacour with the whole race of chaplains?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is uncommon,''  (<font color='red'><b>ladyship</b></font>)</div>replied her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) ladyship, `to hear a physician earnest in the defence of the clergy -- and a literary philosophic physician too! Shall we have an eulogium upon bishops as well as chaplains?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We have had that already,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dr</b></font>)</div>replied Dr X--. <div class="bookquote">``All ranks, persuasions, and descriptions of people, including, I hope, those stigmatized by the name of philosophers, have joined in admiration of the bishop of St Pol de Leon. The conduct of the real martyrs to their faith amongst the French clergy, not even the most witty or brutal sceptic could ridicule.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You surprise me, doctor!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>said Lady Delacour; `for I assure you that you have the character of being very liberal in your opinions.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope I am liberal in my opinions,''  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>replied the doctor, `and that I give your ladyship a proof of it.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You would not then persecute a man or woman with ridicule for believing more than you do?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>said Lady Delacour.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Those who persecute, to overturn religion, can scarcely pretend to more philosophy, or more liberality, than those who persecute to support it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dr</b></font>)</div>said Dr X--.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps, doctor, you are only speaking popularly?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I believe what I now say to be true,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dr</b></font>)</div>said Dr X--, ' and I always endeavour to make truth popular.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But possibly these are only truths for ladies. Doctor X-- may be such an ungallant philosopher, as to think that some truths are not fit for ladies. He (<font color='blue'><b>philosopher</b></font>) may hold a different language with gentlemen.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should not only be an ungallant but a weak philosopher,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dr</b></font>)</div>said Dr X--, `if I thought that truth was not the same for all the world who can understand it. And who can doubt Lady Delacour's being of that number?''

<p/>Lady Delacour, who, at the beginning of this conversation, had spoken guardedly, from the fear of lowering the doctor's opinion of her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) understanding, was put at her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) ease by the manner in which he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) now spoke; and, half laying aside the tone of raillery, she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) said to him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``Well, doctor! seriously, I am not so illiberal as to condemn all chaplains for one, odious as he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) was. But where to find his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) contrast in these degenerate days? Can you, who are a defender of the faith, and so forth, assist me? Will you recommend a chaplain to my lord?''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Willingly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dr</b></font>)</div>said Dr X--; `and that is what I would not say for a world of fees, unless I were sure of my man.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What sort of a man is he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not a buck parson.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And I hope not a pedant, not a dogmatist, for that would be almost as bad. Before we domesticate another chaplain, I wish to know all his (<font color='blue'><b>chaplain</b></font>) qualities, and to have a full and true description of him (<font color='blue'><b>chaplain</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Shall I then give you a full and true description of him (<font color='blue'><b>chaplain</b></font>) in the words of Chaucer?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In any words you please. But Chaucer's chaplain must be a little old-fashioned by this time, I should think.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pardon me. Some people, as well as some things, never grow old-fashioned. I should not be ashamed to produce Chaucer's parish priest at this day to the best company in England -- I am not ashamed to produce him (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) to your ladyship; and if I can remember twenty lines in his (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) favour, I hope you will give me credit for being a sincere friend to the worthy part of the clergy. Observe, you must take them as I can patch them together; I will not promise that I can recollect twenty lines de suite, and without missing a word; that is what I would not swear to do for His (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) Grace the Archbishop of Canterbury.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``His (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) Grace will probably excuse you from swearing; at least I will,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>said Lady Delacour, `on the present occasion: so now for your twenty lines in whatever order you please.''

<p/>Doctor X--, with sundry intervals of recollection, which may be spared the reader, repeated the following lines:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yet has his (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) aspect nothing of severe
But such a face as promised him (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) sincere,
Nothing reserved or sullen was to see,
But sweet regards, and pleasing sanctity,
Mild was his (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) accent, and his (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) action free.
With eloquence innate his (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) tongue was arm'd,
Though harsh the precept, yet the preacher charm'd;
For, letting down the golden chain from high,
He (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) drew his (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) audience upwards to the sky.
He (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) taught the Gospel rather than the law,
And forced himself to drive, but loved to draw.
The tithes his (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) parish freely paid, he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) took;
But never sued, or curs'd with bell and book.
Wide was his (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) parish, not contracted close
In streets -- but here and there a straggling house.
Yet still he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) was at hand, without request,
To serve the sick, and succour the distressed.
The proud he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) tamed, the penitent he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) cheer'd,
Nor to rebuke the rich offender fear'd.
His (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) preaching much, but more his (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) practice wrought,
A living sermon of the truths he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) taught.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the reader</b></font>)</div>Lady Delacour wished that she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) could find a chaplain, who in any degree resembled this charming parish priest, and Dr X-- promised that he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) would the next day introduce to her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) friend Mr Moreton.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr Moreton!''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Belinda, `the gentleman of whom Mr Percival spoke, Mrs Freke's Mr Moreton?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dr</b></font>)</div>said Dr X--, `the clergyman whom Mrs Freke hanged in effigy, and to whom Clarence Hervey has given a small living.''

<p/>These circumstances, even if he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) had not precisely resembled Chaucer's character of a benevolent clergyman, would have strongly interested Lady Delacour in his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) favour. She (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) found him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>), upon farther acquaintance, a perfect contrast to her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) former chaplain; and he (<font color='blue'><b>chaplain</b></font>) gradually acquired such salutary influence over her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) mind, that he (<font color='blue'><b>chaplain</b></font>) relieved her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) from the terrors of methodism, and in their place substituted the consolations of mild and rational piety.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) conscience was now at peace; her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) spirits were real and equable, and never was her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) conversation so agreeable. Animated with the new feelings of returning health, and the new hopes of domestic happiness, she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) seemed desirous to impart her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) felicity to all around her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>), but chiefly to Belinda, who had the strongest claims upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) gratitude, and the warmest place in her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) affections. Belinda never made her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) friend feel the weight of any obligation, and consequently Lady Delacour's gratitude was a voluntary pleasure -- not an expected duty. Nothing could be more delightful to Miss Portman than thus to feel herself the object at once of esteem, affection, and respect; to see that she (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) had not only been the means of saving her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) friend's life, but that the influence she (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) had obtained over her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) mind was likely to be so permanently beneficial both to her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) and to her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) family.

<p/>Belinda did not take all the merit of this reformation to herself: she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) was most willing to share it, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) own imagination, not only with Dr X-- and Mr Moreton, but with poor Clarence Hervey. She (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) was pleased to observe that Lady Delacour never omitted any occasion of doing justice to his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) merit, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) for that generosity, which sometimes passed the bounds of justice in her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) eulogiums. But Belinda was careful to preserve her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) consistency, and to guard her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) heart from the dangerous effect of these enthusiastic praises; and as Lady Delacour was now sufficiently re-established in her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) health, she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) announced her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) intention of returning immediately to Oakly-park, according to her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) promise to Lady Anne Percival and to Mr Vincent.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>said Lady Delacour, `one week more is all I ask from you -- may not friendship ask such a sacrifice from love?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You expect, I know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Miss Portman, ingenuously, `that before the end of that time Mr Hervey will be here.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``True. And have you no friendship for him (<font color='blue'><b>Moreton</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>said Lady Delacour with an arch smile, `or is friendship for every man in the creation, one Augustus Vincent always excepted, prohibited by the statutes of Oakly-park?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``By the statutes of Oakly-park nothing is forbidden,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Belinda, `but what reason -- '

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Reason! Oh, I have done if you go to reason! You are invulnerable to the light shafts of wit, I know, when you are cased in this heavy armour of reason; Cupid himself may strain his (<font color='blue'><b>Cupid</b></font>) bow, and exhaust his (<font color='blue'><b>Cupid</b></font>) quiver upon you in vain. But have a care -- you cannot live in armour all your life -- lay it aside but for a moment, and the little bold urchin will make it his (<font color='blue'><b>Cupid</b></font>) prize. Remember, in one of Raphael's pictures, Cupid creeping into the armour of the conqueror of the world.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sufficiently aware,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Belinda, smiling, `of the power of Cupid, and of his (<font color='blue'><b>Cupid</b></font>) wiles. I would not brave his (<font color='blue'><b>Cupid</b></font>) malice, but I will fly from it.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is so cowardly to fly!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Surely prudence, not courage, is the virtue of our sex; and seriously, my dear Lady Delacour, I entreat you not to use your influence over my mind, lest you should lessen my happiness, though you cannot alter my determination.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div><p/>Moved by the earnest manner in which Belinda uttered these words, Lady Delacour rallied her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) no more, nor did she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) longer oppose her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) resolution of returning immediately to Oakly-park.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``May I remind you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Miss Portman, `though it is seldom either politic or polite, to remind people of their promises, -- but may I remind you of something like a promise you made, to accompany me to Mr Percival<div class="bookquote">``s?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr Percival</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And would you have me behave so brutally to poor Lord Delacour, as to run away from him (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) in this manner the moment I have strength to run?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Lord Delacour is included in this invitation,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Miss Portman, putting the last letter that she (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) had received from Lady Anne Percival into her (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) hands.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``When I recollect,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>said Lady Delacour, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) looked over the letter, `how well this Lady Anne of yours has behaved to me about Helena, when I recollect, that, though you have been with her (<font color='blue'><b>Helena</b></font>) so long, she (<font color='blue'><b>Helena</b></font>) has not supplanted me in your affections, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Helena</b></font>) did not attempt to detain you when I sent Marriott to Oakly-park, and when I consider how much for my own advantage it will be to accept this invitation, I really cannot bring myself, from pride, or folly, or any other motive, to refuse it. So, my dear Belinda, prevail upon Lord Delacour to spend his (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) Christmas at Oakly-park, instead of at Studley-manor -LRB-Rantipole, thank Heaven! is out of the question-RRB-, and prevail upon yourself to stay a few days for me, and you shall take us all with you in triumph.''

<p/>Belinda was convinced that, when Lady Delacour had once tasted the pleasures of domestic life, she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) would not easily return to that dissipation which she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) had followed from habit, and into which she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) had first been driven by a mixture of vanity and despair. All the connexions which she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) had imprudently formed with numbers of fashionable but extravagant and thoughtless women would insensibly be broken off by this measure; for Lady Delacour, who was already weary of their company, would be so much struck with the difference between their insipid conversation and the animated and interesting society in Lady Anne Percival's family, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) would afterwards think them not only burdensome but intolerable. Lord Delacour's intimacy with Lord Studley was one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) chief inducements to that intemperance, which injured almost equally his (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) constitution and his (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) understanding: for some weeks past he (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) had abstained from all excess, and Belinda was well aware, that, when the immediate motive of humanity to Lady Delacour ceased to act upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) would probably return to his (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) former habits, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) continued to visit his (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) former associates. It was therefore of importance to break at once his (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) connexion with Lord Studley, and to place him (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) in a situation where he (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) might form new habits, and where his (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) dormant talents might be roused to exertion. She (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) was convinced that his (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) understanding was not so much below par as she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) had once been taught to think it: she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) perceived, also, that since their reconciliation, Lady Delacour was anxious to make him (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) appear to advantage: whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) said any thing that was worth hearing, she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) looked at Belinda with triumph; and whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) happened to make a mistake in conversation, she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) either showed involuntary signs of uneasiness, or passed it off with that easy wit, by which she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) generally knew how `to make the worse appear the better reason.'' Miss Portman knew that Mr Percival possessed the happy talent of drawing out all the abilities of those with whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) conversed, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) did not value men merely for their erudition, science, or literature; he (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) was capable of estimating the potential as well as the actual range of the mind. Of his (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) generosity she (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) could not doubt, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) was persuaded that he (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) would take every possible means which good nature, joined to good sense, could suggest, to raise Lord Delacour in his (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) lady's esteem, and to make that union happy which was indissoluble. All these reflections passed with the utmost rapidity in Belinda's mind, and the result of them was, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) consented to wait Lady Delacour's leisure for her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) journey.

<p/>CHAPTER XXIV

<p/>Peu à peu

<p/>THINGS were in this situation, when one day Marriott made her (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) appearance at her (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) lady's toilette with a face which at once proclaimed that something had discomposed her (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>), and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) was impatient to be asked what it was.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is the matter, Marriott?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>said Lady Delacour; `for I know you want me to ask.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Want you to ask! Oh, dear, my lady, no! -- for I'm sure, it's a thing that goes quite against me to tell; for I thought, indeed, my lady, superiorly of the person in question; so much so, indeed, that I wished what I declare I should now be ashamed to mention, especially in the presence of Miss Portman, who deserves the best that this world can afford of every denomination. Well, ma'am, in one word,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>continued she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>), addressing herself to Belinda, <div class="bookquote">``I am extremely rejoiced that things are as they are, though I confess that was not always my wish or opinion, for which I beg Mr Vincent's pardon and yours; but I hope to be forgiven, since I'm now come entirely round to my Lady Anne Percival's way of thinking, which I learnt from good authority at Oakly-park; and I am now convinced and confident, Miss Portman, that every thing is for the best.''

<p/>``Dear me! I'm sure I thought we had got rid of all double-dealers, when the house was cleared of Mr Champfort; but, oh, mercy! there's not traps enough in the world for them all; I only wish they were all caught as finely as some people were. <div class="bookquote">``Tis what all double-dealers, and Champfort at the head of the whole regiment, deserve -- that's certain.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We must take patience, my dear Belinda,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>said Lady Delacour, calmly, 'till Marriott has exhausted all the expletives in and out of the English language; and presently, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) has fought all her (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) battles with Champfort over again, we may hope to get at the fact.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear! my lady, it has nothing to do with Mr Champfort, nor any such style of personage, I can assure you; for, I'm positive, I'd rather think contemptibly of a hundred million Mr Champforts than of one such gentleman as Mr Clarence Hervey.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Clarence Hervey!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Lady Delacour: taking it for granted that Belinda blushed, her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) ladyship, with superfluous address, instantly turned, so as to hide her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) friend's face from Mrs Marriott. <div class="bookquote">``Well, Marriott, what of Mr Hervey?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, my lady, something you'll be surprised to hear, and Miss Portman, too. It is not, by any means, that I am more of a prude than is becoming, my lady: nor that I take upon me to be so innocent as not to know that young gentlemen of fortune will, if it be only for fashion's sake, have such things as kept mistresses -LRB-begging pardon for mentioning such trash-RRB-; but no one that has lived in the world thinks any thing of that, except,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>added she (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>), catching a glimpse of Belinda's countenance, `except, to be sure, ma'am, morally speaking, it's very wicked and shocking, and makes one blush before company, till one's used to it, and ought certainly to be put down by act of parliament, ma'am; but, my lady, you know, in point of surprising any body, or being discreditable in a young gentleman of Mr Hervey's fortune and pretensions, it would be mere envy and scandal to deem it any thing -- worth mentioning.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then, for mercy's sake, or mine,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>said Lady Delacour, `go on to something that is worth mentioning.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, my lady, you must know, then, that yesterday I wanted some hempseed for my bullfinch -- Miss Helena's bullfinch, I mean; for it was she (<font color='blue'><b>Helena</b></font>) found it by accident, you know, Miss Portman, the day after we came here. Poor thing! it got itself so entangled in the net over the morello cherry tree, in the garden, that it could neither get itself in nor out; but very luckily Miss Helena saw it, and saved, and brought it in: it was almost dead, my lady.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Was it? -- I mean I am very sorry for it: that is what you expect me to say. Now, go on -- get us once past the bullfinch, or tell us what it has to do with Clarence Hervey.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``That is what I am aiming at, as fast as possible, my lady. So I sent for some hempseed for the bullfinch, and along with the hempseed they brought me wrapped round it, as it were, a printed handbill, as it might be, or advertisement, which I threw off, disregardingly, taking for granted it might have been some of those advertisements for lozenges or razor-strops, that meet one wherever one goes; but Miss Delacour picked it up, and found it was a kind of hue and cry after a stolen or strayed bullfinch. Ma'am, I was so provoked, I could have cried, when I learnt it was the exact description of our little Bobby to a feather -- gray upon the back, and red on -- '

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! spare me the description to a feather. Well, you took the bird, bullfinch, or Bobby, as you call it, home to its rightful owner, I presume? Let me get you so far on your way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I beg your pardon, my lady, that is not the thing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then you did not take the bird home to its owner -- and you are a bird-stealer? With all my heart: be a dog-stealer, if you will -- only go on.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But, my lady, you hurry me so, it puts every thing topsy-turvy in my head; I could tell it as fast as possible my own way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do so, then.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I was ready to cry, when I found our little Bobby was claimed from us, to be sure; but Miss Delacour observed, that those with whom it had lived till it was grey must be sorrier still to part with it: so I resolved to do the honest and genteel thing by the lady who advertised for it, and to take it back myself, and to refuse the five guineas reward offered. The lady's name, according to the advertisement, was Ormond.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ormond!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>repeated Lady Delacour, looking eagerly at Belinda: `was not that the name Sir Philip Baddely mentioned to us -- you remember?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Ormond was the name, as well as I recollect,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Belinda, with a degree of steady composure that provoked her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) ladyship. <div class="bookquote">``Go on, Marriott.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``And the words were, to leave the bird at a perfumer's in Twickenham, opposite to -- ; but that's no matter. Well, my lady, to the perfumer's I went with the bird, this morning. Now, I had my reasons for wishing to see this Mrs Ormond myself, because, my lady, there was one thing rather remarkable about this bullfinch, that it sings a very particular tune, which I never heard any bullfinch, or any human creature, sing anything like before: so I determined, in my own cogitations, to ask this Mrs Ormond to name the tunes her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) bullfinch could sing, before I produced it; and if she (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) made no mention of its knowing any one out of the common way, I resolved to keep my bird to myself, as I might very conscientiously and genteelly too. So, my lady, when I got to the perfumer's, I inquired where Mrs Ormond was to be found? I was told that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) received no visits from any, at least from the female sex; and that I must leave the bird there till called for. I was considering what to do, and the strangeness of the information made about the female sex, when in there came, into the shop, a gentleman, who saved me all the indelicacy of asking particulars. The bullfinch was at this time piping away at a fine rate, and, as luck would have it, that very remarkable strange tune that I mentioned to you. Says the gentleman, as he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) came into the shop, fixing his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) eyes on the bullfinch as if they would have come fairly out of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) head, ``How did that bird come here?'' -- ``I brought it here, sir,'' said I. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Baddely</b></font>) began to offer me mountains of gold in a very strange way, if I could tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Baddely</b></font>) any tidings of the lady to whom it belonged. The shopman from behind the counter now bent forward, and whispered the gentleman that he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) could give him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) some information, if he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) would make it worth his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) while; and they both went together to a little parlour behind the shop, and I saw no more of them. But, my lady, very opportunely for me, that was dying with curiosity, out of the parlour they turned a young woman in, to attend the shop, who proved to be an acquaintance of mine, whom I had done some little favours to when in service in London. And this young woman, when I told her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) my distress about the advertisement and the bullfinch, let me into the whole of the affair. ``Ma'am,'' said she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), ``all that is known about Mrs Ormond, in this house, or any where else, is from me; so there was no occasion for turning me out of the parlour. I lived with Mrs Ormond, ma'am,'' says she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), ``for half a year, in the very house she (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) now occupies, and consequently nobody can be better informed than I am:'' -- to which I agreed. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) told me that the reason that Mrs Ormond never saw any company of any sort was, because she (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) is not fit to see company -- proper company -- for she (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>)'s not a proper woman. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) has a most beautiful young creature there, shut up, who has been seduced, and is now deserted in a most cruel manner by a Mr Hervey. Oh, my lady! how the name struck upon my ear! I hoped, however, it was not our Mr Hervey; but it was the identical Mr Clarence Hervey. I made the young woman describe him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>), for she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had often and often see him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>), when he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) visited the unfortunate creature; and the description could suit none but our Mr Hervey, and besides it put it beyond a doubt, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) told me his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) linen was all marked C.H.. So our Mr Hervey, ma``am,<div class="bookquote">'' added Marriott, turning to Belinda, `it certainly proved to be, to my utter dismay and confusion.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Marriott! my poor head!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Lady Delacour, starting from under her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) hands: `that cruel comb went at least half an inch into my head -- heads have feeling as well as hearts, believe me.'' And, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) spoke, she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) snatched out the comb with which Marriott had just fastened up her (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) hair, and flung it on a sofa at some yards' distance. While Marriott went to fetch it, Lady Delacour thought that Belinda would have time to recover from that utter dismay and confusion into which she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) hoped that she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) must now be thrown. <div class="bookquote">``Come, Marriott, make haste. I have done you at least a great favour, for you have all this hair to perform upon again, and you will have leisure to finish this story of yours -- which, at all events, if it is not in any other respect wonderful, we must allow is wonderfully long.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, my lady, to be short, then -- I was more curious than ever, when I heard all this, to hear more; and asked my friend how she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) could ever think of staying in a house with ladies of such a description! Upon which she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) justified herself by assuring me, upon her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) honour, that at first she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) believed the young lady was married privately to Mr Hervey, for that a clergyman came in secret, and read prayers, and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) verily believes that the unfortunate young creature was deceived barbarously, and made to fancy herself married to all intents and purposes, till all at once Mr Hervey threw off the mask, and left off visiting her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), pretending a necessity to take a journey, and handing her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) over to that vile woman, that Mrs Ormond, who bid her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) to be comforted, and all the things that are said by such women, on such occasions, by all accounts. But the poor deluded young thing saw how it was now too plain, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) was ready to break her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) heart, but not in a violent, common sort of way, ma'am, but in silent grief, pining and drooping. My friend could not stand the sight, nor endure to look upon Mrs Ormond now she (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) knew what she (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) was; and so she (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) left the house, without giving any reason, immediately. I forgot to mention, that the unfortunate girl's maiden name was St Pierre, my lady: but her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) christian name, which was rather an out o' the way name, I quite forget.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No matter,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>said Lady Delacour, `we can live without it; or we can imagine it.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``To be sure -- I beg pardon; such sort of people's names can't be of any consequence, and, I'm sure, I blame myself now for going to the house, after all I had heard.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You did go to the house, then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To my shame be it spoken; my curiosity got the better of me, and I went -- but only on account of the bullfinch in the eyes of the world. It was a great while before I could get in: but I was so firm, that I would not give up the bird to no one but the lady herself, that I got in at last. Oh, never did my eyes light upon so beautiful a creature, nor so graceful, nor so innocent to look at!''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>-- Belinda sighed -- Marriott echoed the sigh, and continued: <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was by herself, and in tears, when I was shown in, ma'am, and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) started as if she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had never seen any body before in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) life. But when she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) saw the bullfinch, ma'am, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) clapped her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) hands, and, smiling through her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) tears like a child, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) ran up to me, and thanked me again and again, kissing the bird between times, and putting it into her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) bosom. Well, I declare, if she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had talked to all eternity, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) could never have made me pity her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) half so much as all this did, for it looked so much like innocence. I'm sure, nobody that was not -- or, at least, that did not think themselves innocent, could have such ways, and such an innocent affection for a little bird. Not but what I know ladies of a certain description often have birds, but then their fondness is all affectation and fashion; but this poor thing was all nature. Ah! poor unfortunate girl, thought I -- but it's no matter what I thought now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marriott/Mrs Marriott</b></font>)</div>said Marriott, shutting her (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) eyes, to hide the tears that came into them at this instant; ``I was ashamed of myself, when I saw Mrs Ormond just then come into the room, which made me recollect what sort of company I was in. La! my lady, how I detested the sight of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)! She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) looked at me, too, more like a dragon than any thing else; though in a civil way, and as if she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was frightened out of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) wits, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) asked Miss St Pierre, as she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) called her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), how I had got in -LRB-in a whisper-RRB- and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) made all sorts of signs afterward to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), to go out of the room. Never having been in such a situation before, I was quite robbed of all fluency, and could not -- what with the anger I felt for the one, and sorrow for the other -- get out a word of common sense, or even recollect what pretense brought me into the room, till the bird very luckily put it into my head by beginning to sing; so than I asked, whether they could certify it to be theirs by any particular tune of its own! <div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Miss St Pierre; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) sung the very same tune. I never heard so sweet a voice; but, poor thing, something came across her (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) mind in the middle of it, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) stopped; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) thanked me again for bringing back the bird, which, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) said, had been hers for a great many years, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) loved it dearly. I stood, I believe, like one stupefied, till I was roused by the woman's offering to put the five guineas reward, mentioned in the advertisement, into my hand. The touch of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) gold made me start, as if it had been a snake, and I pushed it from me, and when she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) pressed it again, I threw it on the table, scarce knowing what I did; and just then, in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) iniquitous hand, I saw a letter, directed to Clarence Hervey, Esq.. Oh, how I hated the sight of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) name, and every thing belonging to him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>), ma'am, at that minute! I'm sure, I could not have kept myself from saying something quite outrageous, if I had not taken myself out of the house, as I did, that instant.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``When there are women enough born and bred good for nothing, and ladies enough to flirt with, that would desire no better, that a gentleman like Mr Clarence Hervey, ma'am, should set his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) wits, as one may say, to be the ruin of such a sweet, innocent-looking young creature, and then desert her (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) in that barbarous way, after bringing a clergyman to deceive her (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) with a mock ceremony, and all -- oh! there is no fashion, nor nothing can countenance such wickedness! `tis the worst of wickedness and cruelty -- and I shall think and say so to the latest hour of my life.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well said, Marriott,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>cried Lady Delacour.

<p/>``And now you know the reason, ma``am,<div class="bookquote">'' added Marriott, `that I said, I was glad things are as they are. To be sure I and every body once thought -- but that's all over now -- and I am glad things are as they are.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div><p/>Lady Delacour once more turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) quick eyes upon Belinda, and was much pleased to see that she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) seemed to sympathize with Marriott's indignation.

<p/>In the evening, when they were alone, Lady Delacour touched upon the subject again, and observed, that as they should now, in all probability, see Mr Hervey in a few days, they might be able to form a better judgment of this affair, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) doubted not had been exaggerated. <div class="bookquote">``You should judge from the whole of Clarence's conduct and character and not from any particular part,''  (<font color='red'><b>ladyship</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) ladyship. <div class="bookquote">``Do not his (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) letters breathe a spirit of generosity?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>interrupted Miss Portman, ``I am not called upon to judge of Mr Hervey's whole conduct and character, nor of any part of it; his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) letters and his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) generosity are nothing -- '

<p/><div class="bookquote">``To you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Lady Delacour with a smile.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This is no time, and no subject for raillery, my dear friend,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Belinda; `you assured me, and I believed you, that the idea of Mr Hervey's return was entirely out of the question, when you prevailed upon me to delay my journey to Oakly-park. As I now understand that your ladyship has changed your mind, I must request your ladyship will permit me -- '

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I will permit you to do what you please, dearest Belinda, except to call me your ladyship twice in one sentence. You shall go to Oakly-park the day after to-morrow: will that content you, my dear? I admire your strength of mind -- you are much fitter to conduct yourself than I am to conduct you. I have done with raillery: my first, my only object, is your happiness. I respect and esteem as much as I love you, and I love you better than any thing upon earth -- power excepted, you will say -- power not excepted, believe me; and if you are one of those strange people that cannot believe without proof, you shall have proof positive upon the spot,''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>added she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>), ringing the bell as she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) spoke. <div class="bookquote">``I will no longer contend for power over your mind with your friends at Oakly-park. I will give orders, in your presence, to Marriott, to prepare for our march -- I did not call it retreat; but there is nothing shows so much generalship as a good retreat, unless it be a great victory. I am, I confess, rather prejudiced in favour of victory.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So am I,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Belinda, with a smile. <div class="bookquote">``I am so strongly prejudiced in favour of victory, that rather than obtain no other, I would even be content with a victory over myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div><p/>Scarcely had Belinda pronounced these words, when Lord Delacour, who had dined in town, entered the room, accompanied by Mr Vincent.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Give me leave, Lady Delacour, to introduce to you,''  (<font color='red'><b>lordship gentleman</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) lordship, 'a young gentleman, who has a great, and, I am sure, a most disinterested desire to cultivate your ladyship's further acquaintance.''

<p/>Lady Delacour received him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) with all the politeness imaginable; and even her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) prepossessions in favour of Clarence Hervey could not prevent her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) from being struck with his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) appearance. Il a infiniment l'air d'un héros de roman, thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>), and Belinda is not quite so great a philosopher as I imagined. In due time her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) ladyship recollected that she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) had orders to give to Marriott about her (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) journey, that made it absolutely necessary she (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) should leave Miss Portman to entertain Mr Vincent, if possible, without her (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>), for a few minutes; and Lord Delacour departed, contenting himself with the usual excuse of -- letters to write.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I ought to be delighted with your gallantry, Mr Vincent,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Belinda, `in travelling so many miles, to remind me of my promise about Oakly-park; but on the contrary, I am sorry you have taken so much unnecessary trouble: Lady Delacour is, at this instant, preparing for our journey to Mr Percival's. We intend to set out the day after to-morrow.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am heartily glad of it -- I shall be infinitely overpaid for my journey, by having the pleasure of going back with you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>subjects</b></font>)</div><p/>After some conversation upon different subjects, Mr Vincent, with an air of frankness which was peculiarly pleasing to Belinda, put into her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) hands an anonymous letter, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) had received the preceding day.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is not worth your reading,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>); `but I know you too well to fear that it should give you any pain; and I hope you know me too well, to apprehend that it could make any impression on my mind.''

<p/>Belinda read with some surprise: --

<p/>``Rash young man! beware of connecting yourself with the lady to whom you have lately been drawn in to pay your addresses: she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) is the most artful of women. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) has been educated, as you may find upon inquiry, by one, whose successful trade it has been to draw in young men of fortune for her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) nieces, whence she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) has obtained the appellation of the match-maker general. The only niece whom she (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) could not get rid of any other way, she (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) sent to the most dissipated and unprincipled viscountess in town. The viscountess fell sick, and, as it was universally reported last winter, the young lady was immediately, upon her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) friend's death, to have been married to the viscount widower. But the viscountess detected the connexion, and the young lady, to escape from her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) friend's rage, and from public shame, was obliged to retreat to certain shades in the neighbourhood of Harrowgate; where she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) passed herself for a saint upon those who were too honourable themselves to be suspicious of others.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``At length the quarrel between her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) and the viscountess was made up, by her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) address and boldness in declaring, that if she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was not recalled, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) would divulge some secrets respecting a certain mysterious boudoir in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) ladyship's house: this threat terrified the viscountess, who sent off express for her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) late discarded humble companion. The quarrel was hushed up, and the young lady is now with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) noble friend at Twickenham. The person who used to be let up the private stairs into the boudoir, by Mrs Marriott, is now more conveniently received at Twickenham.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the letter-writer</b></font>)</div><p/>Much more was said by the letter-writer in the same strain. The name of Clarence Hervey, in the last page, caught Belinda's eye; and with a trepidation, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) did not feel at the beginning of this epistle, she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) read the conclusion.

<p/>``The viscount is not supposed to have been unrivalled in the young lady's favour. A young gentleman, of large fortune, great talents, and uncommon powers of pleasing, has, for some months, been her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) secret object; but he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) has been prudent enough to escape her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) matrimonial snares, though he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) carries on a correspondence with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), through the means of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) friend the viscountess, to whom he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) privately writes. The noble lady has bargained to make over to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) confidante all her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) interest in Hervey's heart. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) is expected every day to return from his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) tour; and, if the schemes upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) can be brought to bear, the promised return to the neighbourhood of Harrowgate will never be thought of. Mr Vincent will be left in the lurch, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) will not even have the lady's fair hand -- her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) fair heart is Clarence Hervey's, at all events. Further particulars shall be communicated to Mr Vincent, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) pays due attention to this warning from

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A SINCERE FRIEND.''


 (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div><p/>As soon as Belinda had finished this curious production, she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) thanked Mr Vincent, with more kindness than she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) had ever before shown him (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>), for the confidence he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) placed in her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>), and for the openness with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) treated her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) begged his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) permission to show this letter to Lady Delacour, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) had previously dreaded the effect which it might have upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) ladyship's feelings.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) first exclamation was, ``This is one of Harriot Freke's frolics;' but as her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) ladyship's indignation against Mrs Freke had long since subsided into utter contempt, she (<font color='blue'><b>Freke</b></font>) did not waste another thought upon the writer of this horrible letter; but instantly the whole energy of her (<font color='blue'><b>Freke</b></font>) mind and fire of her (<font color='blue'><b>Freke</b></font>) eloquence burst forth in an eulogium upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Freke</b></font>) friend. Careless of all that concerned herself, she (<font color='blue'><b>Freke</b></font>) explained, without a moment's hesitation, every thing that could exalt Belinda: she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) described all the difficult circumstances in which her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) friend had been placed; she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) mentioned the secret with which she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) had been intrusted; the honour with which, even at the hazard of her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) own reputation, she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) had kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) promise of secrecy inviolable, when Lord Delacour, in a fit of intoxication and jealousy, had endeavoured to wrest from Marriott the key of the mysterious boudoir. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) confessed her (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) own absurd jealousy, explained how it had been excited by the artifices of Champfort and Sir Philip Baddely, how slight circumstances had worked her (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) mind up almost to frenzy. ``The temper, the dignity, the gentleness, the humanity, with which Belinda bore with me, during this paroxysm of madness,'' said Lady Delacour, <div class="bookquote">``I never can forget; nor the spirit with which she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) left my house, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) saw me unworthy of her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) esteem, and ungrateful for her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) kindness; nor the magnanimity with which she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) returned to me, when I thought myself upon my death-bed: all this has made an impression upon my soul, which never, whilst I have life and reason, can be effaced. She (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) has saved my life. She (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) has made my life worth saving. She (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) has made me feel my own value. She (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) has made me know my own happiness. She (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) has reconciled me to my husband. She (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) has united me with my child. She (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) has been my guardian angel. -- She (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>), the confidante of my intrigues! -- she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) leagued with me in vice! -- No, I am bound to her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) by ties stronger than vice ever felt; than vice, even in the utmost ingenuity of its depravity, can devise.''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>Exhausted by the vehemence with which she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) had spoken, Lady Delacour paused; but Vincent, who sympathized in her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) enthusiasm, kept his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) eyes fixed upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>), in hopes that she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) had yet more to say.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I might, perhaps, you will think,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>continued she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>), smiling, `have spared you this history of myself, and of my own affairs, Mr Vincent; but I thought it necessary to tell you the plain facts, which malice has distorted into the most odious form. This is the quarrel, this is the reconciliation, of which your anonymous friend has been so well informed. Now, as to Clarence Hervey.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have explained to Mr Vincent,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>interrupted Belinda, `every thing that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) could wish to know on that subject, and I now wish you to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) that I faithfully remembered my promise to return to Oakly-park, and that we were actually preparing for the journey.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Look here, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>cried Lady Delacour, opening the door of her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) dressing-room, in which Marriott was upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) knees, locking a trunk, `here's dreadful note of preparation.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are a happier man than you yet know, Mr Vincent,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>continued Lady Delacour; `for I can tell you, that some persuasion, some raillery, and some wit, I flatter myself, have been used, to detain Miss Portman from you.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``From Oakly-park,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>interrupted Belinda.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``From Oakly-park, &c. a few days longer. Shall I be frank with you, Mr Vincent? -- Yes, for I cannot help it -- I am not of the nature of anonymous letter-writers; I cannot, either secretly or publicly, sign or say myself a sincere friend, without being one to the utmost extent of my influence. I never give my vote without my interest, nor my interest without my vote. Now Clarence Hervey is my friend. Start not at all, sir, -- you have no reason; for if he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) is my friend, Miss Portman is yours: which has the better bargain? But, as I was going to tell you, Mr Clarence Hervey is my friend, and I am his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>). My vote, interest, and influence, have consequently been all in his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) favour. I had reason to believe that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) has long admired the dignity of Miss Portman's mind, and the simplicity of her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) character,''  (<font color='red'><b>ladyship</b></font>)</div>continued her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) ladyship, with an arch look at Belinda; `and though he (<font color='blue'><b>myself</b></font>) was too much a man of genius to begin with the present tense of the indicative mood, <div class="bookquote">``I love,''  (<font color='red'><b>genius</b></font>)</div>yet I was, and am, convinced, that he (<font color='blue'><b>myself</b></font>) does love her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>).''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Can you, dear Lady Delacour,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>cried Belinda, `speak on this manner, and recollect all we heard from Marriott this morning? And to what purpose all this?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``To what purpose, my dear? To convince your friend, Mr Vincent, that I am neither fool nor knave; but that I deal fairly by you, by him (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>), and by all the world. Mr Hervey's conduct towards Miss Portman has, I acknowledge, sir, been undecided. Some circumstances have lately come to my knowledge which throw doubts upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) honour and integrity -- doubts which, I firmly believe, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) will clear up to my satisfaction at least, as soon as I see him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>), or as soon as it is in his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) power; with this conviction, and believing, as I do, that no man upon earth is so well suited to my friend, -- pardon me, Mr Vincent, if my wishes differ from yours: though my sincerity may give you present, it may save you from future, pain.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Your ladyship's sincerity, whatever pain it may give me, I admire,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr Vincent/Vincent</b></font>)</div>said Mr Vincent, with some pride in his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) manner; `but I see that I must despair of the honour of your ladyship's congratulations.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Pardon me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>interrupted Lady Delacour; `there you are quite mistaken: the man of Belinda's choice must receive my congratulations; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) must do more -- he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) must become my friend. I would never rest till I had won his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) regard, nor should I in the least be apprehensive that he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) would not have sufficient greatness of mind to forgive my having treated him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) with a degree of sincerity which the common forms of politeness cannot justify, and at which common souls would be scandalized past recovery.''

<p/>Mr Vincent's pride was entirely vanquished by this speech; and with that frankness by which his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) manners were usually characterized he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) thanked her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) for having distinguished him (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) from common souls; and assured her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) that such sincerity as hers was infinitely more to his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) taste than that refined politeness of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) was aware no one was more perfect mistress than Lady Delacour.

<p/>Here their conversation ended, and Mr Vincent, as it was now late, took his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) leave.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Really, my dear Belinda,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>said Lady Delacour, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) was gone, <div class="bookquote">``I am not surprised at your impatience to return to Oakly-park; I am not so partial to my knight, as to compare him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>), in personal accomplishments, with your hero. I acknowledge, also, that there is something vastly prepossessing in the frankness of his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) manners; he (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) has behaved admirably well about this abominable letter; but, what is better than all in a lady's eyes, he (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) is éperdument amoureux.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not éperdument, I hope,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Belinda.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then, as you do not think it necessary for your hero to be éperdument amoureux, I presume,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>said Lady Delacour, `you do not think it necessary that a heroine should be in love at all. So love and marriage are to be separated by philosophy, as well as by fashion. This is Lady Anne Percival's doctrine! I give Mr Percival joy. I remember the time, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) fancied love essential to happiness.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I believe he (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) not only fancies, but is sure of it now, from experience,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Belinda.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then he (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) interdicts love only to his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) friends? He (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) does not think it essential that you should know any thing about the matter. You may marry his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) ward, and welcome, without being in love with him (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But not without loving him (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Belinda.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not casuist enough in these matters to understand the subtle distinction you make, with the true Percival emphasis, between loving and falling in love. But I suppose I am to understand by loving, loving as half the world do when they marry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``As it would be happy for half the world if they did,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>replied Belinda, mildly, but with a firmness of tone that her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) ladyship felt. <div class="bookquote">``I should despise myself and deserve no pity from any human being, if, after all I have seen, I could think of marrying for convenience or interest.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! pardon me; I meant not to insinuate such an idea; even your worst enemy, Sir Philip Baddely, would acquit you there. I meant but to hint, my dear Belinda, that a heart such as yours is formed for love in its highest, purest, happiest state.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>A pause ensued.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Such happiness can be secured only,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>resumed Belinda, `by a union with a man of sense and virtue.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A man of sense and virtue, I suppose, means Mr Vincent,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>said Lady Delacour: `no doubt you have lately learned in the same sober style that a little love will suffice with a great deal of esteem.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope I have learned lately that a great deal of esteem is the best foundation for a great deal of love.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Possibly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>said Lady Delacour; `but we often see people working at the foundation all their lives without getting any farther.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And those who build their castles of happiness in the sky,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Belinda, `are they more secure, wiser, or happier?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Wiser! I know nothing about that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>said Lady Delacour; `but happier I do believe they are; for the castle-building is always a labour of love, but the foundations of drudgery are generally love's labour lost. Poor Vincent will find it so.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps not,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Belinda; `for already his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) solid good qualities -- '

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Solid good qualities!''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>interrupted Lady Delacour. <div class="bookquote">``I beg your pardon for interrupting you, but, my dear, you know we never fall in love with good qualities, except, indeed, when they are joined to an aquiline nose -- oh! that aquiline nose of Mr Vincent's! I am more afraid of it than of all his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) solid good qualities. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) has again, I acknowledge it, much the advantage of Clarence Hervey in personal accomplishments. But you are not a woman to be decided by personal accomplishments.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you will not allow me to be decided by solid good qualities,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Belinda. <div class="bookquote">``So by what must I be determined?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``By your heart, my dear; by your heart: trust your heart only.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Alas!''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Belinda, `how many, many women have deplored their having trusted to their hearts only.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Their hearts! but I said your heart: mind your pronouns, my dear, that makes all the difference. But, to be serious, tell me, do you really and bona fide, as my old uncle the lawyer used to say, love Mr Vincent?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Belinda, <div class="bookquote">``I do not love him (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) yet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But for that emphatic yet, how I should have worshipped you! I wish I could once clearly understand the state of your mind about Mr Vincent, and then I should be able to judge how far I might indulge myself in raillery without being absolutely impertinent. So without intruding upon your confidence, tell me whatever you please.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will tell you all I know of my own mind,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>replied Belinda, looking up with an ingenuous countenance. <div class="bookquote">``I esteem Mr Vincent; I am grateful to him (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) for the proofs he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) has given me of steady attachment, and of confidence in my integrity. I like his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) manners and the frankness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) temper; but I do not yet love him (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>), and till I do, no earthly consideration could prevail upon me to marry him (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perfectly satisfactory, my dear Belinda; and yet I cannot be quite at ease whilst Mr Vincent is present, and my poor Clarence absent: proximity is such a dangerous advantage even with the wisest of us. The absent lose favour so quickly in Cupid's court, as in all other courts; and they are such victims to false reports and vile slanderers!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div><p/>Belinda sighed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you for that sigh, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>said Lady Delacour. <div class="bookquote">``May I ask, would you, if you discovered that Mr Vincent had a Virginia, discard him (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) for ever from your thoughts?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If I discovered that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) had deceived and behaved dishonourably to any woman, I certainly should banish him (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) for ever from my regard.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``With as much ease as you banished Clarence Hervey?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``With more, perhaps.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then you acknowledge -- that's all I want -- that you liked Clarence better than you do Vincent?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I acknowledge it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Belinda, colouring up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) temples; `but that time is entirely past, and I never look back to it.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But if you were forced to look back to it, my dear, and Clarence Hervey proposed for you, -- would not you cast a lingering look behind?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Let me beg of you, my dear Lady Delacour, as my friend,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>cried Belinda, speaking and looking with great earnestness, `let me beg of you to forbear. Do not use your powerful influence over my heart to make me think of what I ought not to think, or do what I ought not to do. I have permitted Mr Vincent to address me. You cannot imagine that I am so base as to treat him (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) with duplicity, or that I consider him (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) only as a pis-aller, no -- I have treated, I will treat him (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) honourably. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) knows exactly the state of my mind. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) shall have a fair trial whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) can win my love; the moment I am convinced that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) cannot succeed, I will tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) so decidedly: but if ever I should feel for him (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) that affection which is necessary for my happiness and his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>), I hope I shall without fear, even of Lady Delacour's ridicule or displeasure, avow my sentiments, and abide by my choice.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear, I admire you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>said Lady Delacour, `but I am incorrigible; I am not fit to hear myself convinced. After all, I am impelled by the genius of imprudence to tell you, that, in spite of Mr Percival's cure for first loves, I consider love as a distemper that can be had but once.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``As you acknowledge that you are not fit to hear yourself convinced,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Belinda, <div class="bookquote">``I will not argue this point with you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you will allow,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>said Lady Delacour, `as it is said or sung in Cupid's calendar, that --

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Un peu d'amour, un peu de soin,
Menent souvent un coeur bien loin;'' (<font color='red'><b>Cupid</b></font>)</div>'
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) broke off the conversation by singing that beautiful French air.
CHAPTER XXV

<p/>Love me, love my dog

<p/>THE only interest that honest people can take in the fate of rogues is in their detection and punishment; the reader, then, will be so far interested in the fate of Mr Champfort, as to feel some satisfaction at his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr</b></font>) being safely lodged in Newgate. The circumstance which led to this desirable catastrophe was the anonymous letter to Mr Vincent. From the first moment that Marriott saw or heard of the letter, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) was convinced, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) said, that <div class="bookquote">``Mr Champfort was at the bottom of it.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Lady Delacour was equally convinced that Harriot Freke was the author of the epistle; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) supported her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) opinion by observing, that Champfort could neither write nor spell English. Marriott and her (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) lady were both right. It was a joint, or rather a triplicate performance. Champfort, in conjunction with the stupid maid, furnished the intelligence, which Mrs Freke manufactured; and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>) had put the whole into proper style and form, Mr Champfort got her (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>) rough draught fairly copied at his (<font color='blue'><b>Champfort</b></font>) leisure, and transmitted his (<font color='blue'><b>Champfort</b></font>) copy to Mr Vincent. Now all this was discovered by a very slight circumstance. The letter was copied by Mr Champfort upon a sheet of mourning paper, off which he (<font color='blue'><b>Champfort</b></font>) thought that he (<font color='blue'><b>Champfort</b></font>) had carefully cut the edges; but one bit of the black edge remained, which did not escape Marriott's scrutinizing eye. <div class="bookquote">``Lord bless my stars! my lady,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) exclaimed, `this must be the paper -- I mean may be the paper -- that Mr Champfort was cutting a quire of, the very day before Miss Portman left town. It's a great while ago, but I remember it as well as if it was yesterday. I saw a parcel of black jags of paper littering the place, and asked what had been going on? and was told, that it was only Mr Champfort who had been cutting some paper; which, to be sure, I concluded my lord had given to him (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>), having no further occasion for, -- as my lord and you, my lady, were just going out of mourning at that time, as you may remember.''

<p/>Lord Delacour, when the paper was shown to him (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>), recognized it immediately by a private mark which he (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) had put on the outside sheet of a division of letter paper, which, indeed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) had never given to Champfort, but which he (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) had missed about the time Marriott mentioned. Between the leaves of this paper his (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) lordship had put, as it was often his (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) practice, some bank notes: they were notes but of small value, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) missed them he (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) was easily persuaded by Champfort that, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Champfort</b></font>) had been much intoxicated the preceding night, he (<font color='blue'><b>Champfort</b></font>) had thrown them away with some useless papers. He (<font color='blue'><b>Champfort</b></font>) rummaged through his (<font color='blue'><b>Champfort</b></font>) writing-desk in vain, and then gave up the search. It was true that on this very occasion he (<font color='blue'><b>Champfort</b></font>) gave Champfort the remainder of some mourning paper, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Champfort</b></font>) made no scruple, therefore, of producing openly. Certain that he (<font color='blue'><b>Champfort</b></font>) could swear to his (<font color='blue'><b>Champfort</b></font>) own private mark, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Champfort</b></font>) could identify his (<font color='blue'><b>Champfort</b></font>) notes by their numbers, &c., of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Champfort</b></font>) had luckily a memorandum, Lord Delacour, enraged to find himself both robbed and duped by a favourite servant, in whom he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) had placed implicit confidence, was effectually roused from his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) natural indolence: he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) took such active and successful measures, that Mr Champfort was committed to gaol, to take his (<font color='blue'><b>Champfort</b></font>) trial for the robbery. To make peace for himself, he (<font color='blue'><b>Champfort</b></font>) confessed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Champfort</b></font>) had been instigated by Mrs Freke to get the anonymous letter written. This lady was now suffering just punishment for her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) frolics, and Lady Delacour thought her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) fallen so much below indignation, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) advised Belinda to take no manner of notice of her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) conduct, except by simply returning the letter to her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>), with <div class="bookquote">``Miss Portman's, Mr Vincent's, and Lord and Lady Delacour's, compliments and thanks to a sincere friend, who had been the means of bringing villany to justice.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>So much for Mrs Freke and Mr Champfort, who, both together, scarcely deserve an episode of ten lines.

<p/>Now to return to Mr Vincent. Animated by fresh hope, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) pressed his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) suit with Belinda with all the ardour of his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) sanguine temper. Though little disposed to fear any future evil, especially in the midst of present felicity, yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) was aware of the danger that might ensue to him (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) from Clarence Hervey's arrival; he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) was therefore impatient for the intermediate day to pass, and it was with heartfelt joy that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) saw the carriages at last at the door, which were actually to convey them to Oakly-park. Mr Vincent, who had all the West Indian love for magnificence, had upon this occasion an extremely handsome equipage. Lady Delacour, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) was disappointed by Clarence Hervey's not appearing, did not attempt to delay their departure. She (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) contented herself with leaving a note, to be delivered to him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) on his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) arrival, which, she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) still flattered herself, would induce him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) immediately to go to Harrowgate. The trunks were fastened upon the carriages, the imperial was carrying out, Marriott was full of a world of business, Lord Delacour was looking at his (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) horses as usual, Helena was patting Mr Vincent's great dog, and Belinda was rallying her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) lover upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) taste for `the pomp, pride, and circumstance' of glorious travelling -- when an express arrived from Oakly-park. It was to delay their journey for a few weeks. Mr Percival and Lady Anne wrote word, that they were unexpectedly called from home by --. Lady Delacour did not stay to read by what, or by whom, she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) was so much delighted by this reprieve. Mr Vincent bore the disappointment as well as could be expected; particularly when Belinda observed, to comfort him (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>), that `the mind is its own place;' and that hers, she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) believed, would be the same at Twickenham as at Oakly-park. Nor did she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) give him (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) any reason to regret that she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) was not immediately under the influence of his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) own friends. The dread of being unduly biassed by Lady Delacour, and the strong desire Belinda felt to act honourably by Mr Vincent, to show him (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) was not trifling with his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) happiness, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) was incapable of the meanness of retaining a lover as a pis-aller, were motives which acted more powerfully in his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) favour than all that even Lady Anne Percival could have looked or said. The contrast between the openness and decision of his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) conduct towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>), and Clarence Hervey's vacillation and mystery; the belief that Mr Hervey was or ought to be attached to another woman; the conviction that Mr Vincent was strongly attached to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) possessed many of the good qualities essential to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) happiness, operated every day more and more strongly upon Belinda's mind.

<p/>Where was Clarence Hervey all this time? Lady Delacour, alas! could not divine. She (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) every morning was certain that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) would appear that day, and every night she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) was forced to acknowledge her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) mistake. No inquiries -- and she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) had made all that could be made, by address and perseverance -- no inquiries could clear up the mystery of Virginia and Mrs Ormond, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) impatience to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) friend Clarence every hour increased. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) was divided between her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) confidence in him (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) affection for Belinda; unwilling to give him (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) up, yet afraid to injure her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) happiness, or to offend her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>), by injudicious advice, and improper interference. One thing kept Lady Delacour for some time in spirits -- Miss Portman's assurance that she (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) would not bind herself by any promise or engagement to Mr Vincent, even when decided in his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) favour; and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) should hold both him (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) and herself perfectly free till they were actually married. This was according to Lady Anne and Mr Percival's principles, and Lady Delacour was never tired of expressing directly or indirectly her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) admiration of the prudence and propriety of their doctrine.

<p/>Lady Delacour recollected her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) own promise, to give her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) sincere congratulations to the victorious knight; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) endeavoured to treat Mr Vincent with impartiality. She (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) was, however, now still less inclined to like him (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>), from a discovery, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) accidentally made, of his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) being still upon good terms with odious Mrs Luttridge. Helena, one morning, was playing with Mr Vincent's large dog, of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) was excessively fond. It was called Juba, after his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) faithful servant.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Helena, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>said Lady Delacour, `take care! don't trust your hand in that creature's monstrous mouth.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can assure your ladyship,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr Vincent/Vincent</b></font>)</div>cried Mr Vincent, `that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) is the very quietest and best creature in the world.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No doubt,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Belinda, smiling, `since he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) belongs to you, for you know, as Mr Percival tells you, every thing animate or inanimate that is under your protection, you think must be the best of its kind in the universe.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But, really, Juba is the best creature in the world,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr Vincent/Vincent</b></font>)</div>repeated Mr Vincent, with great eagerness. <div class="bookquote">``Juba is, without exception, the best creature in the universe.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Juba, the dog, or Juba, the man?''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Belinda: `you know, they cannot be both the best creatures in the universe.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well! Juba, the man, is the best man -- and Juba, the dog, is the best dog, in the universe,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr Vincent/Vincent</b></font>)</div>said Mr Vincent, laughing, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) usual candour, at his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) own foible, when it was pointed out to him (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``But, seriously, Lady Delacour, you need not be in the least afraid to trust Miss Delacour with this poor fellow; for, do you know, during a whole month that I lent him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) to Mrs Luttridge, at Harrowgate, she (<font color='blue'><b>Luttridge</b></font>) used constantly to let him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) sleep in the room with her (<font color='blue'><b>Luttridge</b></font>); and now, whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) sees her (<font color='blue'><b>Luttridge</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) licks her (<font color='blue'><b>Luttridge</b></font>) hand as gently as if he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) were a lapdog; and it was but yesterday, when I had him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) there, she (<font color='blue'><b>Luttridge</b></font>) declared he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) was more gentle than any lapdog in London.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div><p/>At the name of Luttridge, Lady Delacour changed countenance, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) continued silent for some time. Mr Vincent, attributing her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) sudden seriousness to dislike or fear of his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) dog, took him (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) out of the room.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear Lady Delacour,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Belinda, observing that she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) still retained an air of displeasure, <div class="bookquote">``I hope your antipathy to odious Mrs Luttridge does not extend to every body who visits her (<font color='blue'><b>Luttridge</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Tout au contraire,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>cried Lady Delacour, starting from her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) reverie, and assuming a playful manner: <div class="bookquote">``I have made a general gaol-delivery of all my old hatreds; and even odious Mrs Luttridge, though a hardened offender, must be included in this act of grace: so you need not fear that Mr Vincent should fall under my royal displeasure for consorting with this state criminal. Though I can't sympathize with him (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>), I forgive him (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>), both for liking that great dog, and that little woman; especially, as I shrewdly suspect, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) likes the lady's E O table better than the lady.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div><p/>``E O table! Good Heavens! you do not imagine Mr Vincent -- '

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, my dear, don't look so terribly alarmed! I assure you, I did not mean to hint that there was any serious, improper attachment to the E O table; only a little flirtation, perhaps, to which his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) passion for you has, doubtless, put a stop.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) the moment I see him (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>cried Belinda, `if he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) is fond of play: I know he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) used to play at billiards at Oakly-park, but merely as an amusement. Games of address are not to be put upon a footing with games of hazard.''

<p/>``A man may, however, contrive to lose a good deal of money at billiards, as poor Lord Delacour can tell you. But I beseech you, my dear, do not betray me to Mr Vincent; ten to one I am mistaken, for his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) great dog put me out of humour -- '

<p/>``But with such a doubt upon my mind, unsatisfied -- '

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It shall be satisfied; Lord Delacour shall make inquiries for me. Lord Delacour shall make inquiries, did I say? -- will, I should have said. If Champfort had heard me, to what excellent account he (<font color='blue'><b>Champfort</b></font>) might have turned that unlucky shall. What a nice grammarian a woman had need to be, who would live well with a husband inferior to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) in understanding! With a superior or an equal, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) might use shall and will as inaccurately as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) pleases. Glorious privilege! How I shall envy it you, my dear Belinda! But how can you ever hope to enjoy it? Where is your superior? Where is your equal?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr Vincent/Vincent</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr Vincent, who had by this time seen his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) dog fed, which was one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) daily pleasures, returned, and politely assured Lady Delacour that Juba should not again intrude. To make her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) peace with Mr Vincent, and to drive the E O table from Belinda's thoughts, her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) ladyship now turned the conversation from Juba the dog, to Juba the man. She (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) talked of Harriet Freke's phosphoric Obeah woman, of whom, she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) said, she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) had heard an account from Miss Portman. From thence she (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) went on to the African slave trade, by way of contrast, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) finished precisely where she (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) intended, and where Mr Vincent could have wished, by praising a poem called <div class="bookquote">``The dying Negro,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr Vincent/Vincent</b></font>)</div>which he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) had the preceding evening brought to read to Belinda. This praise was peculiarly agreeable, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) was not perfectly sure of his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) own critical judgment, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) knowledge of English literature was not as extensive as Clarence Hervey's; a circumstance which Lady Delacour had discovered one morning, when they went to see Pope's famous villa at Twickenham. Flattered by her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) present confirmation of his (<font color='blue'><b>Pope</b></font>) taste, Mr Vincent readily complied with a request to read the poem to Belinda. They were all deeply engaged by the charms of poetry, when they were suddenly interrupted by the entrance of -- Clarence Hervey!

<p/>The book dropped from Vincent's hand the instant that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) heard his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) name. Lady Delacour's eyes sparkled with joy. Belinda's colour rose, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) countenance maintained an expression of calm dignity. Mr Hervey, upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) first entrance, appeared prepared to support an air of philosophic composure, which forsook him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) before he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) had walked across the room. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) seemed overpowered by the kindness with which Lady Delacour received his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) congratulations on her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) recovery -- struck by the reserve of Belinda's manner -- but not surprised, or displeased, at the sight of Mr Vincent. On the contrary, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) desired immediately to be introduced to him (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>), with the air of a man resolute to cultivate his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) friendship. Provoked and perplexed, Lady Delacour, in a tone of mingled reproach and astonishment, exclaimed, ``Though you have not done me the honour, Mr Hervey, to take any other notice of my last letter, I am to understand, I presume, by the manner in which you desire me to introduce you to our friend Mr Vincent, that it has been received. '

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Received! Good Heavens! have not you had my answer?''  (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div>cried Clarence Hervey, with a voice and look of extreme surprise and emotion: <div class="bookquote">``Has not your ladyship received a packet?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have had no packet -- I have had no letter. Mr Vincent, do me the favour to ring the bell,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>cried Lady Delacour, eagerly: <div class="bookquote">``I'll know, this instant, what's become of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Your ladyship must have thought me -- ,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) spoke, his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) eye involuntarily glanced towards Belinda.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No matter what I thought you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>cried Lady Delacour, who forgave him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) every thing for this single glance; `if I did you a little injustice, Clarence, when I was angry, you must forgive me; for, I assure you, I do you a great deal of justice at other times.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Did any letter, any packet, come here for me? Inquire, inquire,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>), impatiently, to the servant who came in. No letter or packet was to be heard of. It had been directed, Mr Hervey now remembered, to her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) ladyship's house in town. She (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) gave orders to have it immediately sent for; but scarcely had she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) given them, when, turning to Mr Hervey, she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) laughed and said, <div class="bookquote">``A very foolish compliment to you and your letter, for you certainly can speak as well as you can write; nay, better, I think -- though you don't write ill, neither -- but you can tell me, in two words, what in writing would take half a volume. Leave this gentleman and lady to `the dying Negro,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and let me hear your two words in Lord Delacour's dressing-room, if you please,'' said she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>), opening the door of an adjoining apartment. ``Lord Delacour will not be jealous if he (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) find you tête-à-tête with me, I promise you. But you shall not be compelled. You look -- '

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I look,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div>said Mr Hervey, affecting to laugh, `as if I felt the impossibility of putting half a volume into two words. It is a long story, and -- '

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And I must wait for the packet, whether I will or no -- well, be it so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>said Lady Delacour. Struck with the extreme perturbation into which he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) was thrown, she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) pressed him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) with no farther raillery, but instantly attempted to change the conversation to general subiects.

<p/>Again she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) had recourse to `the dying Negro.'' Mr Vincent, to whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) now addressed herself, said, ``For my part, I neither have, nor pretend to have, much critical taste; but I admire in this poem the manly, energetic spirit of virtue which it breathes.<div class="bookquote">'' From the poem, an easy transition was made to the author; and Clarence Hervey, exerting himself to join in the conversation, observed, `that this writer -LRB-Mr Day-RRB- was an instance that genuine eloquence must spring from the heart. Cicero was certainly right,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>continued he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr</b></font>), addressing himself to Mr Vincent, `in his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) definition of a great orator, to make it one of the first requisites, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) should be a good man.''

<p/>Mr Vincent coldly replied, <div class="bookquote">``This definition would exclude too many men of superior talents, to be easily admitted.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr Vincent/Vincent</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps the appearance of virtue,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Belinda, `might, on many occasions, succeed as well as the reality.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, if the man be as good an actor as Mr Hervey,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>said Lady Delacour, `and if he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) suit <div class="bookquote">``the action to the word''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>-- <div class="bookquote">``the word to the action.'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'

<p/>Belinda never raised her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) eyes whilst her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) ladyship uttered these words; Mr Vincent was, or seemed to be, so deeply engaged in looking for something in the book, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) held in his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) hand, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) could take no farther part in the conversation; and a dead silence ensued.

<p/>Lady Delacour, who was naturally impatient in the extreme, especially in the vindication of her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) friends, could not bear to see, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) did by Belinda's countenance, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) had not forgotten Marriott's story of Virginia St Pierre; and though her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) ladyship was convinced that the packet would clear up all mysteries, yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) could not endure that even in the interim `poor Clarence' should be unjustly suspected; nor could she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) refrain from trying an expedient, which just occurred to her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>), to satisfy herself and every body present. She (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) was the first to break silence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``To do ye justice, my friends, you are all good company this morning. Mr Vincent is excusable, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) is in love; and Belinda is excusable, because -- because -- Mr Hervey, pray help me to an excuse for Miss Portman's stupidity, for I am dreadfully afraid of blundering out the truth. But why do I ask you to help me? In your present condition, you seem totally unable to help yourself. -- Not a word! -- Run over the common-places of conversation -- weather -- fashion -- scandal -- dress -- deaths -- marriages. -- Will none of these do? Suppose, then, you were to entertain me with other people's thoughts, since you have none of your own unpacked -- Forfeit to arbitrary power,''  (<font color='red'><b>ladyship</b></font>)</div>continued her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) ladyship, playfully seizing Mr Vincent's book. <div class="bookquote">``I have always observed that none submit with so good a grace to arbitrary power from our sex as your true men of spirit, who would shed the last drop of their blood to resist it from one of their own. Inconsistent creatures, the best of you! So read this charming little poem to us, Mr Hervey, will you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) was going to begin immediately, but Lady Delacour put her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) hand upon the book, and stopped him (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>).

<p/>``Stay; though I am tyrannical, I will not be treacherous. I warn you, then, that I have imposed upon you a difficult, a dangerous task. If you have any ``sins unwhipt of justice,<div class="bookquote">'' there are lines which I defy you to read without faltering -- listen to the preface.''

 (<font color='red'><b>ladyship</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) ladyship began as follows:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr Day, indeed, retained during all the periods of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr</b></font>) life, as might be expected from his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr</b></font>) character, a strong detestation of female seduction **** Happening to see some verses, written by a young lady, on a recent event of this nature, which was succeeded by a fatal catastrophe -- the unhappy young woman, who had been a victim to the perfidy of a lover, overpowered by her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) sensibility of shame, having died of a broken heart -- he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) expresses his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) sympathy with the fair poetess, in the following manner.''


 (<font color='red'><b>ladyship</b></font>)</div><p/>Lady Delacour paused, and fixed her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) eyes upon Clarence Hervey. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>), with all the appearance of conscious innocence, received the book, without hestitation, from her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) hands, and read aloud the lines, to which she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) pointed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Swear by the dread avengers of the tomb,
By all thy hopes, by death's tremendous gloom,
That ne'er by thee deceived, the tender maid
Shall mourn her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) easy confidence betray'd,
Nor weep in secret the triumphant art,
With bitter anguish rankling in her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) heart;
So may each blessing, which impartial fate
Throws on the good, but snatches from the great,
Adorn thy favour'd course with rays divine,
And Heaven's best gift, a virtuous love, be thine!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div>Mr Hervey read these lines with so much unaffected, unembarrassed energy, that Lady Delacour could not help casting a triumphant look at Belinda, which said, or seemed to say -- you see, I was right in my opinion of Clarence!

<p/>Had Mr Vincent been left to his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) own observations, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) would have seen the simple truth; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) was alarmed and deceived by Lady Delacour's imprudent expressions of joy, and by the significant looks that she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) friend, Miss Portman, which seemed to be looks of mutual intelligence. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) scarcely dared to turn his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) eyes towards his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) mistress, or upon him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) whom he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) thought his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) rival; but he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) kept them anxiously fixed upon her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) ladyship, in whose face, as in a glass, he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) seemed to study every thing that was passing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Pray, have you ever played at chess, since we saw you last?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>said Lady Delacour to Clarence. <div class="bookquote">``I hope you do not forget that you are my knight. I do not forget it, I assure you -- I own you as my knight to all the world, in public and private -- do not I, Belinda?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr Vincent/Vincent</b></font>)</div><p/>A dark cloud overspread Mr Vincent's brow -- he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) listened not to Belinda's answer. Seized with a transport of jealousy, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) darted at Mr Hervey a glance of mingled scorn and rage; and, after saying a few unintelligible words to Miss Portman and Lady Delacour, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) left the room.

<p/>Clarence Hervey, who seemed afraid to trust himself longer with Belinda, withdrew a few minutes afterward.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear Belinda,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Lady Delacour, the moment that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) was out of the room, `how glad I am he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) is gone, that I may say all the good I think of him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>)! In the first place, Clarence Hervey loves you. Never was I so fully convinced of it as this day. Why had we not that letter of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) sooner? that will explain all to us: but I ask for no explanation, I ask for no letter, to confirm my opinion, my conviction -- that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) loves you; on this point I cannot be mistaken -- he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) fondly loves you.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) fondly loves her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>)! -- Yes, to be sure, I could have told you that news long ago,''  (<font color='red'><b>dowager</b></font>)</div>cried the dowager Lady Boucher, who was in the room before they were aware of her (<font color='blue'><b>Boucher</b></font>) entrance; they had both been so eager, the one listening, and the other speaking.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Fondly loves her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>the dowager</b></font>)</div>repeated the dowager: `yes; and no secret, I promise you, Lady Delacour:' and then, turning to Belinda, she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) began a congratulatory speech, upon the report of her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) approaching marriage with Mr Vincent. Belinda absolutely denied the truth of this report: but the dowager continued, <div class="bookquote">``I distress you, I see, and it's quite out of rule, I am sensible, to speak in this sort of way, Miss Portman; but, as I'm an old acquaintance, and an old friend, and an old woman, you'll excuse me. I can't help saying, I feel quite rejoiced at your meeting with such a match.''  (<font color='red'><b>the dowager</b></font>)</div>Belinda again attempted to declare that she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) was not going to be married; but the invincible dowager went on: <div class="bookquote">``Every way eligible, and every way agreeable. A charming young man, I hear, Lady Delacour: I see I must only speak to you, or I shall make Miss Portman sink to the centre of the earth, which I would not wish to do, especially at such a critical moment as this. A charming young man, I hear, with a noble West Indian fortune, and a noble spirit, and well connected, and passionately in love -- no wonder. But I have done now, I promise you; I'll ask no questions: so, don't run away, Miss Portman; I'll ask no questions, I promise you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the dowager</b></font>)</div><p/>To ensure the performance of this promise, Lady Delacour asked, what news there was in the world? This question, she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) knew, would keep the dowager in delightful employment. ``I live quite out of the world here; but since Lady Boucher has the charity to come to see me, we shall hear all the ``secrets worth knowing,<div class="bookquote">'' from the best authority.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then, the first piece of news, I have for you is, that my Lord and my Lady Delacour are absolutely reconciled; and that they are the happiest couple that ever lived.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``All very true,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>replied Lady Delacour.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``True!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Boucher</b></font>)</div>repeated Lady Boucher: `why, my dear Lady Delacour, you amaze me! -- Are you in earnest? -- Was there ever any thing so provoking? -- There have I been contradicting the report, wherever I went, for I was convinced that the whole story was a mistake, and a fabrication.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The history of the reformation might not be exact, but the reformation itself your ladyship may depend upon, since you hear it from my own lips.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, how amazing! -- how incredible! -- Lord bless me! But your ladyship certainly is not in earnest? for you look just the same, and speak just in the same sort of way: I see no alteration, I confess.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``And what alteration, my good Lady Boucher, did you expect to see? Did you think, that, by way of being exemplarily virtuous, I should, like Lady Q-- let my sentences come out of my mouth only at the rate of a word a minute?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Like -- minute -- drops -- from -- off -- the -- caves.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Or did you expect that, in hopes of being a pattern for the rising generation, I should hold my features in penance, immoveably, thus -- like some of the poor ladies of Antigua, who, after they have blistered their faces all over, to get a fine complexion, are forced, whilst the new skin is coming, to sit, without speaking, smiling, or moving muscle or feature, lest an indelible wrinkle should be the consequence?''
Lady Boucher was impatient to have this speech finished, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Boucher</b></font>) had a piece of news to tell. ``Well!<div class="bookquote">'' cried she (<font color='blue'><b>Boucher</b></font>), `there's no knowing what to believe or disbelieve, one hears so many strange reports; but I have a piece of news for you, that you may all depend upon. I have one secret worth knowing, I can tell your ladyship -- and one, your ladyship and Miss Portman, I'm sure, will be rejoiced to hear. Your friend, Clarence Hervey, is going to married.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Married! married!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>cried Lady Delacour.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, ay, your ladyship may look as much astonished as you please, you cannot be more so than I was when I heard it. Clarence Hervey, Miss Portman, that was looked upon so completely, you know, as not a marrying man; and now the last man upon earth, that your ladyship would suspect of marrying in this sort of way!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In what sort of way? -- My dear Belinda, how can you stand this fire?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>said Lady Delacour, placing a skreen, dexterously, to hide her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) face from the dowager's observation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now only guess whom he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is going to marry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Boucher</b></font>)</div>continued Lady Boucher: <div class="bookquote">``Whom do you guess, Miss Portman?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Boucher</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``An amiable woman, I should guess, from Mr Hervey's general character,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>cried Lady Delacour.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, an amiable woman, I take for granted; every woman is amiable of course, as the newspapers tell us, when she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is going to be married,''  (<font color='red'><b>the dowager</b></font>)</div>said the dowager: `an amiable woman, to be sure; but that means nothing. I have not had a guess from Miss Portman.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``From general character,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>Belinda began, in a constrained voice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do not guess from general character, my dear Belinda,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>interrupted Lady Delacour; `for there is no judging in these cases, from general character, of what people will like or dislike.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then I will leave it to your ladyship to guess this time, if you please,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Belinda.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You will neither of you guess till doomsday!''  (<font color='red'><b>the dowager</b></font>)</div>cried the dowager; <div class="bookquote">``I must tell you. Mr Hervey's going to marry -- in the strangest sort of way! -- a girl that nobody knows -- a daughter of a Mr Hartley. The father can give her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) a good fortune, it is true; but one should not have supposed that fortune was an object with Mr Hervey, who has such a noble one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) own. It's really difficult to believe it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the dowager</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So difficult, that I find it quite impossible,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>said Lady Delacour, with an incredulous smile.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Depend upon it, my dear Lady Delacour,''  (<font color='red'><b>the dowager</b></font>)</div>said the dowager, laying the convincing weight of her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) arm upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) ladyship's, `depend upon it, my dear Lady Delacour, that my information is correct. Guess whom I had it from.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Willingly. But first let me tell you, that I have seen Mr Hervey within this half hour, and I never saw a man look less like a bridegroom.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed! well, I've heard too, that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) didn't like the match: but what a pity, when you saw him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) yourself this morning, that you didn't get all the particulars out of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). But let him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) look like what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) will, you'll find that my information is perfectly correct. -- Guess whom I had it from -- from Mrs Margaret Delacour: it was at her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) house that Clarence Hervey first met Mr Hartley, who, as I mentioned, is the father of the young lady. There was a charming scene, and some romantic story, about his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) finding the girl in a cottage, and calling her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) Virginia something or other, but I didn't clearly understand about that. However, this much is certain, that the girl, as her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) father told Mrs Delacour, is desperately in love with Mr Hervey, and they are to be married immediately. Depend upon it, you'll find my information correct. Good morning to you. Lord bless me! now I recollect, I once heard that Mr Hervey was a great admirer of Miss Portman,''  (<font color='red'><b>the dowager</b></font>)</div>said the dowager.

<p/>The inquisitive dowager, whose curiosity was put upon a new scent, immediately fastened her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) eyes upon Belinda's face; but from that she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) could make out nothing. Was it because she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) had not the best eyes, or because there was nothing to be seen? To determine this question, she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) looked through her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) glass, to take a clearer view; but Lady Delacour drew off her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) attention, by suddenly exclaiming -- <div class="bookquote">``My dear Lady Boucher, when you go back to town, do send me a bottle of concentrated anima of quassia.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! ha! have I made a convert of you at last?''  (<font color='red'><b>the dowager</b></font>)</div>said the dowager, and, satisfied with the glory of this conversion, she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) departed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Admire my knowledge of human nature, my dear Belinda,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>said Lady Delacour. <div class="bookquote">``Now she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) will talk, at the next place she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) goes to, of nothing but of my faith in anima of quassia; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) will forget to make a gossiping story out of that most imprudent hint I gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>), about Clarence Hervey's having been an admirer of yours.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do not leave the room, Belinda; I have a thousand things to say to you, my dear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Excuse me, at present, my dear Lady Delacour; I am impatient to write a few lines to Mr Vincent. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) went away -- '

<p/><div class="bookquote">``In a fit of jealousy, and I am glad of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And I am sorry for it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Belinda; `sorry that he (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) should have so little confidence in me as to feel jealousy without cause -- without sufficient cause, I should say; for certainly, your ladyship gave pain, by the manner in which you received Mr Hervey.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Lord, my dear, you would spoil any man upon earth. You could not act more foolishly, if the man were your husband. Are you privately married to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)? -- If you be not -- for my sake -- for your own -- for Mr Vincent's -- do not write till we see the contents of Clarence Hervey's packet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It can make no alteration in what I write,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Belinda.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, my dear; write what you please; but I only hope you will not send your letter till the packet arrives.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Pardon me, I shall send it as soon as I possibly can: the ``dear delight of giving pain<div class="bookquote">'' does not suit my taste.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div><p/>Lady Delacour, as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) was left alone, began to reconsider the dowager's story; notwithstanding her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) unbelieving smile, it alarmed her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>), for she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) could not refuse to give it some degree of credit, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) learnt that Mrs Margaret Delacour was the authority from whom it came. Mrs Delacour was a woman of scrupulous veracity, and rigid in her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) dislike to gossiping; so that it was scarcely probably a report originating with her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>), however it might be altered by the way, should prove to be totally void of foundation. The name of Virginia coincided with Sir Philip Baddely's hints, and with Marriott's discoveries: these circumstances considered, Lady Delacour knew not what opinion to form; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) eagerness to receive Mr Hervey's packet every moment increased. She (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) walked up and down the room -- looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) watch -- fancied that it had stopped -- held it to her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) ear -- rang the bell every quarter of an hour, to inquire whether the messenger was not yet come back. At last, the long-expected packet arrived. She (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) seized it, and hurried with it immediately to Belinda's room.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Clarence Hervey's packet, my love! -- Now, woe be to the person who interrupts us!''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) bolted the door as she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) spoke -- rolled an arm-chair to the fire -- <div class="bookquote">``Now for it!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>), seating herself. <div class="bookquote">``The devil upon two sticks, if he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) were looking down upon me from the house-top, or Champfort, who is the worse devil of the two, would, if he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) were peeping through the keyhole, swear I was going to open a love letter -- and so I hope I am. Now for it!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>cried she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>), breaking the seal.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear friend,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Belinda, laying her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) hand upon Lady Delacour's, `before we open this packet, let me speak to you, whilst our minds are calm.''

<p/>``Calm! It is the strangest time for your mind to be calm. But I must not affront you by my incredulity. Speak, then, but be quick, for I do not pretend to be calm; it not being, thank my stars, ``mon métier d'être philosophe.<div class="bookquote">'' Crack goes the last seal -- speak now, or forever after hold your tongue, my calm philosopher of Oakly-park; but do you wish me to attend to what you are going to say?''

 (<font color='red'><b>philosophe</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>replied Belinda, smiling, `that is the usual wish of those who speak.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very true; and I can listen tolerably well, when I don't know what people are going to say; but when I know it all before hand, I have an unfortunate habit of not being able to attend to one word. Now, my dear, let me anticipate your speech, and, if my anticipation be wrong, then you shall rise to explain; and I will,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>), -LRB-putting her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) finger on her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) lips-RRB- `listen to you, like Harpocrates, without moving an eye-lash.''

<p/>Belinda, as the most certain way of being heard, consented to hear, before she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) spoke.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I will tell you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>pursued Lady Delacour, `if not what you are going to say to me, at least what you say to yourself, which is fully as much to the purpose. You say to yourself, <div class="bookquote">``Let this packet of Clarence Hervey contain what it may, it comes too late. Let him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) say, or let him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) do, `tis all the same to me, -- because -- -LRB-now for the reasoning-RRB- -- because things have gone so far with Mr Vincent, that Lady Anne Percival, and all the world -LRB-at Oakly-park-RRB- will blame me, if I retract. In short, things have gone so far, that I cannot recede; because -- things have gone so far.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>This is the rondeau of your argument. Nay, hear me out, then you shall have your turn, my dear, for an hour, if you please. Let things have gone ever so far, they can stop, and turn about again, cannot they? Lady Anne Percival is your friend, of course can wish only for your happiness. You think she (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) is <div class="bookquote">``the thing that's most uncommon, a reasonable woman:''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>then she (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) cannot be angry with you for being happy your own way. So I need not, as the orators say, labour this point any more. Now, as to your aunt. The fear of displeasing Mrs Stanhope a little more or less is not to be put in competition with the hope of your happiness for life, especially as you have contrived to exist some months in a state of utter excommunication from her (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>) favour. After all, you know she (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>) will not grieve for any thing but the loss of Mr Vincent's fortune; and Mr Hervey's fortune might do as well, or almost as well: at least, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>) may compound with her (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>) pride for the difference, by considering, that an English member of parliament is, in the eyes of the world -LRB-the only eyes with which she (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>) sees-RRB- a better connexion than the son of a West India planter, even though he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) may be a protegé of Lady Anne Percival.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Spare me your indignation, my dear! -- What a look was there! -- Reasoning for Mrs Stanhope, must not I reason as Mrs Stanhope does? -- Now, I will put this stronger still. Suppose that you had actually acknowledged that Mr Vincent had got beyond esteem with you; suppose that you had in due form consented to marry him (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>); suppose that preparations were at this moment making for the wedding; even in that desperate case I should say to you, you are not a girl to marry because your wedding-gown is made up. Some few guineas are thrown away, perhaps; do not throw away your whole happiness after them -- that would be sorry economy. Trust me, my dear, I should say, as I have to you, in time of need. Or, if you fear to be obliged to one who never was afraid of being obliged to you, ten to one the preparations for a wedding, though not the wedding, may be necessary immediately. No matter to Mrs Franks who the bridegroom may be; so that her (<font color='blue'><b>Franks</b></font>) bill be paid, she (<font color='blue'><b>Franks</b></font>) would not care the turning of a feather whether it be paid by Mrs Vincent or Mrs Hervey. I hope I have convinced, I am sure I have made you blush, my dear, and that is some satisfaction. A blush at this moment is an earnest of victory. Io, triumphe! Now I will open my packet; my hand shall not be held an instant longer.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I absolve you from the penance of hearing me for an hour, but I claim your promise to attend to me for a few minutes, my dear friend,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Belinda: <div class="bookquote">``I thank you most sincerely for your kindness; and let me assure you that I should not hesitate to accept from you any species of obligation.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thanks! thanks! -- there's a dear good girl! -- my own Belinda!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``But indeed you totally misunderstand me; your reasoning -- '

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>said Lady Delacour; <div class="bookquote">``I take nothing for granted, as you will find, when I open this packet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You have taken it for granted,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>continued Belinda, `that I am still secretly attached to him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>), and you take it for granted that I am restrained only by fear of Lady Ann Percival, my aunt, and the world, from breaking off with Mr Vincent: if you will read this letter, which I was writing to him (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) when you came into the room, perhaps you will be convinced of your mistake.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Read a letter to Mr Vincent at such a time as this! then I will go and read my packet in my own room,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>cried Lady Delacour, rising hastily, with evident displeasure.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not even your displeasure, my dear friend,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Belinda, `can alter my determination to behave with consistency and openness towards Mr Vincent; and I can bear your anger, for I know it arises from your regard for me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I never said so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>replied Belinda: `you have not read my letter. Oh, Lady Delacour, at this instant -- you should not reproach me.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I did you injustice,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>cried Lady Delacour, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) now looked at Belinda's letter. <div class="bookquote">``Send it -- send it -- you have said the very thing you ought; and now sit down with me to this packet of Clarence Hervey's -- be just to him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>), as you are to Mr Vincent, that's all I ask -- give him (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) a fair hearing: -- now for it.''

<p/>CLARENCE HERVEY``S packet contained a history of his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) connexion with Virginia St Pierre.

<p/>To save our hero from the charge of egotism, we shall relate the principal circumstances in the third person.

<p/>It was about a year before he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) had seen Belinda, that Clarence Hervey returned from his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) travels; he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) had been in France just before the Revolution, when luxury and dissipation were at their height in Paris, and when a universal spirit of licentious gallantry prevailed. Some circumstances in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) was personally interested disgusted him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) strongly with the Parisian belles; he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) felt that women who were full of vanity, affectation, and artifice, whose tastes were perverted, and whose feelings were depraved, were equally incapable of conferring, or enjoying real happiness. Whilst this conviction was full in his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) mind, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) read the works of Rousseau: this eloquent writer's sense made its full impression upon Clarence's understanding, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) declamations produced more than their just effect upon an imagination naturally ardent. He (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) was charmed with the picture of Sophia, when contrasted with the characters of the women of the world with whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) had been disgusted; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) formed the romantic project of educating a wife for himself. Full of this idea, he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) returned to England, determined to carry his (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) scheme immediately into execution; but was some time delayed by the difficulty of finding a proper object for his (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) purpose: it was easy to meet with beauty in distress, and ignorance in poverty; but it was difficult to find simplicity without vulgarity, ingenuity without cunning, or even ignorance without prejudice; it was difficult to meet with an understanding totally uncultivated, yet likely to reward the labour of late instruction; a heart wholly unpractised, yet full of sensibility, capable of all the enthusiasm of passion, the delicacy of sentiment, and the firmness of rational constancy. It is not wonderful that Mr Hervey, with such high expectations, should not immediately find them gratified. Disappointed in his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) first search, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) did not, however, relinquish his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) design, and at length, by accident, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) discovered, or thought that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) discovered, an object formed expressly for his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) purpose.

<p/>One fine evening in autumn, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) was riding through the New Forest, charmed with the picturesque beauties of the place, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) turned out of the beaten road, and struck into a fresh track, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) pursued with increasing delight, till the setting sun reminded him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>), that it was necessary to postpone his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) further reflections on forest scenery, and that it was time to think of finding his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) way out of the wood. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) was now in the most retired part of the forest, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) saw no path to direct him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>); but, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) stopped to consider which way he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) should turn, a dog sprang from a thicket, barking furiously at his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) horse: his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) horse was high-spirited, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) was master of him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) obliged the animal to stand quietly till the dog, having barked himself hoarse, retreated of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) own accord. Clarence watched to see which way he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) would go, and followed him (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>), in hopes of meeting with the person to whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) belonged: he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) kept his (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) guide in sight, till he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) came into a beautiful glade, in the midst of which was a neat but very small cottage, with numerous beehives in the garden, surrounded by a profusion of rose-trees, which were in full blow. This cultivated spot was strikingly contrasted with the wildness of the surrounding scenery. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) came nearer, Mr Hervey saw a young girl watering the rose-trees, which grew round the cottage, and an old woman beside her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) filling a basket with the flowers. The old woman was like most other old women, except that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had a remarkably benevolent countenance, and an air that had been acquired in better days; but the young girl did not appear to Clarence like any other young girl that he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) had ever seen. The setting sun shone upon her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) countenance, the wind blew aside the ringlets of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) light hair, and the blush of modesty overspread her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) cheeks when she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) looked up at the stranger. In her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) large blue eyes, there was an expression of artless sensibility, with which Mr Hervey was so powerfully struck that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) remained for some moments silent, totally forgetting, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) came to ask his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) way out of the forest. His (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) horse had made so little noise upon the soft grass, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) was within a few yards of them before he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) was perceived by the old woman. As soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) turned abruptly to the young girl, put the basket of roses into her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hand, and bid her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) carry them into the house. As she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) passed him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>), the girl, with a sweet innocent smile, held up the basket to Clarence, and offered him (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) one of the roses.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Go in, Rachel! -- go in, child,''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>said the old woman, in so loud and severe a tone, that both Rachel and Mr Hervey started; the basket was overturned, and the roses all scattered upon the grass. Clarence, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) attempted some apology, was by no means concerned for the accident, as it detained Rachel some instants longer to collect her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) flowers, and gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) an opportunity of admiring her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) finely shaped hands and arms, and the ease and natural grace of her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) motions.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Go in, Rachel,''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>repeated the old woman, in a still more severe tone; `leave the roses there -- I can pick them up, as well as you, child -- go in.''

<p/>The girl looked at the old woman with astonishment, her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) eyes filled with tears, and throwing down the roses that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) held in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) hand, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) said, ``I am going, grandmother. ' The door closed after her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) before Clarence recollected himself sufficiently to tell the old lady how he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) had lost his (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) way, &c. Her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) severity vanished, as soon as her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) grand-daughter was safe in the house, and with much readiness she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) showed him (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) the road for which he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) inquired.

<p/>As soon, however, as it was in his (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) power, he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) returned thither, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) had taken such good note of the place, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) easily found his (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) way to the spot, which appeared to him (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) a terrestrial paradise. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) descended into the valley, he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) heard the humming of bees, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) saw no smoke rising from the cottage chimney -- no dog barked -- no living creature was to be seen -- the house door was shut -- the window-shutters closed -- all was still. The place looked as if it had been deserted by all its inhabitants: the roses had not been watered, many of them had shed their leaves; and a basket half full of dead flowers, was left in the middle of the garden. Clarence alighted, and tried the latch of the door, but it was fastened; he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) listened, but heard no sound; he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) walked round to the back of the house: a small lattice window was half open, and, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) went toward it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) heard a low moaning voice; he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) gently pulled aside the curtain, and peeped in at the window. The room was darkened, his (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) eyes had been dazzled by the sun, so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) could not, at first, see any object distinctly; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) heard the moaning repeated at intervals, and a soft voice at last said --

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, speak to me! -- speak to me once again -- only once -- only once again, speak to me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The voice came from a corner of the room, to which he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) had not yet turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) eyes; and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) drew aside more of the curtain, to let in more light, a figure started up from the side of a bed, at which she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had been kneeling, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) saw the beautiful young girl, with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) hair all dishevelled, and the strongest expression of grief in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) countenance. He (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) asked if he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) could do her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) any service. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) beckoned to him (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) to come in, and then, pointing to the bed, on which the old woman was stretched, said --

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) cannot speak to me -- she (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) cannot move one side -- she (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) has been so these three days -- but she (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) is not dead -- she (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) is not dead!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div><p/>The poor creature had been struck with the palsy. As Clarence went close to the bed, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) opened her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) eyes, and fixing them upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) stretched out her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) withered hand, caught fast hold of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) grand-daughter, and then raising herself, with a violent effort, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) pronounced the word, <div class="bookquote">``Begone!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) face grew black, her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) features convulsed, and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) sunk down again in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) bed, without power of utterance. Clarence left the house instantly, mounted his (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) horse, and galloped to the next town for medical assistance. The poor woman was so far recovered by a skilful apothecary, that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) could, in a few days, articulate so as to be understood. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) knew that her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) end was approaching fast, and seemed piously resigned to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) fate. Mr Hervey went constantly to see her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>); but, though grateful to him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) for his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) humanity, and for the assistance he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) had procured for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), yet she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) appeared agitated when he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) was in the room, and frequently looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) and at her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) grand-daughter with uncommon anxiety. At last, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) whispered something to the girl, who immediately left the room; and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) then beckoned to him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) to come closer to the arm-chair, in which she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was seated.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``May be, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), `you thought me out of my right mind the day when I was lying on that bed, and said to you in such a peremptory tone, <div class="bookquote">``Begone!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>-- It was all I could say then; and, in truth, I cannot speak quite plain yet; nor ever shall again. But God's will be done. I had only one thing to say to you, sir, about that poor girl of mine -- '

<p/>Clarence listened to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) with eagerness. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) paused, and then laying her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) cold hand upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) looked up earnestly in his (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) face, and continued, <div class="bookquote">``You are a fine young gentleman, and you look like a good gentleman, but so did the man who broke the heart of her (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) poor mother. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) mother was carried off from a boarding-school, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) was scarcely sixteen, by a wretch, who, after privately marrying her (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>), would not own his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) marriage, staid with her (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) but two years, then went abroad, left his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) infant, and has never been heard of since. My daughter died of a broken heart. Rachel was then between three and four years old; a beautiful child. God forgive her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) father! -- God's will be done!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>-- She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) paused to subdue her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) emotion, and then, with some difficulty, proceeded.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My only comfort is, I have bred Rachel up in innocence; I never sent her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) to a boarding-school. No, no; from the moment of her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) birth till now, I have kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) under my own eye. In this cottage she (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) has lived with me, away from all the world. You are the first man she (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) ever spoke to; the first man who ever was within these doors. She (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) is innocence itself! -- Oh, sir! as you hope for mercy, when you are as I am now, spare the innocence of that poor child! -- Never, never come here after her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>), when I am dead and gone! Consider, she (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) is but a child, sir. God never made a better creature. Oh, promise me you will not be the ruin of my sweet innocent girl, and I shall die in peace!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div><p/>Clarence Hervey was touched. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) instantly made the promise required of him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>); and, as nothing less would satisfy the poor dying woman, confirmed it by a solemn oath.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now I am easy,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), `quite easy; and may God bless you for it. In the village here, there is a Mrs Smith, a good farmer's wife, who knows us well; she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) will see to have me decently buried, and then has promised to sell all the little I have for my girl, and to take care of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). And you'll never come near her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) more?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I did not promise that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div>said Hervey.

<p/>The old woman again looked much disturbed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, good young gentleman!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), `take my advice, it will best for you both. If you see her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) again, you will love her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), sir -- you can't help it; and, if she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) sees you -- poor thing, how innocently she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) smiled when she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) gave you the rose! -- oh, sir, never come near her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) when I am gone! It is too late for me now to get her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) out of your way. This night, I'm sure, will be my last in this world -- oh, promise me you will never come here again!''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``After the oath I have taken,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div>replied Clarence, `that promise would be unnecessary. Trust to my honour.''

<p/>``Honour! Oh, that was the word the gentleman said that betrayed her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) poor mother, and left her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) afterwards to die! -- Oh, sir, sir, -- '

<p/>The violent emotion that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) felt was too much for her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) -- she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) fell back exhausted -- never spoke more -- and an hour afterwards she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) expired in the arms of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) grand-daughter. The poor girl could not believe that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had breathed her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) last. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) made a sign to the surgeon, and to Clarence Hervey, who stood beside her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), to be silent; and listened, fancying that the corpse would breathe again. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) cold lips, and the shrivelled cheeks, and the eyelids that were closed for ever. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) warmed the dead fingers with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) breath -- she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) raised the heavy arm, and when it fell she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) perceived there was no hope: she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) threw herself upon her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) knees: -- <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) is dead!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) exclaimed; `and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) has died without giving me her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) blessing! She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) can never bless me again.''

<p/>They took her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) into the air, and Clarence Hervey sprinkled water upon her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) face. It was a fine night, and the fresh air soon brought her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) senses. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) then said that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) would leave her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to the care of the surgeon, and ride to the village in search of that Mrs Smith, who had promised to be her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) friend.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And so you are going away from me too?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>); and she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) burst into tears. At the sight of these tears Clarence turned away, and hurried from her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) sent the woman from the village, but returned no more that night.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) simplicity, sensibility, and, perhaps more than he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) was aware, her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) beauty, had pleased and touched him (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) extremely. The idea of attaching a perfectly pure, disinterested, unpractised heart, was delightful to his (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) imagination: the cultivation of her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) understanding, he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) thought, would be an easy and a pleasing task: all difficulties vanished before his (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) sanguine hopes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sensibility,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) to himself, `is the parent of great talents and great virtues; and evidently she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) possesses natural feeling in an uncommon degree: it shall be developed with skill, patience, and delicacy; and I will deserve before I claim my reward.''

<p/>The next day he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) returned to the cottage, accompanied by an elderly lady, a Mrs Ormond; the same lady, who afterward to Marriott's prejudiced eyes, had appeared more like a dragon than any thing else, but who, to this simple, unsuspicious girl, seemed like what she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) really was, a truly good-natured, benevolent woman. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) consented, most readily, to put herself under the protection of Mrs Ormond, `provided Mrs Smith would give her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) leave.'' There was no difficulty in persuading Mrs Smith that it was for her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) advantage. Mrs Smith, who was a plain farmer's wife, told all that she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) knew of Rachel's history, but all that she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) knew was little. She (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) had heard only hints at odd times from the old woman: these, agreed perfectly with what Mr Hervey had already heard.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The old gentlewoman,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Smith/Smith</b></font>)</div>said Mrs Smith, `as I believe I should call her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) by rights, has lived in the forest there, where you found her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>), these many a year -- she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) earned her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) subsistance by tending bees and making rose-water -- she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) was a good soul, but very particular, especially about her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) grand-daughter, which, considering all things, one cannot blame her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) for. She (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) often told me she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) would never put Rachel to a boarding-school, which I approved, seeing she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) had no fortune; and it is the ruin of girls, to my mind, to be bred above their means -- as it was of her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) mother, sir. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) would never teach Rachel to write, for fear she (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) should take to scrawling nonsense of love-letters, as her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) mother did before her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>). Now, sir, this I approved too, for I don't much mind about book-learning myself; and I even thought it would have been as well if the girl had not learnt to read; but that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) did learn, and was always fond of, and I'm sure it was more plague than use too to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) grandmother, for she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was as particular about the books that the girl was to read as about all the rest. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) went farther than all that, sir; for she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) never would let the girl so much as speak to a man -- not a man ever entered the doors of the house.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) told me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) told you true enough. But there, I thought, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was quite wrong; for seeing the girl must, some time or other, speak to men, where was the use of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) not learning to do it properly? -- Lord, madam,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Smith/Smith</b></font>)</div>continued Mrs Smith, addressing herself to Mrs Ormond -- ``Lord! ma'am, though it is a sin to be remembering so much of the particulars of the dead, I must say there never was an old lady who had more scrupulosities than the deceased. I verily thought, one day, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) would have gone into fits about a picture of a man that Rachel lit upon by accident; as if a picture had any sense to hurt a body! Now if it had been one of your naked pictures, there might have been some decency in her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) dislike to it; but it was no such thing, but a very proper picture.

<p/>``A picture, ma'am, of a young sea-officer, in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) full uniform -- quite proper, ma'am. It was his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mother that left it with me, and I had it always in my own room, and the girl saw it, and was mightily taken with it, being the first thing of the kind she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had ever lit upon, and the old lady comes in, and took on, till I verily thought she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was crazed. Lord! I really could not but laugh; but I checked myself, when the poor old soul's eyes filled with tears, which made me know she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was thinking of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) daughter that was dead. When I thought on the cause of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) particularity about Rachel, I could not laugh any more at her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) strangeness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I promised the good lady that day, in case of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) death, to take care of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) grand-daughter; and I thought in my own mind that, in time to come, if one of my boys should take a fancy to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), I should make no objection, because she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was always a good, modest-behaved girl; and, I'm sure, would make a good wife, though too delicate for hard country work: but, as it pleases God, to send you madam, and the good gentleman, to take the charge of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) off my hands, I am content it should be so, and I will sell every thing here for her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) honestly, and bring it to you, madam, for poor Rachel.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Rachel</b></font>)</div><p/>There was nothing that Rachel was anxious to carry away with her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) but a little bullfinch, of which she (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) was very fond. One, and but one, circumstance about Rachel stopped the current of Clarence Hervey's imagination, and this, consequently, was excessively disagreeable to him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) -- her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) name: the name of Rachel he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) could not endure, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) thought it so unsuited to her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>), that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) could scarcely believe it belonged to her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) consequently resolved to change it as soon as possible. The first time that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) beheld her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) was struck with the idea that she (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) resembled the description of Virginia in M de St Pierre's celebrated romance; and by this name he (<font color='blue'><b>Pierre</b></font>) always called her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>), from the hour that she (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) quitted her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) cottage.

<p/>Mrs Ormond, the lady whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Pierre</b></font>) had engaged to take care of his (<font color='blue'><b>Pierre</b></font>) Virginia, was a widow, the mother of a gentleman who had been his (<font color='blue'><b>Pierre</b></font>) tutor at college. Her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) son died, and left her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) in such narrow circumstances, that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was obliged to apply to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) friends for pecuniary assistance.

<p/>Mr Hervey had been liberal in his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) contributions; from his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) childhood he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) had known her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) worth, and her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) attachment to him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) was blended with the most profound respect. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was not a woman of superior abilities, or of much information; but her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) excellent temper and gentle disposition won affection, though she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had not any talents to excite admiration. Mr Hervey had perfect confidence in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) integrity; he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) believed that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) would exactly comply with his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) directions, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) thought that her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) want of literature and ingenuity could easily be supplied by his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) own care and instructions. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) took a house for her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) fair pupil at Windsor, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) exacted a solemn promise that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) would neither receive nor pay any visits. Virginia was thus secluded from all intercourse with the world: she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) saw no one but Mrs Ormond, Clarence Hervey, and Mr Moreton, an elderly clergyman, whom Mr Hervey engaged to attend every Sunday to read prayers for them at home. Virginia never expressed the slightest curiosity to see any other persons, or any thing beyond the walls of the garden that belonged to the house in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) lived; her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) present retirement was not greater than that to which she (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) had long been accustomed, and consequently she (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) did not feel her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) seclusion from the world as any restraint: with the circumstances that were altered in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) situation she (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) seemed neither to be dazzled nor charmed; the objects of convenience or luxury that were new to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) looked upon with indifference, but with any thing that reminded her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) former way of life, and of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) grandmother's cottage, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) was delighted.

<p/>One day Mr Hervey asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>), whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) should like better to return to that cottage, or to remain where she (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) was? He (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) trembled for her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) answer. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) innocently replied, <div class="bookquote">``I should like best to go back to the cottage, if you would go with me -- but I would rather stay here with you than live there without you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>Clarence was touched and flattered by this artless answer, and for some time he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) discovered every day fresh indications, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) thought, of virtue and abilities in his (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) charming pupil. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) indifference to objects of show and ornament appeared to him (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) an indisputable proof of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) magnanimity, and of the superiority of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) unprejudiced mind. What a difference, thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>), between this child of nature and the frivolous, sophisticated slaves of art!

<p/>To try and prove the simplicity of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) taste, and the purity of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) mind, he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) once presented to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) a pair of diamond earrings and a moss rosebud, and asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) to take whichever she (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) liked best. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) eagerly snatched the rose, crying, <div class="bookquote">``Oh, it puts me in mind of the cottage: -- how sweet it smells!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) placed it in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) bosom, and then, looking at the diamonds, said, <div class="bookquote">``They are pretty sparkling things -- what are they? -- of what use are they?''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>and she (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) looked with more curiosity and admiration at the manner in which the earring shut and opened than at the diamonds. Clarence was charmed with her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>). When Mrs Ormond told her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) that these things were to hang in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) ears, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) laughed and said, <div class="bookquote">``How! how can I make them hang?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you never observed that I wear earrings?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Ormond/Ormond</b></font>)</div>said Mrs Ormond.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay! but yours are not like these -- and, let me look -- I never saw how you fastened them -- let me look -- oh! you have holes in your ears; but I have none in mine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Ormond/Ormond</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs Ormond told her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) that holes could easily be made in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) ears, by running a steel pin through them. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) shrunk back, defending her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) ear with one hand, and pushing the diamonds from her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) with the other, exclaiming, <div class="bookquote">``Oh, no, no! -- unless,''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>added she (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>), changing her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) tone, and turning to Clarence, `unless you wish it: -- if you bid me, I will.''

<p/>Clarence was scarcely master of himself at this instant; and it was with the utmost difficulty that he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) could reply to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) with that dispassionate calmness which became his (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) situation and hers. And yet there was more of ignorance and timidity, perhaps, than of sound sense or philosophy in Virginia's indifference to diamonds; she (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) did not consider them as ornaments that would confer distinction upon their possessor, because she (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) was ignorant of the value affixed to them by society. Isolated in the world, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) had no excitements to the love of finery, no competition, no means of comparison, or opportunities of display; diamonds were consequently as useless to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) as guineas were to Robinson Crusoe on his (<font color='blue'><b>Robinson</b></font>) desert island. It could not justly be said that he (<font color='blue'><b>Robinson</b></font>) was free from avarice, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Robinson</b></font>) set no value on the gold; or that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) was free from vanity, because she (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) rejected the diamonds. These reflections could not possibly have escaped a man of Clarence Hervey's abilities; had he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) not been engaged in defence of a favourite system of education, or if his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) pupil had not been quite so handsome. Virginia's absolute ignorance of the world frequently gave an air of originality to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) most trivial observations, which made her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) appear at once interesting and entertaining. All her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) ideas of happiness were confined to the life she (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) had led during her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) childhood; and as she (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) had accidentally lived in a beautiful situation in the New Forest, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) appeared to have an instinctive taste for the beauties of nature, and for what we call the picturesque. This taste Mr Hervey perceived, whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) showed her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) prints and drawings, and it was a fresh source of delight and self-complacency to him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>). All that was amiable or estimable in Virginia had a double charm, from the secret sense of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) penetration, in having discovered and appreciated the treasure. The affections of this innocent girl had no object but himself and Mrs Ormond, and they were strong, perhaps, in proportion as they were concentrated. The artless familiarity of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) manner, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) unsuspicious confidence, amounting almost to credulity, had irresistible power over Mr Hervey's mind; he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) felt them as appeals at once to his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) tenderness and his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) generosity. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) treated her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) with the utmost delicacy, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) oath was never absent from his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) mind: but he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) felt proudly convinced, that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) had not been bound by any such solemn engagement, no temptation could have made him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) deceive and betray confiding innocence.

<p/>Conscious that his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) views were honourable, anticipating the generous pleasure he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) should have in showing his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) superiority to all mercenary considerations and worldly prejudices, in the choice of a wife, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) indulged, with a species of pride, his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) increasing attachment to Virginia; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) was not sensible of the rapid progress of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) passion, till he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) was suddenly awakened by a few simple observations of Mrs Ormond.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This is Virginia's birthday -- she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) tells me she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) is seventeen to-day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Seventeen! -- is she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) only seventeen?''  (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div>cried Clarence, with a mixture of surprise and disappointment in his (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) countenance -- <div class="bookquote">``Only seventeen! -- Why she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) is but a child still.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Quite, a child,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Ormond/Ormond</b></font>)</div>said Mrs Ormond, `and so much the better.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So much the worse, I think,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div>said Clarence. <div class="bookquote">``But are you sure she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>)'s only seventeen? -- she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) must be mistaken -- she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) must be eighteen, at least.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``God forbid!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``God forbid! -- Why, Mrs Ormond?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because, you know, we have a year more before us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That may be a very satisfactory prospect to you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div>said Mr Hervey, smiling.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And to you, surely,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Ormond/Ormond</b></font>)</div>said Mrs Ormond; `for, I suppose, you would be glad that your wife should, at least, know the common things that every body knows.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``As to that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div>said Clarence, <div class="bookquote">``I should be glad that my wife were ignorant of what every body knows. Nothing is so tiresome to a man of any taste or abilities, as what every body knows. I am rather desirous to have a wife who has an uncommon than a common understanding.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you would choose, would not you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Ormond/Ormond</b></font>)</div>said Mrs Ormond, hesitating with an air of great deference, `that your wife should know how to write?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``To be sure,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div>replied Clarence, colouring. <div class="bookquote">``Does not Virginia know how to write?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How should she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Ormond/Ormond</b></font>)</div>said Mrs Ormond: `it is no fault of hers, poor girl -- she (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) was never taught. You know it was her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) grandmother's notion that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) should not learn to write, lest she (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) should write love-letters.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But you promised that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) should be taught to write, and I trusted to you, Mrs Ormond.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) has been here only two months, and all that time, I am sure, I have done every thing in my power; but when a person comes to be sixteen or seventeen, it is up-hill work.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will teach her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) myself,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div>cried Clarence. <div class="bookquote">``I am sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) may be taught any thing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``By you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Ormond/Ormond</b></font>)</div>said Mrs Ormond, smiling; `but not by me.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You have no doubts of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) capacity, surely?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am no judge of capacity, especially of the capacity of those I love, and I am grown very fond of Virginia; she (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) is a charming, open-hearted, simple, affectionate creature. I rather think it is from indolence that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) does not learn, and not from want of abilities.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``All indolence arises from want of excitement,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div>said Clarence: `if she (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) had proper motives, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) would conquer her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) indolence.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, I dare say, if I were to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) would never have a letter from Mr Hervey till she (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) is able to write an answer, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) would learn to write very expeditiously; but I thought that would not be a proper motive, because you forbade me to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) your future views. And indeed it would be highly imprudent, on your account, as well as hers, to give her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) any hint of that kind; because you might change your mind, before she (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>)'s old enough for you to think of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) seriously, and then you would not know what to do with her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>); and after entertaining hopes of becoming your wife, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) would be miserable, I am sure, with that affectionate tender heart of hers, if you were to leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>). Now that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) knows nothing of the matter, we are all safe, and as we should be.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div><p/>Though Clarence Hervey did not at this time foresee any great probability of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) changing his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) mind, yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) felt the good sense and justice of Mrs Ormond's suggestions; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) was alarmed to perceive that his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) mind had been so intoxicated as to suffer such obvious reflections to escape his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) attention. Mrs Ormond, a woman whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) had been accustomed to consider as far his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) inferior in capacity, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) now felt was superior to him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) in prudence, merely because she (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) was undisturbed by passion. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) resolved to master his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) own mind: to consider that it was not a mistress, but a wife he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) wanted in Virginia; that a wife without capacity or without literature could never be a companion suited to him (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>), let her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) beauty or sensibility be ever so exquisite and captivating. The happiness of his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) life and of hers were at stake, and every motive of prudence and delicacy called upon him (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) to command his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) affections. He (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) was, however, still sanguine in his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) expectations from Virginia's understanding, and from his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) own power of developing her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) capacity. He (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) made several attempts, with the greatest skill and patience; and his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) fair pupil, though she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) did not by any means equal his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) hopes, astonished Mrs Ormond by her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) comparatively rapid progress.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I always believed that you could make her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) any thing you pleased,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``You are a tutor who can work miracles with Virginia.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I see no miracles,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div>replied Clarence; <div class="bookquote">``I am conscious of no such power. I should be sorry to possess any such influence, until I am sure that it would be for our mutual happiness.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr Hervey then conjured Mrs Ormond, by all her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) attachment to him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) and to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) pupil never to give Virginia the most distant idea that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) had any intentions of making her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) wife. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) promised to do all that was in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) power to keep this secret, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) could not help observing that it had already been betrayed, as plainly as looks could speak, by Mr Hervey himself. Clarence in vain endeavoured to exculpate himself from this charge: Mrs Ormond brought to his (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) recollection so many instances of his (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) indiscretion, that it was substantiated even in his (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) own judgment, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) was amazed to find that all the time he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) had put so much constraint upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) inclinations, he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) had, nevertheless, so obviously betrayed them. His (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) surprise, however, was at this time unmixed with any painful regret; he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) did not foresee the probability that he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) should change his (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) mind; and notwithstanding Mrs Ormond assured him (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) that Virginia's sensibility had increased, he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) was persuaded that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) was mistaken, and that his (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) pupil's heart and imagination were yet untouched. The innocent openness with which she (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) expressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) affection for him (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) confirmed him (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) said, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) opinion. To do him (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) justice, Clarence had none of the presumption which too often characterizes men who have been successful, as it is called, with the fair sex. His (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) acquaintance with women had increased his (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) persuasion that it is difficult to excite genuine love in the heart; and with respect to himself, he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) was upon this subject astonishingly incredulous. It was scarcely possible to convince him (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) was beloved.

<p/>Mrs Ormond, piqued upon this subject, determined to ascertain more decisively her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) pupil's sentiments.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>), one day to Virginia, who was feeding her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) bullfinch, <div class="bookquote">``I do believe you are fonder of that bird than of any thing in the world -- fonder of it, I am sure, than of me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! you cannot think so,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Virginia, with an affectionate smile.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well! fonder than you are of Mr Hervey, you will allow, at least?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, indeed!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>cried she (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>), eagerly: `how can you think me so foolish, so childish, so ungrateful, as to prefer a little worthless bird to him (<font color='blue'><b>pupil</b></font>) -- ' -LRB-the bullfinch began to sing so loud at this instant, that her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) enthusiastic speech was stopped-RRB-. <div class="bookquote">``My pretty bird,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>), as it perched upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) hand, <div class="bookquote">``I love you very much, but if Mr Hervey were to ask it, to wish it, I would open that window, and let you fly; yes, and bid you fly away far from me for ever. Perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) does wish it? -- Does he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>)? -- Did he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) tell you so?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>cried she (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>), looking earnestly in Mrs Ormond's face, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) moved towards the window.

<p/>Mrs Ormond put her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) hand upon the sash, as Virginia was going to throw it up --

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Gently, gently, my love -- whither is your imagination carrying you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Ormond/Ormond</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought something by your look,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Virginia, blushing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And I thought something, my dear Virginia,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Ormond/Ormond</b></font>)</div>said Mrs Ormond, smiling.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What did you think? -- What could you think?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I cannot -- I mean, I would rather not at present tell you. But do not look so grave; I will tell you some time or other, if you cannot guess.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Virginia was silent, and stood abashed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sure, my sweet girl,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Ormond/Ormond</b></font>)</div>said Mrs Ormond, <div class="bookquote">``I do not mean, by any thing I said, to confuse or blame you. It is very natural that you should be grateful to Mr Hervey, and that you should admire, and, to a certain degree, love him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Ormond/Ormond</b></font>)</div><p/>Virginia looked up delighted, yet with some hesitation in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) manner.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) is, indeed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Ormond/Ormond</b></font>)</div>said Mrs Ormond, `one of the first of human beings: such even I have always thought him (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>); and I am sure, I like you the better, my dear, for your sensibility,<div class="bookquote">'' said she (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>), kissing Virginia as she (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) spoke; `only we must take care of it, or this tenderness might go too far.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How so?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Virginia, returning her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) caresses with fondness: `can I love you and Mr Hervey too much?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nor him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>), I'm sure -- he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) is so good, so very good! I am afraid that I do not love him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) enough,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>), sighing. <div class="bookquote">``I love him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) enough when he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) is absent, but not when he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) is present. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) is near I feel a sort of fear mixed with my love. I wish to please him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) very much, but I should not quite like that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) should show his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) love for me as you do -- as you did just now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear, it would not be proper that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) should; you are quite right not to wish it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Am I? I was afraid that it was a sign of my not liking him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) as much as I ought.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, my poor child! you love him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) full as much as you ought.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you think so? I am glad of it,''  (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div>said Virginia, with a look of such confiding simplicity, that her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) friend was touched to the heart.

<p/>'l do think so, my love,<div class="bookquote">'' said Mrs Ormond; `and I hope I shall never be sorry for it, nor you either. But it is not proper that we should say any more upon this subject now. Where are your drawings? Where is your writing? My dear, we must get forward with these things as fast as we can. That is the way to please Mr Hervey, I can tell you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Ormond/Ormond</b></font>)</div><p/>Confirmed by this conversation in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) own opinion, Mrs Ormond was satisfied. From delicacy to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) pupil, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) did not repeat all that had passed to Mr Hervey, resolving to wait till the proper moment. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>child</b></font>) is too young and too childish for him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) to think of marrying her (<font color='blue'><b>child</b></font>) yet, for a year or two,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>); `and it is better to repress her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) sensibility till her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) education is more finished; by that time Mr Hervey will find out his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) mistake.''

<p/>In the mean time she (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) could not help thinking that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) was blind, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) continued steady in his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) belief of Virginia's indifference.

<p/>To dissipate his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) own mind, and to give time for the development of hers, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) now, according to his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) resolution, left his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) pupil to the care of Mrs Ormond, and mixed as much as possible in gay and fashionable company. It was at this period that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) renewed his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) acquaintance with Lady Delacour, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) had seen and admired before he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) went abroad. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) found that his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) gallantry, on the famous day of the battle between the turkeys and pigs, was still remembered with gratitude by her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) ladyship; she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) received him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) with marked courtesy, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) soon became a constant visitor at her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) house. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) wit entertained, her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) eloquence charmed him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) followed, admired, and gallanted her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>), without scruple, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) considered her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) merely as a coquette, who preferred the glory of conquest to the security of reputation. With such a woman he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) could amuse himself without danger, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) every where appeared the foremost in the public train of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) ladyship's admirers. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) soon discovered, however, that her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) talents were far superior to what are necessary for playing the part of a fine lady; his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) visits became more and more agreeable to him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) was glad to feel, that, by dividing his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) attention, his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) passion for Virginia insensibly diminished, or, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) said to himself, became more reasonable. In conversing with Lady Delacour, his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) faculties were always called into full play; in talking to Virginia, his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) understanding was passive: he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) perceived that a large proportion of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) intellectual powers, and of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) knowledge, was absolutely useless to him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) company; and this did not raise her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) either in his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) love or esteem. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) simplicity and naiveté, however, sometimes relieved him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>), after he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) had been fatigued by the extravagant gaiety and glare of her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) ladyship's manners; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) reflected that the coquetry which amused him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) in an acquaintance would be odious in a wife: the perfect innocence of Virginia promised security to his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) domestic happiness, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) did not change his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) views, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) was less eager for the period of their accomplishment. <div class="bookquote">``I cannot expect every thing that is desirable,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) to himself: 'a more brilliant character than Virginia's would excite my admiration, but could not command my confidence.''

<p/>It was whilst his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) mind was in this situation that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) became acquainted with Belinda. At first, the idea of her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) having been educated by the match-making Mrs Stanhope prejudiced him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) against her (<font color='blue'><b>Stanhope</b></font>); but as he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) had opportunities of observing her (<font color='blue'><b>Stanhope</b></font>) conduct, this prepossession was conquered, and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Stanhope</b></font>) had secured his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) esteem, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) could no longer resist her (<font color='blue'><b>Stanhope</b></font>) power over his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) heart. In comparison with Belinda, Virginia appeared to him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) but an insipid, though innocent child: the one he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) found was his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) equal, the other his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) inferior; the one he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) saw could be a companion, a friend to him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) for life, the other would merely be his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) pupil, or his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) plaything. Belinda had cultivated taste, an active understanding, a knowledge of literature, the power and the habit of conducting herself; Virginia was ignorant and indolent, she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) had few ideas, and no wish to extend her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) knowledge; she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) was so entirely unacquainted with the world, that it was absolutely impossible she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) could conduct herself with that discretion, which must be the combined result of reasoning and experience. Mr Hervey had felt gratuitous confidence in Virginia's innocence; but on Belinda's prudence, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) had opportunities of seeing tried, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) gradually learned to feel a different and a higher species of reliance, which it is neither in our power to bestow nor to refuse. The virtues of Virginia sprang from sentiment; those of Belinda from reason.

<p/>Clarence, whilst he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) made all these comparisons, became every day more wisely and more fondly attached to Belinda; and at length he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) became desirous to change the nature of his (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) connexion with Virginia, and to appear to her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) only in the light of a friend or a benefactor. He (<font color='blue'><b>benefactor</b></font>) thought of giving her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) a suitable fortune and of leaving her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) under the care of Mrs Ormond, till some method of establishing her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) in the world should occur. Unfortunately, just at the time when Mr Hervey formed this plan, and before it was communicated to Mrs Ormond, difficulties arose which prevented him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) from putting it into execution.

<p/>Whilst he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) had been engaged in the gay world at Lady Delacour's, his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) pupil had necessarily been left much to the management of Mrs Ormond. This lady, with the best possible intentions, had not that reach of mind and variety of resource necessary to direct the exquisite sensibility and ardent imagination of Virginia: the solitude in which she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) lived added to the difficulty of the task. Without companions to interest her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) social affections, without real objects to occupy her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) senses and understanding, Virginia's mind was either perfectly indolent, or exalted by romantic views, and visionary ideas of happiness. As she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had never seen any thing of society, all her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) notions were drawn from books; the severe restrictions which her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) grand-mother had early laid upon the choice of these seemed to have awakened her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) curiosity, and to have increased her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) appetite for books -- it was insatiable. Reading, indeed, was now almost her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) only pleasure; for Mrs Ormond's conversation was seldom entertaining, and Virginia had no longer those occupations which filled a portion of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) day at the cottage.

<p/>Mr Hervey had cautioned Mrs Ormond against putting common novels into her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) hands, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) made no objection to romances: these, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) thought, breathed a spirit favourable to female virtue, exalted the respect for chastity, and inspired enthusiastic admiration of honour, generosity, truth, and all the noble qualities which dignify human nature. Virginia devoured these romances with the greatest eagerness; and Mrs Ormond, who found her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) a prey to ennui when her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) fancy was not amused, indulged her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) taste; yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) strongly suspected that they contributed to increase her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) passion for the only man who could, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) imagination, represent a hero.

<p/>One night Virginia found, in Mrs Ormond's room, a volume of St Pierre's Paul and Virginia. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) knew that her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) own name had been taken from this romance; Mr Hervey had her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) picture painted in this character; and these circumstances strongly excited her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) curiosity to read the book. Mrs Ormond could not refuse to let her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) have it; for, though it was not an ancient romance, it did not exactly come under the description of a common novel, and Mr Hervey was not at hand to give his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) advice. Virginia sat down instantly to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) volume, and never stirred from the spot till she (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) had nearly finished it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is it that strikes your fancy so much? What are you considering so deeply, my love?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Ormond/Ormond</b></font>)</div>said Mrs Ormond, observing that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) seemed lost in thought. <div class="bookquote">``Let us see, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>continued she (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>), offering to take the book, which hung from her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) hand. Virginia started from her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) reverie, but held the volume fast. -- <div class="bookquote">``Will not you let me read along with you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Ormond/Ormond</b></font>)</div>said Mrs Ormond. <div class="bookquote">``Won't you let me share your pleasure?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It was not pleasure that I felt, I believe,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Virginia. <div class="bookquote">``I would rather you should not see just that particular part that I was reading; and yet, if you desire it,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>added she (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>), resigning the book reluctantly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What can make you so much afraid of me, my sweet girl?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not afraid of you -- but -- of myself,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Ormond/Ormond</b></font>)</div>said Virginia, sighing. Mrs Ormond read the following passage:


<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) thought of Paul's friendship, more pure than the waters of the fountain, stronger than the united palms, and sweeter than the perfume of flowers; and these images, in night and in solitude, gave double force to the passion which she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) nourished in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) heart. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) suddenly left the dangerous shades, and went to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) mother, to seek protection against herself. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) wished to reveal her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) distress to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) pressed her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) hands, and the name of Paul was on her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) lips; but the oppression of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) heart took away all utterance, and, laying her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) head upon her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) mother's bosom, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) only wept.''


 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Ormond/Ormond</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And am I not a mother to you, my beloved Virginia?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Ormond/Ormond</b></font>)</div>said Mrs Ormond. <div class="bookquote">``Though I cannot express my affection in such charming language as this, yet, believe me, no mother was ever fonder of a child.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Ormond/Ormond</b></font>)</div><p/>Virginia threw her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) arms round Mrs Ormond, and laid her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) head upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) friend's bosom, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) wished to realize the illusion, and to be the Virginia of whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) had been reading.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I know all you think, and all you feel: I know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Ormond/Ormond</b></font>)</div>whispered Mrs Ormond, `the name that is on your lips.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, indeed, you do not; you cannot,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Ormond/Ormond</b></font>)</div>cried Virginia, suddenly raising her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) head, and looking up in Mrs Ormond's face, with surprise and timidity: `how could you possibly know all my thoughts and feelings? I never told them to you; for, indeed, I have only confused ideas floating in my imagination from the books I have been reading. I do not distinctly know my own feelings.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This is all very natural, and a proof of your perfect innocence and simplicity, my child. But why did the passage you were reading just now strike you so much?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I was only considering,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Virginia, `whether it was the description of -- love.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And your heart told you that it was?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>), sighing. <div class="bookquote">``But of this I am certain, that I had not the name, which you were thinking of upon my lips.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Ah! thought Mrs Ormond, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) has not forgotten how I checked her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) sensibility some time ago. Poor girl! she (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) is become afraid of me, and I have taught her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) to dissemble; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) betrays herself every moment.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Ormond/Ormond</b></font>)</div>said Mrs Ormond, `you need not fear me -- I cannot blame you: in your situation, it is impossible that you could help loving Mr Hervey.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; quite impossible. So do not blame yourself for it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I do not blame myself for that. I only blame myself for not loving him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) enough, as I told you once before.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, my dear; and the oftener you tell me so, the more I am convinced of your affection. It is one of the strongest symptoms of love, that we are unconscious of its extent. We fancy that we can never do too much for the beloved object.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is exactly what I feel about Mr Hervey.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That we can never love him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) enough.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! that is precisely what I feel for Mr Hervey.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And what you ought -- I mean, what it is natural you should feel; and what he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) will himself; I hope, indeed I daresay, some time or other wish, and be glad that you should feel.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Some time or other? Does not he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) wish it now?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I -- he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) -- my dear, what a question is that? And how shall I answer it? We must judge of what he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) feels by what he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) expresses: when he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) expresses love for you, it will then be the time to show yours for him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) has always expressed love for me, I think,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Virginia -- `always, till lately,<div class="bookquote">'' continued she (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>); `but lately he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) has been away so much, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) comes home, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) does not look so well pleased; so that I was afraid he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) was angry with me, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) thought me ungrateful.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, my love, do not torment yourself with these vain fears! And yet I know that you cannot help it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Since you are so kind, so very kind to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Virginia, <div class="bookquote">``I will tell you all my fears and doubts.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not at all sleepy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Ormond/Ormond</b></font>)</div>said the indulgent Mrs Ormond.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nor I,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Virginia.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Ormond/Ormond</b></font>)</div>said Mrs Ormond, `for these doubts and fears.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I was afraid that, perhaps, Mr Hervey would he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) angry if he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) knew that I thought of any thing in the world but him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of what else do you think? -- Of nothing else from morning till night, that I can see.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, then you do not see into my mind. In the daytime I often think of those heroes, those charming heroes, that I read of in the books you have given me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To be sure you do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And is not that wrong? Would not Mr Hervey be displeased if he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) knew it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why should he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because they are not quite like him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>).

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Ormond/Ormond</b></font>)</div><p/>How naturally love inspires the idea of jealousy, thought Mrs Ormond. <div class="bookquote">``My dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>), `you carry your ideas of delicacy and gratitude to an extreme; but it is very natural you should: however, you need not be afraid; Mr Hervey cannot be jealous of those charming heroes, that never existed, though they are not quite like him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>).''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am very glad that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) would not think me ungrateful -- but if he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) knew that I dream of them sometimes?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) would think you dreamed, as all people do, of what they think of in the daytime.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``And he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) would not be angry? I am very glad of it. But I once saw a picture -- '

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I know you did -- well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Ormond/Ormond</b></font>)</div>said Mrs Ormond, `and your grandmother was frightened because it was the picture of a man -- hey? If she (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) was not your grandmother, I should say that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) was a simpleton. I assure you, Mr Hervey is not like her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>), if that is what you mean to ask. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) would not be angry at your having seen fifty pictures.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am glad of it -- but I see it very often in my dreams.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, if you had seen more pictures, you would not see this so often. It was the first you ever saw, and very naturally you remember it. Mr Hervey would not be angry at that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Ormond/Ormond</b></font>)</div>said Mrs Ormond, laughing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But sometimes, in my dreams, it speaks to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And what does it say?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The same sort of things that those heroes I read of say to their mistresses.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And do you never, in your dreams, hear Mr Hervey say this sort of things?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And do you never see Mr Hervey in these dreams?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sometimes; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) does not speak to me; he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) does not look at me with the same sort of tenderness, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) does not throw himself at my feet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; because he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) has never done all this in reality.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; and I wonder how I come to dream of such things.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So do I; but you have read and thought of them, it is plain. Now go to sleep, there's my good girl; that is the best thing you can do at present -- go to sleep.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Philip Baddely</b></font>)</div><p/>It was not long after this conversation that Sir Philip Baddely and Mr Rochfort scaled the garden wall, to obtain a sight of Clarence Hervey's mistress. Virginia was astonished, terrified, and disgusted, by their appearance; they seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) a species of animals for which she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) had no name, and of which she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) had no prototype in her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) imagination. That they were men she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) saw; but they were clearly not Clarence Herveys; they bore still less resemblance to the courteous knights of chivalry. Their language was so different from any of the books she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) had read, and any of the conversations she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) had heard, that they were scarcely intelligible. After they had forced themselves into her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) presence, they did not scruple to address her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) in the most unceremonious manner. Amongst other rude things, they said, <div class="bookquote">``Damme, my pretty dear, you cannot love the man that keeps you prisoner in this manner, hey? Damme, you'd better come and live with one of us. You can't love this tyrant of a fellow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) is not a tyrant -- I do love him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) as much as I detest you,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>cried Virginia, shrinking from him (<font color='blue'><b>Herveys</b></font>) with looks of horror.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Damme! good actress! Put her (<font color='blue'><b>actress</b></font>) on the stage when he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) is tired of her (<font color='blue'><b>actress</b></font>). So you won't come with us? -- Good bye, till we see you again. You're right, my girl, to be upon your good behaviour; may be you may get him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) to marry you, child!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/>Virginia, upon hearing this speech, turned from the man who insulted her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) with a degree of haughty indignation, of which her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) gentle nature had never before appeared capable.

<p/>Mrs Ormond hoped, that after the alarm was over, the circumstance would pass away from her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) pupil's mind; but on the contrary, it left the most forcible impression. Virginia became silent and melancholy, and whole hours were spent in reverie. Mrs Ormond imagined, that notwithstanding Virginia's entire ignorance of the world, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) had acquired from books sufficient knowledge to be alarmed at the idea of being taken for Clarence Hervey's mistress. She (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) touched upon this subject with much delicacy, and the answers that she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) received confirmed her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) opinion. Virginia had been inspired by romances with the most exalted notions of female delicacy and honour! but from her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) perfect ignorance, these were rather vague ideas than principles of conduct.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We shall see Mr Hervey to-morrow; he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) has written me word that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) will come from town, and spend the day with us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall be ashamed to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) after what has passed,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Virginia.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You have no cause for shame, my dear; Mr Hervey will try to discover the persons who insulted you, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) will punish them. They will never return here; you need not fear that. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) is willing and able to protect you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Yes, of that I am sure. But what did that strange man mean, when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said -- '

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What, my dear?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That, perhaps, Mr Hervey would marry me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Virginia pronounced these words with difficulty. Mrs Ormond was silent, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) was much embarrassed. Virginia having conquered her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) first difficulty, seemed resolute to obtain an answer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You do not speak to me! Will you not tell me, dear Mrs Ormond,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>), hanging upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) fondly, `what did he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) mean?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) said, I suppose.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) said, that if I behaved well, I might get Mr Hervey to marry me. What did he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) mean by that?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Virginia, in an accent of offended pride.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) spoke very rudely and improperly; but it is not worth while to think of what he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) said, or what he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) meant.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But, dear Mrs Ormond, do not go away from me now: I never so much wished to speak to you in my whole life, and you turn away from me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, my love, well, what would you say?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell me one thing, only one thing, and you will set my heart at ease. Does Mr Hervey wish me to be his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) wife?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I cannot tell you that, my dearest Virginia. Time will show us. Perhaps his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) heart has not yet decided.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish it would decide,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said Virginia, sighing deeply; `and I wish that strange man had not told me any thing about the matter; it has made me very unhappy.''

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) covered her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) eyes with her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) hand, but the tears trickled between her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) fingers, and rolled fast down her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) arms. Mrs Ormond, quite overcome by the sight of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) distress, was no longer able to keep the secret with which she (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) had been entrusted by Clarence Hervey. And after all, thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>), Virginia will hear it from himself soon. I shall only spare her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) some unnecessary pain; it is cruel to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) thus, and to keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) in suspense. Besides, her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) weakness might be her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) ruin, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) opinion, if it were to extinguish all her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) energy, and deprive her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) of the very power of pleasing. How wan she (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) looks, and how heavy are those sleepless eyes! She (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) is not, indeed, in a condition to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>), when he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) comes to us to-morrow: if she (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) had some hopes, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) would revive and appear with her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) natural ease and grace.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My sweet child,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Ormond/Ormond</b></font>)</div>said Mrs Ormond, <div class="bookquote">``I cannot bear to see you so melancholy; consider, Mr Hervey will be with us to-morrow, and it will give him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) a great deal of pain to see you so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Ormond/Ormond</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Will it? Then I will try to be very gay.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Ormond/Ormond</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs Ormond was so delighted to see Virginia smile, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) could not forbear adding, <div class="bookquote">``The strange man was not wrong in every thing he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said; you will, one of these days, be Mr Hervey's wife.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That, I am sure,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said Virginia, bursting again into tears, `that, I am sure, I do not wish, unless he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) does.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) does, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) does, my dear -- do not let this delicacy of yours, which has been wound up too high, make you miserable. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) thought of you, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) loved you long and long ago.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) is very good, too good,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Virginia, sobbing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, what is more -- for I can keep nothing from you -- he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) has been educating you all this time on purpose for his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) wife, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) only waits till your education is finished, and till he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) is sure that you feel no repugnance for him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should be very ungrateful if I felt any repugnance for him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Virgina; <div class="bookquote">``I feel none.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, that you need not assure me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Ormond/Ormond</b></font>)</div>said Mrs Ormond.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But I do not wish to marry him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) -- I do not wish to marry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are a modest girl to say so; and this modesty will make you ten times more amiable, especially in Mr Hervey's eyes. Heaven forbid that I should lessen it!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Ormond/Ormond</b></font>)</div><p/>The next morning Virginia, who always slept in the same room with Mrs Ormond, wakened her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>), by crying out in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) sleep, with a voice of terror, <div class="bookquote">``Oh, save him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>)! -- save Mr Hervey! -- Mr Hervey! -- forgive me! forgive me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs Ormond drew back the curtain, and saw Virginia lying fast asleep; her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) beautiful face convulsed with agony.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>)'s dead! -- Mr Hervey!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>cried she (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>), in a voice of exquisite distress: then starting up, and stretching out her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) arms, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) uttered a piercing cry, and awoke.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My love, you have been dreaming frightfully,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Ormond/Ormond</b></font>)</div>said Mrs Ormond.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it all a dream?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>cried Virginia, looking round fearfully.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``All a dream, my dear!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Ormond/Ormond</b></font>)</div>said Mrs Ormond, taking her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am very, very glad of it! -- Let me breathe. It was, indeed, a frightful dream!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Your hand still trembles,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Ormond/Ormond</b></font>)</div>said Mrs Ormond; `let me put back this hair from your poor face, and you will grow cool, and forget this foolish dream.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No; I must tell it you. I ought to tell it you. But it was all so confused, I can recollect only some parts of it. First, I remember that I thought I was not myself but the Virginia that we were reading of the other night; and I was somewhere in the Isle of France. I thought the place was something like the forest where my grandmother's cottage used to be, only there were high mountains and rocks, and cocoa-trees and plantains.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Such as you saw in the prints of that book?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; only beautiful, beautiful beyond description! And it was moonlight, brighter and clearer than any moonlight I ever before had seen; and the air was fresh yet perfumed; and I was seated under the shade of a plane-tree, beside Virginia's fountain.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Just as you are in your picture?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes: but Paul was seated beside me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Paul!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Ormond/Ormond</b></font>)</div>said Mrs Ormond, smiling: `that is Mr Hervey.''

<p/>``No; not Mr Hervey's face, though it spoke with his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) voice -- this is what I thought that I must tell you. It was another figure: it seemed a real living person: it knelt at my feet, and spoke to me so kindly, so tenderly; and just as it was going to kiss my hand, Mr Hervey appeared, and I started terribly, for I was afraid he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) would be displeased, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) would think me ungrateful; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) was displeased, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) called me ungrateful Virginia, and frowned, and then I gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) my hand, and then every thing changed, I do not know how suddenly, and I was in a place like the great print of the cathedral, which Mr Hervey showed me; and there were crowds of people -- I was almost stifled. You pulled me on, as I remember; and Mr Moreton was there, standing upon some steps by what you called the altar; and then we knelt down before him (<font color='blue'><b>Moreton</b></font>), and Mr Hervey was putting a ring on my finger; but there came suddenly from the crowd that strange man, who was here the other day, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) dragged me along with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), I don't know how or where, swiftly down precipices, whilst I struggled, and at last fell. Then all changed again, and I was in a magnificent field, covered with cloth of gold, and there were beautiful ladies seated under canopies; and I thought it was a tournament, such as I have read of, only more splendid; and two knights, clad in complete armour, and mounted on fiery steeds, were engaged in single combat; and they fought furiously, and I thought they were fighting for me. One of the knights wore black plumes in his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) helmet, and the other white; and, as he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) was passing by me, the vizor of the knight of the white plumes was raised, and I saw it was -- '

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Clarence Hervey?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Ormond/Ormond</b></font>)</div>said Mrs Ormond.

<p/>``No; still the same figure that knelt to me; and I wished him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) to be victorious. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) was victorious. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) unhorsed his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) adversary, and stood over him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) drawn sword; and then I saw that the knight in the black plumes was Mr Hervey, and I ran to save him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>), but I could not. I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) weltering in his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) blood, and I heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) say, ``Perfidious, ungrateful Virginia! you are the cause of my death!<div class="bookquote">'' -- and I screamed, I believe, and that awakened me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, it is only a dream, my love,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Ormond/Ormond</b></font>)</div>said Mrs Ormond; <div class="bookquote">``Mr Hervey is safe: get up and dress yourself and you will soon see him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Ormond/Ormond</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But was it not wrong and ungrateful to wish that the knight in the white plumes should be victorious?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Your poor little head is full of nothing but these romances, and love for Mr Hervey. It is your love for him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) that makes you fear that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) will be jealous, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) is not so simple as you are. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) will forgive you for wishing that the knight in the white plumes should be victorious, especially as you did not know that the other knight was Mr Hervey.

 (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER XXVII

<p/>A Discovery

<p/>INSTEAD of the open, childish, affectionate familiarity with which Virginia used to meet Clarence Hervey, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) now received him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) with reserved, timid embarrassment. Struck by this change in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) manner, and alarmed by the dejection of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) spirits, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) vainly strove to conceal, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) eagerly inquired, from Mrs Ormond, into the cause of this alteration.

<p/>Mrs Ormond's answers, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) account of all that had passed during his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) absence, increased his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) anxiety. His (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) indignation was roused by the insult which Virginia had been offered by the strangers who had scaled the garden-wall. All his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) endeavours to discover who they were proved ineffectual; but, lest they should venture to repeat their visit, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) removed her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) from Windsor, and took her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) directly to Twickenham. Here he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) stayed with her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) and Mrs Ormond some days, to determine, by his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) own observation, how far the representations that had been made to him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) were just. Till this period he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) had been persuaded that Virginia's regard for him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) was rather that of gratitude than of love; and with this opinion, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) thought that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) had no reason seriously to reproach himself for the imprudence with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) had betrayed the partiality that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) felt for her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) in the beginning of their acquaintance. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) flattered himself that even should she (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) have discerned his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) intentions, her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) heart would not repine at any alteration in his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) sentiments; and if her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) happiness were uninjured, his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) reason told him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) was not in honour bound to constancy. The case was now altered. Unwilling as he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) was to believe, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) could no longer doubt. Virginia could neither meet his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) eyes nor speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) without a degree of embarrassment which she (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) had not sufficient art to conceal: she (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) trembled whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) came near her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>), and if he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) looked grave, or forbore to take notice of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) would burst into tears. At other times, contrary to the natural indolence of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) character, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) would exert herself to please him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) with surprising energy: she (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) learned every thing that he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) wished; her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) capacity seemed suddenly to unfold. For an instant, Clarence flattered himself' that both her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) fits of melancholy and of exertion might arise from a secret desire to see something of that world from which she (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) had been secluded. One day he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) touched upon this subject, to see what effect it would produce; but, contrary to his (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) expectations, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) seemed to have no desire to quit her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) retirement: she (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) did not wish, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) said, for amusements such as he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) described; she (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) did not wish to go into the world.

<p/>It was during the time of his (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) passion for her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) that Clarence had her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) picture painted in the character of St Pierre's Virginia. It happened to be in the room in which they were now conversing, and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) spoke of loving a life of retirement, Clarence accidentally cast his (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) eyes upon the picture, and then upon Virginia. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) turned away -- sighed deeply; and when, in a tone of kindness, he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) if she (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) were unhappy, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) hid her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) face in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) hands, and made no answer.

<p/>Mr Hervey could not be insensible to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) distress or to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) delicacy. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) bloom fading daily, her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) spirits depressed, her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) existence a burden to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) feared that his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) own imprudence had been the cause of all this misery.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have taken her (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) out of a situation in which she (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) might have spent her (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) life usefully and happily; I have excited false hopes in her (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) mind, and now she (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) is a wretched and useless being. I have won her (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) affections; her (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) happiness depends totally upon me; and can I forsake her (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>)? Mrs Ormond says, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) is convinced Virginia would not survive the day of my marriage with another. I am not disposed to believe that girls often die or destroy themselves for love; nor am I a coxcomb enough to suppose that love for me must be extraordinarily desperate. But here's a girl, who is of a melancholy temperament, who has a great deal of natural sensibility, whose affections have all been concentrated, who has lived in solitude, whose imagination has dwelt, for a length of time, upon a certain set of ideas, who has but one object of hope; in such a mind, and in such circumstances, passion may rise to a paroxysm of despair.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>Pity, generosity, and honour, made him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) resolve not to abandon this unfortunate girl though he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) felt that every time he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) saw Virginia, his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) love for Belinda increased. It was this struggle in his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) mind betwixt love and honour which produced all the apparent inconsistency and irresolution that puzzled Lady Delacour and perplexed Belinda. The lock of beautiful hair, which so unluckily fell at Belinda's feet, was Virginia's; he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) was going to take it to the painter, who had made the hair in her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) picture considerably too dark. How the picture got into the exhibition must now be explained.

<p/>Whilst Mr Hervey's mind was in that painful state of doubt which has just been described, a circumstance happened that promised him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) some relief from his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) embarrassment. Mr Moreton, the clergyman who used to read prayers every Sunday for Mrs Ormond and Virginia, did not come one Sunday at the usual time: the next morning he (<font color='blue'><b>Moreton</b></font>) called on Mr Hervey, with a face that showed he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) had something of importance to communicate.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have hopes, my dear Clarence,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>), `that I have found out your Virginia's father. Yesterday, a musical friend of mine persuaded me to go with him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) to hear the singing at the Asylum for children in St George's Fields. There is a girl there who has indeed a charming voice -- but that's not to the present purpose. After church was over, I happened to be one of the last that stayed; for I am too old to love bustling through a crowd. Perhaps, as you are impatient, you think that's nothing to the purpose; and yet it is, as you shall hear. When the congregation had almost left the church, I observed that the children of the Asylum remained in their places, by order of one of the governors; and a middle-aged gentleman went round amongst the elder girls, examined their countenances with care, and inquired with much anxiety their ages, and every particular relative to their parents. The stranger held a miniature picture in his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) hand, with which he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) compared each face. I was not near enough to him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>),<div class="bookquote">'' continued Mr Moreton, `to see the miniature distinctly: but from the glimpse I caught of it, I thought that it was like your Virginia, though it seemed to be the portrait of a child but four or five years old. I understand that this gentleman will be at the Asylum again next Sunday; I heard him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) express a wish to see some of the girls who happened last Sunday to be absent.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you know this gentleman's name, or where he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) lives?''  (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div>said Clarence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I know nothing of him (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr Moreton</b></font>)</div>replied Mr Moreton, `except that he (<font color='blue'><b>Moreton</b></font>) seems fond of painting; for he (<font color='blue'><b>Moreton</b></font>) told one of the directors, who was looking at his (<font color='blue'><b>Moreton</b></font>) miniature, that it was remarkably well painted, and that, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Moreton</b></font>) happier days, he (<font color='blue'><b>Moreton</b></font>) had been something of a judge of the art.''

<p/>Impatient to see the stranger, who, he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) did not doubt, was Virginia's father, Clarence Hervey went the next Sunday to the Asylum; but no such gentleman appeared, and all that he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) could learn respecting him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was, that he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had applied to one of the directors of the institution for leave to see and question the girls, in hopes of finding amongst them his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) lost daughter; that in the course of the week, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had seen all those who were not at the church the last Sunday. None of the directors knew any thing more concerning him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>); but the porter remarked, that he (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) came in a very handsome coach, and one of the girls of the Asylum said that he (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) gave her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) half a guinea, because she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) was a little like his (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) poor Rachel, who was dead; but that he (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) had added, with a sigh, <div class="bookquote">``This cannot be my daughter, for she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) is only thirteen, and my girl, if she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) be now living, must be nearly eighteen.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The age, the name, every circumstance confirmed Mr Hervey in the belief that this stranger was the father of Virginia, and he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) was disappointed and provoked by having missed the opportunity of seeing or speaking to him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>). It occurred to Clarence that the gentleman might probably visit the Foundling Hospital, and thither he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) immediately went, to make inquiries. He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was told that a person, such as he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) described, had been there about a month before, and had compared the face of the oldest girls with a little picture of a child: that he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) gave money to several of the girls, but that they did not know his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) name, or any thing more about him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>).

<p/>Mr Hervey now inserted proper advertisements in all the papers, but without producing any effect. At last, recollecting what Mr Moreton told him (<font color='blue'><b>Moreton</b></font>) of the stranger's love of pictures, he (<font color='blue'><b>Moreton</b></font>) determined to put his (<font color='blue'><b>Moreton</b></font>) portrait of Virginia into the exhibition, in hopes that the gentleman might go there and ask some questions about it, which might lead to a discovery. The young artist, who had painted this picture, was under particular obligations to Clarence, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) promised that he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) would faithfully comply with his (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) request, to be at Somerset-house every morning, as soon as the exhibition opened; that he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) would stay there till it closed, and watch whether any of the spectators were particularly struck with the portrait of Virginia. If any person should ask questions respecting the picture, he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) was to let Mr Hervey know immediately, and give the inquirer his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) address.

<p/>Now it happened that the very day when Lady Delacour and Belinda were at the exhibition, the painter called Clarence aside, and informed him (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) that a gentleman had just inquired from him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) very eagerly, whether the picture of Virginia was a portrait. This gentleman proved to be not the stranger who had been at the Asylum, but an eminent jeweller, who told Mr Hervey that his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) curiosity about the picture arose merely from its striking likeness to a miniature, which had been lately left at his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) house to be new set. It belonged to a Mr Hartley, a gentleman who had made a considerable fortune in the West Indies, but who was prevented from enjoying his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) affluence by the loss of an only daughter, of whom the miniature was a portrait, taken when she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) was not more than four or five years old. When Clarence heard all this, he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) was extremely impatient to know where Mr Hartley was to be found; but the jeweller could only tell him (<font color='blue'><b>jeweller</b></font>) that the miniature had been called for the preceding day by Mr Hartley's servant, who said his (<font color='blue'><b>Hartley</b></font>) master was leaving town in a great hurry to go to Portsmouth, to join the West India fleet, which was to sail with the first favourable wind.

<p/>Clarence determined immediately to follow him (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) to Portsmouth: he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) had not a moment to spare, for the wind was actually favourable, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) only chance of seeing Mr Hartley was by reaching Portsmouth as soon as possible. This was the cause of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hartley</b></font>) taking leave of Belinda in such an abrupt manner: painful indeed were his (<font color='blue'><b>Hartley</b></font>) feelings at that moment, and great the difficulty he (<font color='blue'><b>Hartley</b></font>) felt in parting with her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>), without giving any explanation of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hartley</b></font>) conduct, which must have appeared to her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) capricious and mysterious. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hartley</b></font>) was aware that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hartley</b></font>) had explicitly avowed to Lady Delacour his (<font color='blue'><b>Hartley</b></font>) admiration of Miss Portman, and that in a thousand instances he (<font color='blue'><b>Hartley</b></font>) had betrayed his (<font color='blue'><b>Hartley</b></font>) passion. Yet of her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) love he (<font color='blue'><b>Hartley</b></font>) dared not trust himself to think, whilst his (<font color='blue'><b>Hartley</b></font>) affairs were in this doubtful state. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hartley</b></font>) had, it is true, some faint hopes that a change in Virginia's situation might produce an alteration in her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) sentiments, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Hartley</b></font>) resolved to decide his (<font color='blue'><b>Hartley</b></font>) own conduct by the manner in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) should behave, if her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) father should be found, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) should become heiress to a considerable fortune. New views might then open to her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) imagination: the world, the fashionable world, in all its glory, would be before her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>); her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) beauty and fortune would attract a variety of admirers, and Clarence thought that perhaps her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) partiality for him (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) might become less exclusive, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) had more opportunities of choice. If her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) love arose merely from circumstances, with circumstances it would change; if it were only a disease of the imagination, induced by her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) seclusion from society, it might be cured by mixing with the world; and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) should be at liberty to follow the dictates of his (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) own heart, and declare his (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) attachment to Belinda. But if he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) should find that change of situation made no alteration in Virginia's sentiments, if her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) happiness should absolutely depend upon the realization of those hopes which he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) had imprudently excited, he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) should be bound to her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) by all the laws of justice and honour; laws which no passion could tempt him (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) to break. Full of these ideas, he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) hurried to Portsmouth in pursuit of Virginia's father. The first question he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) asked, upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) arrival there, may easily be guessed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Has the West India fleet sailed?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No: it sails to-morrow morning,''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>was the answer.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) hastened instantly to make inquiries for Mr Hartley. No such person could be found, no such gentleman was to be heard of any where. Hartley, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hartley</b></font>) was sure, was the name which the jeweller mentioned to him (<font color='blue'><b>Hartley</b></font>), but it was in vain that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hartley</b></font>) repeated it; no Mr Hartley was to be heard of at Portsmouth, except a pawnbroker. At last, a steward of one of the West Indiamen recollected that a gentleman of that name came over with him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) in the Effingham, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) talked of returning in the same vessel to the West Indies, if he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) should ever leave England again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But we have heard nothing of him (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) since, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>the steward</b></font>)</div>said the steward. <div class="bookquote">``No passage is taken for him (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) with us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And my life to a china orange,''  (<font color='red'><b>a sailor</b></font>)</div>cried a sailor who was standing by, `he (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>)'s gone to kingdom come, or more likely to Bedlam, afore this; for he (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>) was plaguy crazy in his (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>) timbers, and his (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>) head wanted righting, I take it, if it was he (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>), Jack, who used to walk the deck, you know, with a bit of a picture in his (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>) hand, to which he (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>) seemed to be mumbling his (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>) prayers from morning to night. There's no use in sounding for him (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>), master; he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>)'s down in Davy's locker long ago, or stowed into the tight waistcoat before this time o<div class="bookquote">``day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Davy</b></font>)</div><p/>Notwithstanding this knowing sailor's opinion, Clarence would not desist from his (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) sounding; because having so lately heard of him (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) at different places, he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) could not believe that he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) was gone either into Davy's locker or to Bedlam. He (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) imagined that, by some accident, Mr Hartley had been detained upon the road to Portsmouth; and in the expectation that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hartley</b></font>) would certainly arrive before the fleet should sail, Clarence waited with tolerable patience. He (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) waited, however, in vain; he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) saw the Effingham and the whole fleet sail -- no Mr Hartley arrived. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Hartley</b></font>) hailed one of the boats of the Effingham, which was rowing out with some passengers, who had been too late to get on board, his (<font color='blue'><b>Hartley</b></font>) friend the sailor answered, <div class="bookquote">``We've no crazy man here: I told you, master, he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>)'d never go out no more in the Effingham. He (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>)'s where I said, master, you'll find, or nowhere.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the sailor</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr Hervey remained some days at Portsmouth, after the fleet had sailed, in hopes that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) might yet obtain some information; but none could be had; neither could any farther tidings be obtained from the jeweller, who had first mentioned Mr Hartley. Despairing of success in the object of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hartley</b></font>) journey, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hartley</b></font>), however, determined to delay his (<font color='blue'><b>Hartley</b></font>) return to town for some time, in hopes that absence might efface the impression which had been made on the heart of Virginia. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hartley</b></font>) made a tour along the picturesque coasts of Dorset and Devonshire, and it was during this excursion that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hartley</b></font>) wrote the letters to Lady Delacour which have so often been mentioned. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hartley</b></font>) endeavoured to dissipate his (<font color='blue'><b>Hartley</b></font>) thoughts by new scenes and employments, but all his (<font color='blue'><b>Hartley</b></font>) ideas involuntarily centred in Belinda. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Hartley</b></font>) saw new characters, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hartley</b></font>) compared them with hers, or considered how far she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) would approve or condemn them. The books that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hartley</b></font>) read were perused with a constant reference to what she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) would think or feel; and during his (<font color='blue'><b>Hartley</b></font>) whole journey he (<font color='blue'><b>Hartley</b></font>) never beheld any beautiful prospect, without wishing that it could at the same instant be seen by Belinda. If her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) name were mentioned but once in his (<font color='blue'><b>Hartley</b></font>) letters, it was because he (<font color='blue'><b>Hartley</b></font>) dared not trust himself to speak of her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) was for ever present to his (<font color='blue'><b>Hartley</b></font>) mind: but while he (<font color='blue'><b>Hartley</b></font>) was writing to Lady Delacour, her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) idea pressed more strongly upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Hartley</b></font>) heart; he (<font color='blue'><b>Hartley</b></font>) recollected that it was she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) who first gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Hartley</b></font>) a just insight into her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) ladyship's real character; he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) recollected that she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) had joined with him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) in the benevolent design of reconciling her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) to Lord Delacour, and of creating in her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) mind a taste for domestic happiness. This remembrance operated powerfully to excite him (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) to fresh exertions, and the eloquence which touched Lady Delacour so much in these `edifying ' letters, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) called them, was in fact inspired by Belinda.

<p/>Whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) thought distinctly upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) future plans, Virginia's attachment, and the hopes which he (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) had imprudently inspired, appeared insuperable obstacles to his (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) union with Miss Portman; but, in more sanguine moments, he (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) flattered himself with a confused notion that these difficulties would vanish. Great were his (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) surprise and alarm when he (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) received that letter of Lady Delacour's, in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) announced the probability of Belinda's marriage with Mr Vincent. In consequence of his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) moving from place to place in the course of his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) tour, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) did not receive this letter till nearly a fortnight after it should have come to his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) hands. The instant he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) received it he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) set out on his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) way home; he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) travelled with all that expedition which money can command in England: his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) first thought and first wish when he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) arrived in town were to go to Lady Delacour's; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) checked his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) impatience, and proceeded immediately to Twickenham, to have his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) fate decided by Virginia. It was with the most painful sensations that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) again. The accounts which he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) received from Mrs Ormond convinced him (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) that absence had produced none of the effects which he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) expected on the mind of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) pupil. Mrs Ormond was naturally both of an affectionate disposition and a timid temper; she (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) had become excessively fond of Virginia, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) anxiety was more than in proportion to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) love: it sometimes balanced and even overbalanced her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) regard and respect for Clarence Hervey himself. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) spoke of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) attachment to Belinda, and of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) doubts respecting Virginia, she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) could no longer restrain her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) emotion.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, indeed, Mr Hervey,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>), `this is no time for reasoning and doubting. No man in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) senses, no man who is not wilfully blind, could doubt her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) being distractedly fond of you.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sorry for it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div>said Clarence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And why -- oh, why, Mr Hervey? Don't you recollect the time when you were all impatience to call her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) yours, -- when you thought her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) the most charming creature in the whole world?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I had not seen Belinda Portman then.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And I wish to Heaven you never had seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>)! But oh, surely, Mr Hervey, you will not desert my Virginia! -- Must her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) health, her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) happiness, her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) reputation, all be the sacrifice?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Reputation! Mrs Ormond.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Reputation, Mr Hervey: you do not know in what a light she (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) is considered here; nor did I till lately. But I tell you her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) reputation is injured -- fatally injured. It is whispered, and more than whispered everywhere, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) is your mistress. A woman came here the other day with the bullfinch, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) looked at me, and spoke in such an extraordinary way, that I was shocked more than I can express. I need not tell you all the particulars; it is enough that I have made inquiries, and am sure, too sure, of what I say, that nothing but your marriage with Virginia can save her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) reputation; or -- '

<p/>Mrs Ormond stopped short, for at this instant Virgina entered the room, walking in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) slow manner, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) were in a deep reverie.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Since my return,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div>said Clarence, in an embarrassed voice, <div class="bookquote">``I have scarcely heard a syllable from Miss St Pierre's lips.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss St Pierre! -- He (<font color='blue'><b>Pierre</b></font>) used to call me Virginia,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>), turning to Mrs Ormond: `he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) is angry with me -- he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) used to call me Virginia.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But you were a child then, you know, my love,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Ormond/Ormond</b></font>)</div>said Mrs Ormond.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And I wish I was still a child,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Virginia. Then, after a long pause, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) approached Mr Hervey with extreme timidity, and, opening a portfolio which lay on the table, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``If you are at leisure -- if I do not interrupt you -- would you look at these drawings; though they are not worth your seeing, except as proofs that I can conquer my natural indolence?''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>The drawings were views which she (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) had painted from memory, of scenes in the New Forest, near her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) grandmother's cottage. That cottage was drawn with an exactness that proved how fresh it was in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) remembrance. Many recollections rushed forcibly into Clarence Hervey's mind at the sight of this cottage. The charming image of Virginia, as it first struck his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) fancy, -- the smile, the innocent smile, with which she (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) offered him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) the finest rose in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) basket, -- the stern voice in which her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) grandmother spoke to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>), -- the prophetic fears of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) protectress, -- the figure of the dying woman, -- the solemn promise he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) made to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>), -- all recurred, in rapid succession, to his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) memory.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't seem to like that,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Virginia; and then putting another drawing into his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) hands, `perhaps this may please you better.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They are beautiful; they are surprisingly well done!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>exclaimed he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Pierre</b></font>) would like them! I told you so!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Ormond/Ormond</b></font>)</div>cried Mrs Ormond, in a triumphant tone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You see,''  (<font color='red'><b>Pierre/Virginia St Pierre/St Pierre</b></font>)</div>said Virginia, `that though you have heard scarcely a syllable from Miss St Pierre's lips since your return, yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) has not been unmindful of your wishes in your absence. You told her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>), some time ago, that you wished she (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) would try to improve in drawing. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) has done her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) best. But do not trouble yourself to look at them any longer,'' said Virginia, taking one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) drawings from his (<font color='blue'><b>Pierre</b></font>) hand; ``I merely wanted to show you that, though I have no genius, I have some -- '

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) voice faltered so that she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) could not pronounce the word gratitude.

<p/>Mrs Ormond pronounced it for her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>); and added, <div class="bookquote">``I can answer for it, that Virginia is not ungrateful.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Ormond/Ormond</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ungrateful!''  (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div>repeated Clarence; `who ever thought her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) so? Why did you put these ideas into her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) mind?''

<p/>Virginia, resting her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) head on Mrs Ormond's shoulder, wept bitterly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You have worked upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) sensibility till you have made her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) miserable,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div>cried Clarence, angrily. <div class="bookquote">``Virginia, listen to me: look at me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>), affectionately taking her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) hand; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) pressed closer to Mrs Ormond, and would not raise her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``Do not consider me as your master -- your tyrant; do not imagine that I think you ungrateful!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div><p/>Clarence uttered a deep sigh.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But if you feel too much, my dearest Virginia, -- if you give way to your feelings in this manner,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Ormond/Ormond</b></font>)</div>said Mrs Ormond, `you will make both yourself and Mr Hervey unhappy.''

<p/>``Heaven forbid! The first wish of my soul is -- ' She (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) paused. <div class="bookquote">``I should be the most ungrateful wretch in the world, if I were to make him (<font color='blue'><b>tyrant</b></font>) unhappy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But if he (<font color='blue'><b>tyrant</b></font>) sees you miserable, Virginia?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then he (<font color='blue'><b>tyrant</b></font>) shall not see it,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>), wiping the tears from her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``To imagine that you were unhappy, and that you concealed it from us, would be still worse,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div>said Clarence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But why should you imagine it?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>replied Virginia; `you are too good, too kind; but do not fancy that I am not happy: I am sure I ought to be happy.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you regret your cottage?''  (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div>said Clarence: `these drawings show how well you remember it.''

<p/>Virginia coloured; and, with some hesitation, answered, <div class="bookquote">``Is it my fault if I cannot forget?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You were happier then, Virginia, than you are now, you will confess,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Ormond/Ormond</b></font>)</div>said Mrs Ormond, who was not a woman of refined delicacy, and who thought that the best chance she (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) had of working upon Mr Hervey's sense of honour was by making it plain to him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) how much her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) pupil's affections were engaged.

<p/>Virginia made no answer to this question, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) silence touched Clarence more than any thing she (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) could have said. When Mrs Ormond repeated her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) question, he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) relieved the trembling girl by saying, <div class="bookquote">``My dear Mrs Ormond, confidence must be won, not demanded.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have no right to insist upon confessions, I know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Ormond/Ormond</b></font>)</div>said Mrs Ormond; `but -- '

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Confessions!

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why will you agitate her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>), Mrs Ormond, in this manner?''  (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div>said Mr Hervey, with an expression of sudden anger. It was succeeded by a look of such tender compassion for Virginia, that Mrs Ormond rejoiced to have excited his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) anger; at any price she (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) wished to serve her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) beloved pupil.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do not be in the least apprehensive, my dear Virginia, that we should take ungenerous advantage of the openness and simplicity of your character,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div>said Mr Hervey.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, no, no; I cannot, do not apprehend any thing ungenerous from you; you are, you ever have been, my best, my most generous friend! But I fear that I have not the simplicity of character, the openness that you imagine; and yet, I am sure, I wish, from the bottom of my heart -- I wish to do right, if I knew how. But there is not one -- no, not one -- person in the whole world,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>continued she (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>), her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) eyes moving from Mrs Ormond to Mr Hervey, and from him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) to Mrs Ormond again, `not one person in the whole world I dare -- I ought -- to lay my heart open to. I have, perhaps, said more than is proper already. But this I know,<div class="bookquote">'' added she (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>), in a firm tone, rising, and addressing herself to Clarence, `you shall never be made unhappy by me. And do not think about my happiness so much,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>), forcing a smile; <div class="bookquote">``I am, I will be, perfectly happy. Only let me always know your wishes, your sentiments, your feelings, and by them I will, as I ought, regulate mine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Amiable, charming, generous girl!''  (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div>cried Clarence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Take care,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Ormond/Ormond</b></font>)</div>said Mrs Ormond; `take care, Virginia, lest you promise more than you can perform. Wishes, and feelings, and sentiments, are not to be so easily regulated.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I did not, I believe, say it was easy; but I hope it is possible,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>replied Virginia. <div class="bookquote">``I promise nothing but what I am able to perform.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I doubt it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Ormond/Ormond</b></font>)</div>said Mrs Ormond, shaking her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) head. ``You are -- you will be perfectly happy. Oh, Virginia, my love, do not deceive yourself'; do not deceive us so terribly. I am sorry to put you to the blush; but -- '

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not a word more, my dear madam, I beg -- I insist,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div>said Mr Hervey in a commanding tone; but, for the first time in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) life, regardless of him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) persisted.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I only ask you to call to mind, my dearest Virginia,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>), taking her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) hand, `the morning that you screamed in your sleep, the morning when you told me the frightful dream -- were you perfectly happy then?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is easy to force my thoughts from me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Ormond/Ormond</b></font>)</div>said Virginia, withdrawing her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) hand from Mrs Ormond; `but it is cruel to do so.'' And with an air of offended dignity she (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) passed them, and quitted the room.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish to Heaven!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Ormond/Ormond</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Mrs Ormond, `that Miss Portman was married, and out of the way -- I shall never forgive myself! We have used this poor girl cruelly amongst us: she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) loves you to distraction, and I have encouraged her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) passion, and I have betrayed her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) -- oh, fool that I was! I told her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) would certainly be your wife.''

<p/>``You have told her (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>) so! -- Did I not charge you, Mrs Ormond -- '

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; but I could not help it, when I saw the sweet girl fading away -- and, besides, I am sure she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) thought it, from your manner, long and long before I told it to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). Do you forget how fond of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) you were scarce one short year ago? And do you forget how plainly you let her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) see your passion? Oh, how can you blame her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), if she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) loves you, and if she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) is unhappy?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I blame no one but myself,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div>cried Clarence; <div class="bookquote">``I must abide by the consequences of my own folly. Unhappy! -- she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) shall not be unhappy; she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) does not deserve to be so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) walked backward and forward, with hasty steps, for some minutes; then sat down and wrote a letter to Virginia.

<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) had finished it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) put it into Mrs Ormond's hands.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Read it -- seal it -- give it to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) -- and let her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) answer be sent to town to me, at Dr X's, in Clifford-street.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Ormond/Ormond</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs Ormond clasped her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) hands, in an ecstasy of joy, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) glanced her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) eye over the letter, for it contained an offer of his (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This is like yourself; like what I always knew you to be, dear Mr Hervey!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) exclaimed.

<p/>But her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) exclamation was lost upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>). When she (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) looked up, to repeat her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) praises, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) perceived he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) was gone. After the effort which he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) had made, he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) wished for time to tranquillize his (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) mind, before he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) should again see Virginia. What her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) answer to this letter would be he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) could not doubt: his (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) fate was now decided, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) determined immediately to write to Lady Delacour to explain his (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) situation; he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) had not sufficient fortitude at this moment to make such an explanation in person. With all the strength of his (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) mind, he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) endeavoured to exclude Belinda from his (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) thoughts, but curiosity -- -LRB-for he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) would suffer himself to call it by no other name-RRB- -- curiosity to know whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) were actually engaged to Mr Vincent obtruded itself with such force, that it could not be resisted.

<p/>From Dr X-- he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) could obtain full information, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) hastened immediately to town. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) got to Clifford-street, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) found that the doctor was not at home; his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) servant said, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) might probably be met with at Mrs Margaret Delacour's, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) usually finished his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) morning rounds at her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) house. Thither Mr Hervey immediately went.

<p/>The first sound that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) heard, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) went up her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) stairs, was the screaming of a macaw; and the first person he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) saw, through the open door of the drawing-room, was Helena Delacour. She (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) was standing with her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) back to him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>), leaning over the macaw's cage, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) say in a joyful tone, <div class="bookquote">``Yes, though you do scream so frightfully, my pretty macaw, I love you as well as Marriott ever did. When my dear, good Miss Portman, sent this macaw -- My dear aunt! here's Mr Hervey! -- you were just wishing to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr Hervey,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>said the old lady, with a benevolent smile, `your little friend Helena tells you truth; we were just wishing for you. I am sure it will give you pleasure to hear that I am at last a convert to your opinion of Lady Delacour. She (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) has given up all those that I used to call her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) rantipole acquaintance. She (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) has reconciled herself to her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) husband, and to his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) friends; and Helena is to go home to live with her (<font color='blue'><b>Helena</b></font>). Here is a charming note I have just received from her (<font color='blue'><b>Helena</b></font>)! Dine with me on Thursday next, and you will meet her (<font color='blue'><b>Helena</b></font>) ladyship, and see a happy family party. You have had some share in the reformation, I know, and that was the reason I wished that you should be with us on Thursday. You see I am not an obstinate old woman, though I was cross the first day I saw you at Lady Anne Percival's. I found I was mistaken in your character, and I am glad of it. But this note of Lady Delacour's seems to have struck you dumb.''

<p/>There were, indeed, a few words in this note, which deprived him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>), for some moments, of all power of utterance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The report you have heard -LRB-unlike most other reports-RRB- is perfectly well founded: Mr Vincent, Belinda's admirer, is here. I will bring him (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) with us on Thursday.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr Hervey was relieved from the necessity of accounting to Mrs Delacour for his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) sudden embarrassment, by the entrance of Dr X-- and another gentleman, of whom, in the confusion of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) mind, Clarence did not at first take any notice. Dr X--, with his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) usual mixture of benevolence and raillery, addressed himself to Clarence, whilst the stranger took out of his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) pocket some papers, and in a low voice entered earnestly into conversation with Mrs Delacour.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, tell me, if you can, Clarence,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dr</b></font>)</div>said Dr X--, `which of your three mistresses you like best? I think I left you some months ago in great doubt upon this subject: are you still in that philosophic state?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div>said Clarence; `all doubts are over -- I am going to be married.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Bravo! -- But you look as if you were going to be hanged. May I, as it will so soon be in the newspaper, may I ask the name of the fair lady?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Virginia St Pierre. You shall know her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) history and mine when we are alone,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div>said Mr Hervey, lowering his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) voice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You need not lower your voice,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dr</b></font>)</div>said Dr X--, `for Mrs Delacour is, as you see, so much taken up with her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) own affairs, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) has no curiosity for those of her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) neighbours; and Mr Hartley is as busy as -- '

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr who? Mr Hartley did you say?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr Hartley/Hartley</b></font>)</div>interrupted Clarence, eagerly turning his (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) eyes upon the stranger, who was a middle-aged gentleman, exactly answering the description of the person who had been at the Asylum in search of his (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) daughter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr Hartley! yes. What astonishes you so much?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said X--, calmly. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Hartley</b></font>) is a West Indian. I met him (<font color='blue'><b>Hartley</b></font>) in Cambridgeshire last summer, at his (<font color='blue'><b>Hartley</b></font>) friend Mr Horton's; he (<font color='blue'><b>Hartley</b></font>) has been very generous to the poor people who suffered by the fire, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Hartley</b></font>) is now consulting with Mrs Delacour, who has an estate adjoining to Mr Horton's, about her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) tenants, whose houses in the village were burnt. Now I have, in as few words and parentheses as possible, told you all I know of Mr Hartley's history; but your curiosity still looks voracious.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I want to know whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Hartley</b></font>) has a miniature?''  (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div>said Clarence, hastily. <div class="bookquote">``Introduce me to him (<font color='blue'><b>Hartley</b></font>), for Heaven's sake, directly!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr Hartley,''  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>cried the doctor, raising his (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) voice, `give me leave to introduce my friend Mr Hervey to you, and to your miniature picture, if you have one.''

<p/>Mr Hartley sighed profoundly as he (<font color='blue'><b>Hartley</b></font>) drew from his (<font color='blue'><b>Hartley</b></font>) bosom a small portrait, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Hartley</b></font>) put into Mr Hervey's hands, saying, <div class="bookquote">``Alas! sir, you cannot, I fear, give me any tidings of the original; it is the picture of a daughter, whom I have never seen since she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) was an infant -- whom I never shall see again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div><p/>Clarence instantly knew it to be Virginia; but as he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) was upon the point of making some joyful exclamation, he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) felt Dr X-- touch his (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) shoulder, and looking up at Mr Hartley, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hartley</b></font>) saw in his (<font color='blue'><b>Hartley</b></font>) countenance such strong workings of passion, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hartley</b></font>) prudently suppressed his (<font color='blue'><b>Hartley</b></font>) own emotion, and calmly said, <div class="bookquote">``It would be cruel, sir, to give you false hopes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It would kill me -- it would kill me, sir! -- or worse! -- worse! a thousand times worse!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr Hartley/Hartley</b></font>)</div>cried Mr Hartley, putting his (<font color='blue'><b>Hartley</b></font>) hand to his (<font color='blue'><b>Hartley</b></font>) forehead. <div class="bookquote">``What,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>continued he (<font color='blue'><b>Hartley</b></font>) impatiently, `what was the meaning of the look you gave, when you first saw that picture? Speak, if you have any humanity! Did you ever see any one that resembles that picture?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have seen, I think, a picture,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div>said Clarence Hervey, `that has some resemblance to it.''

<p/>``When? where? -- '

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My good sire,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dr</b></font>)</div>said Dr X--, `let me recommend it to you to consider that there is scarcely any possibility of judging, from the features of children, of what their faces may be when they grow up. Nothing can be more fallacious than these accidental resemblances between the pictures of children and of grown-up people.''

<p/>Mr Hartley's countenance fell.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div>added Clarence Hervey, `you will perhaps, sir, think it worth your while to see the picture of which I speak; you can see it at Mr F--'s, the painter, in Newman-street; and I will accompany you thither whenever you please.''

<p/>``This moment, if you would have the goodness: my carriage is at the door; and Mrs Delacour will be so kind to excuse -- '

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, make no apologies to me at such a time as this,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Delacour/Mrs Margaret Delacour/Margaret</b></font>)</div>said Mrs Delacour. <div class="bookquote">``Away with you, gentlemen, as soon as you please; upon condition, that if you have any good news to tell, some of you will remember, in the midst of your joy, that such an old woman as Mrs Margaret Delacour exists, who loves to hear good news of those who deserve it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>It was so late in the day when they got to Newman-street, that they were obliged to light candles. Trembling with eagerness, Mr Hartley drew near, while Clarence held the light to the picture.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is so like,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>), looking at his (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) miniature, `that I dare not believe my senses. Dr X--, pray do you look. My head is so dizzy, and my eyes so -- What do you think, sir? What do you say, doctor?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That the likeness is certainly striking -- but this seems to be a fancy piece.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A fancy piece,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr Hartley/Hartley</b></font>)</div>repeated Mr Hartley, with terror: `why then did you bring me here? -- A fancy piece!''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, sir; it is a portrait,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div>said Clarence; `and if you will be calm, I will tell you more.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I will be calm -- only is she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) alive?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The lady, of whom this is the portrait, is alive,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div>replied Clarence Hervey, who was obliged to exert his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) utmost command over himself, to maintain that composure which he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) saw was necessary; `the lady, of whom this is the portrait, is alive, and you shall see her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) to-morrow.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, why not now? Cannot I see her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) now? I must see her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) to-night -- this instant, sir!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is impossible,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div>said Mr Hervey, `that you should see her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) this instant, for she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) is some miles off at Twickenham.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is too late to go thither now; you cannot think of it, Mr Hartley,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dr</b></font>)</div>continued Dr X--, in a tone of command, to which he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) yielded more readily than to reason.

<p/>Clarence had the presence of mind to recollect that it would be necessary to prepare poor Virgina for this meeting, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) sent a messenger immediately to request that Mrs Ormond would communicate the intelligence with all the caution in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) power.

<p/>The next morning, Mr Hartley and Mr Hervey set off together for Twickenham. In their way thither Clarence gradually confirmed Mr Hartley in the belief that Virginia was his (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) daughter, by relating all the circumstances that he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) had learned from her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) grandmother, and from Mrs Smith, the farmer's wife, with whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) had formerly been acquainted: the name, the age, every particular, as it was disclosed, heightened his (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) security, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) joy.

<p/>For some time Mr Hartley's mind was so intent that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hartley</b></font>) could not listen to any thing, but at last Clarence engaged his (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) attention and suspended his (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) anxiety, by giving him (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) a history of his (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) own connexion with Virginia, from the day of his (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) first discovering her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) in the New Forest, to the letter which he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) had just written, to offer her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) hand. The partiality which it was suspected Virginia felt for him (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) was the only circumstance which he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) suppressed, because, notwithstanding all Mrs Ormond had said, and all he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) had himself heard and seen, his (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) obstinate incredulity required confirmation under her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) own hand, or positively from her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) own lips. He (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) still fancied it was possible that change of situation might alter her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) views and sentiments; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) earnestly entreated that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) might be left entirely to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) own decision. It was necessary to make this stipulation with her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) father; for in the excess of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) gratitude for the kindness which Clarence had shown to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) protested that he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) should look upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) as a monster if she (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) did not love him (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>): he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) added, that if Mr Hervey had not a farthing, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) should prefer him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) to every man upon earth; he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>), however, promised that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) would conceal his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) wishes, and that his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) daughter should act entirely from the dictates of her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) own mind. In the fulness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) heart, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) told Clarence all those circumstances of his (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) conduct towards Virginia's mother which had filled his (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) soul with remorse. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was scarcely sixteen when he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) ran away with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) from a boarding-school; he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) was at that time a gay officer, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) a sentimental girl, who had been spoiled by early novel-reading. Her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) father had a small place at court, lived beyond his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) fortune, educated his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) daughter, to whom he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) could give no portion, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) were to be heiress to a large estate; then died, and left his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) widow absolutely in penury. This widow was the old lady who lived in the cottage in the New Forest. It was just at the time of her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) husband's death, and of her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) own distress, that she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) heard of the elopement of her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) daughter from school. Mr Hartley's parents were so much incensed by the match, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hartley</b></font>) was prevailed upon to separate from his (<font color='blue'><b>Hartley</b></font>) wife, and to go abroad, to push his (<font color='blue'><b>Hartley</b></font>) fortune in the army. His (<font color='blue'><b>Hartley</b></font>) marriage had been secret: his (<font color='blue'><b>Hartley</b></font>) own friends disavowed it, notwithstanding the repeated, urgent entreaties of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hartley</b></font>) wife and of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) mother, who was her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) only surviving relation. His (<font color='blue'><b>Hartley</b></font>) wife, on her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) death-bed, wrote to urge him (<font color='blue'><b>Hartley</b></font>) to take charge of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hartley</b></font>) daughter, and, to make the appeal stronger to his (<font color='blue'><b>Hartley</b></font>) feelings, she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) sent him (<font color='blue'><b>Hartley</b></font>) a picture of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hartley</b></font>) little girl, who was then about four years old. Mr Hartley, however, was intent upon forming a new connexion with the rich widow of a planter in Jamaica. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hartley</b></font>) married the widow, took possession of her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) fortune, and all his (<font color='blue'><b>Hartley</b></font>) affections soon were fixed upon a son, for whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Hartley</b></font>) formed, even from the moment of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hartley</b></font>) birth, various schemes of aggrandizement. The boy lived till he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was about ten years old, when he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) caught a fever, which at that time raged in Jamaica, and, after a few days' illness, died. His (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) mother was carried off by the same disease; and Mr Hartley, left alone in the midst of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hartley</b></font>) wealth felt how insufficient it was to happiness. Remorse now seized him (<font color='blue'><b>Hartley</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Hartley</b></font>) returned to England in search of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hartley</b></font>) deserted daughter. To this neglected child he (<font color='blue'><b>Hartley</b></font>) now looked forward for the peace and happiness of the remainder of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hartley</b></font>) life. Disappointment in all his (<font color='blue'><b>Hartley</b></font>) inquiries for some months preyed upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Hartley</b></font>) spirits to such a degree, that his (<font color='blue'><b>Hartley</b></font>) intellects were at times disordered; this derangement was the cause of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hartley</b></font>) not sooner recovering his (<font color='blue'><b>Hartley</b></font>) child. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hartley</b></font>) was in confinement during the time that Clarence Hervey's advertisements were inserted in the papers; and his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) illness was also the cause of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) not going to Portsmouth, and sailing in the Effingham, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) had originally intended. The history of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) connexion with Mr Horton would be uninteresting to the reader, it is enough to say, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) was prevailed upon, by that gentleman, to spend some time in the country with him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>), for the recovery of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) health; and it was there that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) became acquainted with Dr X--, who introduced him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>), as we have seen, to Mrs Margaret Delacour, at whose house he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) met Clarence Hervey. This is the most succinct account that we can give of him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) affairs. His (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) own account was ten times as long; but we spare our readers his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) incoherences and reflections, because, perhaps, they are in a hurry to get to Twickenham, and to hear of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) meeting with Virginia.

<p/>Mrs Ormond found it no easy task to prepare Virginia for the sight of Mr Hartley. Virginia had scarcely ever spoken of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) father; but the remembrance of things which she (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) had heard of him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) from her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) grandmother was fresh in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) mind; she (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) had often pictured him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) fancy, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) had secretly nourished the hope that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) should not for ever be a deserted child. Mrs Ormond had observed, that in those romances, of which she (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) was so fond, every thing that related to children who were deserted by their parents affected her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) strongly.

<p/>The belief in what the French call la force du sang was suited to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) affectionate temper and ardent imagination, and it had taken full possession of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) mind. The eloquence of romance persuaded her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) should not only discover but love her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) father with intuitive filial piety, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) longed to experience those yearnings of affection of which she (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) had read so much.

<p/>The first moment that Mrs Ormond began to speak of Mr Clarence Hervey's hopes of discovering her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) father, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) was transported with joy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My father! -- How delightful that word father sounds! -- My father? -- May I say my father? -- And will he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) own me, and will he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) love me, and will he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) give me his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) blessing, and will he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) fold me in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) arms, and call me his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) daughter, his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) dear daughter? -- Oh, how I shall love him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)! I will make it the whole business of my life to please him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The whole business?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Ormond/Ormond</b></font>)</div>said Mrs Ormond, smiling.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not the whole,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Virginia; <div class="bookquote">``I hope my father will like Mr Hervey. Did not you say that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) is rich? I wish that my father may be very rich.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is the last wish that I should have expected to hear from you, my Virginia.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But do you not know why I wish it? -- that I may show my gratitude to Mr Hervey.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear child,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Ormond/Ormond</b></font>)</div>said Mrs Ormond, `these are most generous sentiments, and worthy of you; but do not let your imagination run away with you at this rate -- Mr Hervey is rich enough.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) were poor,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said Virginia, `that I might make him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) rich.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) would not love you the better, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Ormond/Ormond</b></font>)</div>said Mrs Ormond, `if you had the wealth of the Indies. Perhaps your father may not be rich; therefore do not set your heart upon this idea.''

<p/>Virginia sighed: fear succeeded to hope, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) imagination immediately reversed the bright picture that it had drawn.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But I am afraid,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>), `that this gentleman is not my father -- how disappointed I shall be! I wish you had never told me all this, my dear Mrs Ormond.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I would not have told it to you, if Mr Hervey had not desired that I should; and you may be sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) would not have desired it, unless he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) had good reason to believe that you would not be disappointed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) is not sure -- he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) does not say he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) is quite sure. And, even if I were quite certain of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) being my father, how can I be certain that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) will not disown me -- he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), who has deserted me so long? My grandmother, I remember, often used to say that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had no natural affection.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Your grandmother was mistaken, then; for he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) has been searching for his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) child all over England, Mr Hervey says and he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) has almost lost his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) senses with grief and with remorse!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Remorse!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, remorse, for having so long deserted you: he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) fears that you will hate him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hate him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>)! -- is it possible to hate a father?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Virginia.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) dreads that you should never forgive him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Forgive him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)! -- I have read of parents forgiving their children, but I never remember to have read of a daughter forgiving her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) father. Forgive! you should not have used that word. I cannot forgive my father: but I can love him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), and I will make him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) quite forget all his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) sorrows -- I mean, all his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) sorrows about me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>person</b></font>)</div><p/>After this conversation Virginia spent her (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>) time in imagining what sort of person her (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>) father would be; whether he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was like Mr Hervey; what words he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) would say; where he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) would sit; whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) would sit beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>); and, above all, whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) would give her (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) blessing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am afraid,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>), `of liking my father better than any body else.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No danger of that, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Ormand</b></font>)</div>said Mrs Ormand, smiling. <div class="bookquote">``I am glad of it, for it would be very wrong and ungrateful to like any thing in this world so well as Mr Hervey.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The carriage now came to the door: Mrs Ormand instantly ran to the window, but Virginia had not power to move -- her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormand</b></font>) heart beat violently.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) come?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Ormand</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) is getting out of the carriage this moment!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Virginia stood with her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormand</b></font>) eyes eagerly fixed upon the door. <div class="bookquote">``Hark!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Ormand</b></font>), laying her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormand</b></font>) hand upon Mrs Ormond's arm, to prevent her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormand</b></font>) from moving; <div class="bookquote">``Hush! that we may hear his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) voice.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Ormond/Ormond</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ormand</b></font>) was breathless -- no voice was to be heard: <div class="bookquote">``They are not coming,''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Ormand</b></font>), turning as pale as death. An instant afterwards her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormand</b></font>) colour returned -- she (<font color='blue'><b>Ormand</b></font>) heard the steps of two people coming up the stairs.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``His (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) step! -- Do you hear it? -- Is it my father?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Virginia's imagination was worked to the highest pitch; she (<font color='blue'><b>Ormand</b></font>) could scarcely sustain herself: Mrs Ormond supported her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>). At this instant her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) father appeared.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My child! -- the image of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) mother!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>exclaimed he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), stopping short: he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) sunk upon a chair.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My father!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>cried Virginia, springing forward, and throwing herself at his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) feet.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The voice of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) mother!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr Hartley/Hartley</b></font>)</div>said Mr Hartley. <div class="bookquote">``My daughter! -- My long lost child!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Hartley</b></font>) tried to raise her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>), but could not, her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) arms were clasped round his (<font color='blue'><b>Hartley</b></font>) knee, her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) face rested upon it, and when be stooped to kiss her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) cheek, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hartley</b></font>) found it cold -- she (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) had fainted.

<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) came to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) senses, and found herself in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) father's arms, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) could scarcely believe that it was not a dream.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your blessing! -- give me your blessing, and then I shall know that you are indeed my father!''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>cried Virginia, kneeling to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), and looking up with an enthusiastic expression of filial piety in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) countenance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``God bless you, my sweet child!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), laying his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) hand upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>); `and God forgive your father!''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My grandmother died without giving me her (<font color='blue'><b>grandmother</b></font>) blessing,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said Virginia; `but now I have been blessed by my father! Happy, happy moment! -- O that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) could look down from heaven, and see us at this instant!''

<p/>Virginia was so much astonished and overpowered by this sudden discovery of a parent, and by the novelty of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) first caresses, that after the first violent effervescence of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) sensibility was over, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) might, to an indifferent spectator, have appeared stupid and insensible. Mrs Ormond, though far from an indifferent spectator, was by no means a penetrating judge of the human heart: she (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) seldom saw more than the external symptoms of feeling, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) was apt to be rather impatient with her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) friends if theirs did not accord with her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) own.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Virginia, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>), in rather a reproachful tone, <div class="bookquote">``Mr Hervey, you see, has left the room, on purpose to leave you at full liberty to talk to your father; and I am going -- but you are so silent!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have so much to say, and my heart is so full!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Virginia.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I know you told me of a thousand things that you had to say to your father, before you saw him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But now I see him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), I have forgotten them all. I can think of nothing but of him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) and Mr Hervey,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Ormond/Ormond</b></font>)</div>said Mrs Ormond.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I was not thinking of Mr Hervey at that moment,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Virginia, blushing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, my love, I will leave you to think and talk of what you please,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Ormond/Ormond</b></font>)</div>said Mrs Ormond, smiling significantly as she (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) left the room.

<p/>Mr Hartley folded his (<font color='blue'><b>Hartley</b></font>) daughter in his (<font color='blue'><b>Hartley</b></font>) arms with the fondest expressions of parental affection, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Hartley</b></font>) was upon the point of telling her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) how much he (<font color='blue'><b>Hartley</b></font>) approved of the choice of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) heart, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Hartley</b></font>) recollected his (<font color='blue'><b>Hartley</b></font>) promise, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Hartley</b></font>) determined to sound her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) inclinations farther, before he (<font color='blue'><b>Hartley</b></font>) even mentioned the name of Clarence Hervey.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) began by painting the pleasures of the world, that world from which she (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) had hitherto been secluded.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) with simple indifference: not even her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) curiosity was excited.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) observed, that though she (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) had no curiosity to see, it was natural that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) must have some pleasure in the thoughts of being seen.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What pleasure?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Virginia.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The pleasure of being admired and loved: beauty and grace such as yours, my child, cannot be seen without commanding admiration and love.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not want to be admired,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>replied Virginia, `and I want to be loved by those only whom I love.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dearest daughter, you shall be entirely your own mistress; I will never interfere, either directly or indirectly, in the disposal of your heart.''

 (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div><p/>At these last words, Virginia, who had listened to all the rest unmoved, took her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) father's hand, and kissed it repeatedly.

<p/>``Now that I have found you, my darling child, let me at least make you happy, if I can -- it is the only atonement in my power, it will be the only solace of my declining years. All that wealth can bestow -- '

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Wealth!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>interrupted Virginia: `then you have wealth?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, my child -- may it make you happy! that is all the enjoyment I expect from it: it shall all be yours.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And may I do what I please with it? -- Oh, then it will indeed make me happy. I will give it all, all to Mr Hervey. How delightful to have something to give to Mr Hervey!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And had you never any thing to give to Mr Hervey till now?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never! never! he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) has given me every thing. Now -- oh, joyful day! -- I can prove to him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) that Virginia is not ungrateful!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear, generous girl,''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) father, wiping the tears from his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) eyes, `what a daughter have I found! But tell me, my child,<div class="bookquote">'' continued he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), smiling, `do you think Mr Hervey will be content if you give him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) only your fortune? Do you think that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) would accept the fortune without the heart? Nay, do not turn away that dear blushing face from me; remember it is your father who speaks to you. Mr Hervey will not take your fortune without yourself, I am afraid: what shall we do? Must I refuse him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) your hand?''

 (<font color='red'><b>child</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Refuse him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>)! do you think that I could refuse him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) any thing; who has given me every thing? -- I should be a monster indeed! There is no sacrifice I would not make, no exertion of which I am not capable, for Mr Hervey's sake. But, my dear father,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>), changing her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) tone, `he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) never asked for my hand till yesterday.''

<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) had won your heart long ago, I see, thought her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) father.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have written an answer to his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) letter; will you look at it, and tell me if you approve of it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do approve of it, my darling child: I will not read it -- I know what it must be: he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) has a right to the preference he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) has so nobly earned.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) has -- he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) has, indeed!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>cried Virginia, with an expression of strong feeling; `and now is the time to show him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) that I am not ungrateful.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How I love you for this, my child!''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>cried her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) father, fondly embracing her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``This is exactly what I wished, though I did not dare to say so till I was sure of your sentiments. Mr Hervey charged me to leave you entirely to yourself; he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) thought that your new situation might perhaps produce some change in your sentiments: I see he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) was mistaken; I am heartily glad of it. But you are going to say something, my dear; do not let me interrupt you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``I was only going to beg that you would give this letter, my dear father, to Mr Hervey. It is an answer to one which he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) wrote to me when I was poor' -- and deserted, she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) was near saying, but she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) stopped herself

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>continued she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``Mr Hervey should know that my sentiments are precisely the same now that they have always been. Tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>added she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>), proudly, `that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) did me injustice by that my sentiments could alter with my situation. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) little knows Virginia.'' Clarence at this moment entered the room, and Mr Hartley eagerly led his (<font color='blue'><b>Hartley</b></font>) daughter to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Hartley</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Take her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) hand,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>cried he (<font color='blue'><b>Hartley</b></font>); `you have her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) heart -- you deserve it, and she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) has just been very angry with me for doubting. But read her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) letter, -- that will speak better for her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>), and more to your satisfaction, no doubt, than I can.''

<p/>Virginia hastily put the letter into Mr Hervey's hand, and, breaking from her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) father, retired to her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) own apartment.

<p/>With all the trepidation of a person who feels that the happiness of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) life is to be decided in a few moments, Clarence tore open Virginia's letter, and, conscious that he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) was not able to command his (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) emotion, he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) withdrew from her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) father's inquiring eyes. Mr Hartley, however, saw nothing in this agitation but what he (<font color='blue'><b>Hartley</b></font>) thought natural to a lover, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Hartley</b></font>) was delighted to perceive that his (<font color='blue'><b>Hartley</b></font>) daughter had inspired so strong a passion.

<p/>Virginia's letter contained but these few lines:


<p/>``Most happy shall I be if the whole of my future life can prove to you how deeply I feel your goodness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``VIRGINIA ST PIERRE.''


 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>-LSB-End of C. Hervey's packet. -RSB-


<p/>An acceptance so direct left Clarence no alternative: his (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) fate was decided. He (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) determined immediately to force himself to see Belinda and Mr Vincent, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) fancied that his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) mind would be more at ease when he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) had convinced himself by ocular demonstration that she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) was absolutely engaged to another; that, consequently, even if he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) were free, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) could have no chance of gaining her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) affections. There are moments when we desire the conviction which at another time would overwhelm us with despair: it was in this temper that Mr Hervey paid his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) visit to Lady Delacour; but we have seen that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) was unable to support for many minutes that philosophic composure to which, at his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) first entrance into the room, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) had worked up his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) mind. The tranquillity which he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) had expected would be the consequences of this visit, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) was farther than ever from obtaining. The extravagant joy with which Lady Delacour received him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>), and an indescribable something in her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) manner when she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) looked from him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) to Belinda, and from Belinda to Mr Vincent, persuaded him (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) ladyship wished that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) were in Mr Vincent's place. The idea was so delightful, that his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) soul was entranced, and for a few minutes Virginia, and every thing that related to her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>), vanished from his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) remembrance. It was whilst he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) was in this state that Lady Delacour -LRB-as the reader may recollect-RRB- invited him (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) into her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) lord's dressing-room, to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) the contents of the packet, which had not then reached her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) hands. The request suddenly recalled him (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) senses, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) was not at this moment able to trust himself to her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) ladyship's penetration; he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) therefore referred her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) letter for that explanation which he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) dreaded to make in person, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) escaped from Belinda's presence, resolving never more to expose himself to such danger.

<p/>What effect his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) packet produced on Lady Delacour's mind and on Belinda's, we shall not at present stop to inquire; but having brought up Clarence Hervey's affairs to the present day, we shall continue his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) history.

<p/>CHAPTER XXVIII

<p/>E O

<p/>THOUGH Clarence Hervey was not much disposed to see either Virginia or her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) father whilst he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was in the state of perturbation into which he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had been thrown by his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) interview with Belinda, yet he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) did not delay to send his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) servant home with a note to Mrs Ormond, to say that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) would meet Mr Hartley, whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) pleased, at his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) lawyer's, to make whatever arrangements might be necessary for proper settlements.

<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) saw no possibility of receding with honour, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), with becoming resolution, desired to urge things forward as fast as possible, and to strengthen in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) mind the sense of the necessity of the sacrifice that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was bound to make. His (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) passions were naturally impetuous, but he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had by persevering efforts brought them under the subjection of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) reason. His (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) power over himself was now to be put to a severe trial.

<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was going to town, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) met Lord Delacour, who was riding in the park: he (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) was extremely intent upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) own thoughts, and was anxious to pass unnoticed. In former times this would have been the most feasible thing imaginable, for Lord Delacour used to detest the sight of Clarence Hervey, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) considered as the successor of Colonel Lawless in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lawless</b></font>) lady's favour; but his (<font color='blue'><b>Lawless</b></font>) opinion and his (<font color='blue'><b>Lawless</b></font>) feelings had been entirely changed by the perusal of those letters, which were perfumed with ottar of roses: even this perfume had, from that association, become agreeable to him (<font color='blue'><b>Lawless</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Lawless</b></font>) now accosted Clarence with a warmth and cordiality in his (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) manner that at any other moment must have pleased as much as it surprised him (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>); but Clarence was not in a humour to enter into conversation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You seem to be in haste, Mr Hervey,''  (<font color='red'><b>lordship</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) lordship, observing his (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) impatience; `but, as I know your good-nature, I shall make no scruple to detain you a quarter of an hour.''

<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) spoke he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) horse, and rode with Clarence, who looked as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) wished that his (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) lordship had been more scrupulous, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) had not such a reputation for good-nature.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You will not refuse me this quarter of an hour, I am sure,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Delacour</b></font>)</div>continued Lord Delacour, `when you hear that, by favouring me with your attention, you may perhaps materially serve an old, or rather a young, friend of yours, and one whom I once fancied was a particular favourite -- I mean, Miss Belinda Portman.''

<p/>At the name of Belinda Portman, Clarence Hervey became all attention: he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) assured his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) lordship that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) was in no haste; and all his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) difficulty now was to moderate the eagerness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) curiosity.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We can take a turn or two in the park, as well as any where,''  (<font color='red'><b>lordship</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) lordship: `nobody will overhear us, and the sooner you know what I have to say the better.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div>said Clarence.

<p/>The most malevolent person upon earth could not have tired poor Clarence's patience more than good-natured Lord Delacour contrived to do, with the best intentions possible, by his (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) habitual circumlocution.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) descanted at length upon the difficulties, as the world goes, of meeting with a confidential friend, whom it is prudent to trust in any affair that demands delicacy, honour, and address. Men of talents were often, he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) observed, devoid of integrity, and men of integrity devoid of talents. When he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had obtained Hervey's assent to this proposition, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) next paid him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) sundry handsome, but long-winded compliments: then he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) complimented himself for having just thought of Mr Hervey as the fittest person he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) could apply to: then he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) congratulated himself upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) good luck in meeting with the very man he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) was just thinking of. At last, after Clarence had returned thanks for all his (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) kindness, and had given assent to all his (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) lordship's truisms, the substance of the business came out.

<p/>Lord Delacour informed Mr Hervey, `that he (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) had been lately commissioned, by Lady Delacour, to discover what attractions drew a Mr Vincent so constantly to Mrs Luttridge's -- '

<p/>Here he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) was going to explain who Mr Vincent was; but Clarence assured him (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) knew perfectly well that he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) had been a ward of Mr Percival's, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) was a West Indian of large fortune, &c.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And a lover of Miss Portman's -- that is the most material part of the story to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>a West Indian c. lover</b></font>)</div>continued Lord Delacour, `for otherwise, you know, Mr Vincent would be no more to me than any other gentleman. But in that point of view -- I mean as a lover of Belinda Portman, and I may say, not quite unlikely to be her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) husband -- he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) is highly interesting to my Lady Delacour, and to me, and to you, as Miss Portman's well-wisher, doubtless.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Doubtless!''  (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div>was all Mr Hervey could reply.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, you must know,''  (<font color='red'><b>lordship Delacour</b></font>)</div>continued his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) lordship, `that Lady Delacour has, for a woman, an uncommon share of penetration, and can put things together in a wonderful way: in short, it has come to her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) -LRB-my Lady Delacour's-RRB- knowledge, that before Miss Portman was at Oakly-park last summer, and after she (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) left it this autumn, Mr Vincent was a constant visitor at Mrs Luttridge's. whilst at Harrowgate, and used to play high -LRB-though unknown to the Percivals, of course-RRB- at billiards with Mr Luttridge -- a man, I confess, I disliked always, even when I carried the election for them. But no matter: it is not from enmity I speak now. But it is very well known that Luttridge has but a small fortune, and yet lives as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Luttridge</b></font>) had a large one; and all the young men who like high play are sure to be well received at his (<font color='blue'><b>Luttridge</b></font>) house. Now, I hope Mr Vincent is not well received on that footing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Since my Lady Delacour and I have been such good friends,''  (<font color='red'><b>lordship</b></font>)</div>continued his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) lordship, <div class="bookquote">``I have dropped all connexion with the Luttridge's; so cannot go there myself: moreover, I do not wish to be tempted to lose any more thousands to the lady. But you never play, and you are not likely to be tempted to it now; so you will oblige me and Lady Delacour if you will go to Luttridge's to-night: she (<font color='blue'><b>Luttridge</b></font>) is always charmed to see you, and you will easily discover how the land lies. Mr Vincent is certainly a very agreeable, open-hearted young man; but, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) game, God forbid that Miss Portman should ever be his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) wife!''

 (<font color='red'><b>lordship</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``God forbid!''  (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div>said Clarence Hervey.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The man,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Delacour</b></font>)</div>resumed Lord Delacour, `must, in my opinion, be very superior indeed who is deserving of Belinda Portman. Oh, Mr Hervey, you do not -- you cannot know her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) merit, as I do. It is one thing, sir, to see a fine girl in a ball-room, and another -- quite another -- to live in the house with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) for months, and to see her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), as I have seen Belinda Portman, in every-day life, as one may call it. Then it is one can judge of the real temper, manners, and character and never woman had so sweet a temper, such charming manners, such a fair, open, generous, decided yet gentle character, as this Miss Portman.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your lordship speaks con amore,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div>said Clarence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I speak, Mr Hervey, from the bottom of my soul,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Delacour</b></font>)</div>cried Lord Delacour, pulling in his (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) horse, and stopping short. <div class="bookquote">``I should be an unfeeling, ungrateful brute, if I were not sensible of the obligations -- yes, the obligations -- which my Lady Delacour and I have received from Belinda Portman. Why, sir, she (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) has been the peacemaker between us -- but we will not talk of that now. Let us think of her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) affairs. If Mr Vincent once gets into Mrs Luttridge's cursed set, there's no knowing where it will end. I speak from my own experience, for I really never was fond of high play and yet, when I got into that set, I could not withstand it. I lost by hundreds and thousands; and so will he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>), before he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) is aware of it, no doubt. Mrs Luttridge will look upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) as her (<font color='blue'><b>Luttridge</b></font>) dupe, and make him (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) such. I always -- but this is between ourselves -- suspected that I did not lose my last thousand to her (<font color='blue'><b>Luttridge</b></font>) fairly. Now, Hervey, you know the whole, do try and save Mr Vincent, for Belinda Portman's sake.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div><p/>Clarence Hervey shook hands with Lord Delacour, with a sentiment of real gratitude and affection; and assured him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) that his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) confidence was not misplaced. His (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) lordship little suspected that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) had been soliciting him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) to save his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) rival. Clarence's love was not of that selfish sort which the moment that it is deprived of hope sinks into indifference, or is converted into hatred. Belinda could not be his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>); but, in the midst of the bitterest regret, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) was supported by the consciousness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) own honour and generosity: he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) felt a noble species of delight in the prospect of promoting the happiness of the woman upon whom his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) fondest affections had been fixed; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) rejoiced to feel that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) had sufficient magnanimity to save a rival from ruin. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) was even determined to make that rival his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) friend, notwithstanding the prepossession which, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) clearly perceived, Mr Vincent felt against him (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``His (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) jealousy will be extinguished the moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) knows my real situation,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div>said Clarence to himself. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) will be convinced that I have a soul incapable of envy; and, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) suspect my love for Belinda, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) will respect the strength of mind with which I can command my passions. I take it for granted that Mr Vincent must possess a heart and understanding such as I should desire in a friend, or he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) could never be -- what he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) is to Belinda.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div><p/>Full of these generous sentiments, Clarence waited with impatience for the hour when he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) might present himself at Mrs Luttridge's. He (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) went there so early in the evening, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) found the drawing-room quite empty; the company, who had been invited to dine, had not yet left the dining-room, and the servants had but just set the card-tables and lighted the candles. Mr Hervey desired that nobody should be disturbed by his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) coming so early; and fortunately Mrs Luttridge was detained some minutes by Lady Newland's lingering glass of Madeira. In the mean time, Clarence executed his (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) design. From his (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) former observations, and from the hints that Lord Delacour had let fall, he (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) suspected that there was sometimes in this house not only high play, but foul play: he (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) recollected that once, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) played there at billiards, he (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) had perceived that the table was not perfectly horizontal; and it occurred to him (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>), that perhaps the E O table might be so contrived as to put the fortunes of all who played at it in the power of the proprietor. Clarence had sufficient ingenuity to invent the method by which this might be done; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) had the infallible means in his (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) possession of detecting the fraud. The E O table was in an apartment adjoining to the drawing-room: he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) found his (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) way to it, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) discovered, beyond a possibility of doubt, that it was constructed for the purposes of fraud. His (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) first impulse was to tell this immediately to Mr Vincent, to put him (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) on his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) guard; but, upon reflection, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) determined to keep his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) discovery to himself, till he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) was satisfied whether that gentleman had or had not any passion for play.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) have,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div>thought Clarence, `it is of the utmost consequence to Miss Portman that he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) should early in life receive a shock that may leave an indelible impression upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) mind. To save him (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) a few hours of remorse, I will not give up the power of doing him (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) the most essential service. I will let him (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) go on -- if he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) be so inclined -- to the very verge of ruin and despair: I will let him (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) feel all the horrors of a gambler's fate, before I tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) that I have the means to save him (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>). Mrs Luttridge must, when I call upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Luttridge</b></font>), refund whatever he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) may lose: she (<font color='blue'><b>Luttridge</b></font>) will not brave public shame -- she (<font color='blue'><b>Luttridge</b></font>) cannot stand a public prosecution.''

<p/>Scarcely had Clarence arranged his (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) scheme, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) heard the voices of the ladies, who were coming up stairs.

<p/>Mrs Luttridge made her (<font color='blue'><b>Luttridge</b></font>) appearance, accompanied by a very pretty, modish, affected young lady, Miss Annabella Luttridge, her (<font color='blue'><b>Luttridge</b></font>) niece. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Luttridge</b></font>) little coquettish airs were lost upon Clarence Hervey, whose eye was intently fixed upon the door, watching for the entrance of Mr Vincent. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) was one of the dinner party, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) came up soon after the ladies. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) seemed prepared for the sight of Mr Hervey, to whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) bowed with a cold, haughty air; and then addressed himself to Miss Annabella Luttridge, who showed the most obvious desire to attract his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) attention.

<p/>From all that passed this evening, Mr Hervey was led to suspect, notwithstanding the reasons which made it apparently improbable, that the fair Annabella was the secret cause of Mr Vincent's frequent visits at her (<font color='blue'><b>Annabella</b></font>) aunt's. It was natural that Clarence should be disposed to this opinion, from the circumstances of his (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) own situation. During three hours that he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) stayed at Mrs Luttridge's, Mr Vincent never joined any of the parties at play; but, just as he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) was going away, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) heard some one say -- <div class="bookquote">``How comes it, Vincent, that you've been idle all night?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>This question revived Mr Hervey's suspicions; and, uncertain what report he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) should make to Lord Delacour, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) resolved to defer making any, till he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) had farther opportunities of judging.

<p/>When Mr Hervey asked himself how it was possible that the pupil of Mr Percival could become a gamester, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) forgot that Mr Vincent had not been educated by his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) guardian; that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) had lived in the West Indies till he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) was eighteen; and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) had only been under the care of Mr Percival for a few years, after his (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) habits and character were in a great measure formed. The taste for gambling he (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) had acquired whilst he (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) was a child; but, as it was then confined to trifles, it had been passed over, as a thing of no consequence, a boyish folly, that would never grow up with him (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>): his (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) father used to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>), day after day, playing with eagerness at games of chance, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) negroes, or with the sons of neighbouring planters; yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) was never alarmed: he (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) was too intent upon making a fortune for his (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) family to consider how they would spend it, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) did not foresee that this boyish fault might be the means of his (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) son's losing, in a few hours, the wealth which he (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) had been many years amassing. When young Vincent came over to England, Mr Percival had not immediate opportunities of discovering this particular foible in his (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) ward; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) perceived that in his (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) mind there was that presumptuous belief in his (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) special good fortune which naturally leads to the love of gambling. Instead of lecturing him (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>), his (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) guardian appealed to his (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) understanding, and took opportunities of showing him (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) the ruinous effects of high play in real life. Young Vincent was touched, and, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) thought, convinced; but his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) emotion was stronger than his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) conviction -- his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) feelings were always more powerful than his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) reason. His (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) detestation of the selfish character of a gamester was felt and expressed with enthusiasm and eloquence; and his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) indignation rose afterwards at the slightest hint that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) might ever in future be tempted to become what he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) abhorred. Unfortunately he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) disdained prudence, as the factitious virtue of inferior minds: he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) thought that the feelings of a man of honour were to be his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) guide in the first and last appeal; and for his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) conduct through life, as a man and as a gentleman, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) proudly professed to trust to the sublime instinct of a good heart. His (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) guardian's doubts of the infallibility and even of the existence of this moral instinct wounded Mr Vincent's pride instead of alarming his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) understanding; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) was rather eager than averse to expose himself to the danger, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) might prove his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) superiority to the temptation. How different are the feelings in different situations! Yet often as this has been repeated, how difficult it is to impress the truth upon inexperienced, sanguine minds! -- Whilst young Vincent was immediately under his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) guardian's eye at Oakly-park, his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) safety from vice appeared to him (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) inglorious; he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) was impatient to sally forth into the world, confident rather of his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) innate than acquired virtue.

<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) first became acquainted with Mrs Luttridge at Harrowgate, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) knew that she (<font color='blue'><b>Luttridge</b></font>) was a professed gambler, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) despised the character, yet without reflecting on the danger, or perhaps for the pleasure of convincing Mr Percival that he (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) was superior to it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) continued his (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) visits. For some time he (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) was a passive spectator. Billiards, however, was a game of address, not chance; there was a billiard-table at Oakly-park, as well as at Mr Luttridge's, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Luttridge</b></font>) had played with his (<font color='blue'><b>Luttridge</b></font>) guardian. Why, then, should he (<font color='blue'><b>Luttridge</b></font>) not play with Mr Luttridge? He (<font color='blue'><b>Luttridge</b></font>) did play; his (<font color='blue'><b>Luttridge</b></font>) skill was admired; he (<font color='blue'><b>Luttridge</b></font>) betted, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Luttridge</b></font>) bets were successful; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Luttridge</b></font>) did not call this gaming, for the bets were not to any great amount, and it was only playing at billiards. Mr Percival was delayed in town some weeks longer than usual, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) knew nothing of the manner in which his (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) young friend spent his (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) time. As soon as Mr Vincent heard of his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) arrival at Oakly-park, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) left half finished his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) game at billiards; and, fortunately for him (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>), the charms of Belinda made him (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) forget for some months that such a thing as a billiard-table existed. All that had happened at Mr Luttridge's passed from his (<font color='blue'><b>Luttridge</b></font>) mind as a dream; and whilst his (<font color='blue'><b>Luttridge</b></font>) heart was agitated by his (<font color='blue'><b>Luttridge</b></font>) new passion, he (<font color='blue'><b>Luttridge</b></font>) could scarcely believe that he (<font color='blue'><b>Luttridge</b></font>) had ever been interested by any other feelings. He (<font color='blue'><b>Luttridge</b></font>) was surprised when he (<font color='blue'><b>Luttridge</b></font>) accidentally recollected the eagerness with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Luttridge</b></font>) used to amuse himself in Mr Luttridge's company, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Luttridge</b></font>) was certain that all this was passed for ever; and precisely because he (<font color='blue'><b>Luttridge</b></font>) was under the dominion of one strong passion, he (<font color='blue'><b>Luttridge</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Luttridge</b></font>) could never be under the dominion of another. Thus persisting in his (<font color='blue'><b>Luttridge</b></font>) disdain of reason as a moral guide, Mr Vincent thought, acted, and suffered as a man of feeling. Scarcely had Belinda left Oakly-park for one week when the ennui consequent to violent passion became insupportable; and to console himself for her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) absence he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) flew to the billiard-table. Emotion of some kind or other was become necessary to him (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) said that not to feel was not to live; and soon the suspense, the anxiety, the hopes, the fears, the perpetual vicissitudes of a gamester's life, seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) almost as delightful as those of a lover's. Deceived by these appearances, Mrs Luttridge thought that his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) affection for Belinda either was or might be conquered, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Luttridge</b></font>) hopes of obtaining his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) fortune for her (<font color='blue'><b>Luttridge</b></font>) niece Annabella revived. As Mr Vincent could not endure Mrs Freke, she (<font color='blue'><b>Freke</b></font>) abstained, at her (<font color='blue'><b>Freke</b></font>) friend's particular desire, from appearing at her (<font color='blue'><b>Freke</b></font>) house whilst he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) was there, and Mrs Luttridge interested him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) much in her (<font color='blue'><b>Luttridge</b></font>) own favour, by representing her (<font color='blue'><b>Luttridge</b></font>) indignation at Harriot's conduct to be such that it had occasioned a total breach in their friendship. Mrs Freke's sudden departure from Harrowgate confirmed the probability of this quarrel; yet these two ladies were secretly leagued together in a design of breaking off Mr Vincent's match with Belinda, against whom Mrs Freke had vowed revenge. The anonymous letter, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Freke</b></font>) hoped would work her (<font color='blue'><b>Freke</b></font>) purpose, produced, however, an effect totally unexpected upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) generous mind: he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) did not guess the writer; but his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) indignation against such base accusations burst forth with a violence that astounded Mrs Luttridge. His (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) love for Belinda appeared ten times more enthusiastic than before -- the moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) was accused, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) felt himself her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) defender, as well as her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) lover. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) was dispossessed of the evil spirit of gambling as if by a miracle; and the billiard-table, and Mrs Luttridge, and Miss Annabella, vanished from his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) view. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) breathed nothing but love; he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) would ask no permission, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) would wait for none from Belinda: he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) declared that instant he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) would set out in search of her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) would tear that infamous letter to atoms in her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) presence; he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) would show her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) how impossible suspicion was to his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) nature. The first violence of the hurricane Mrs Luttridge could not stand, and thought not of opposing; but whilst his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) horses and curricle were getting ready, she (<font color='blue'><b>Luttridge</b></font>) took such an affectionate leave of his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) dog Juba, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Luttridge</b></font>) protested so much that she (<font color='blue'><b>Luttridge</b></font>) and Annabella should not know how to live without poor Juba, that Mr Vincent, who was excessively fond of his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) dog, could not help sympathizing in their sorrow: reasoning just as well as they wished, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) extended his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) belief in their affection for this animal to friendship, if not love, for his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) master. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) could not grant Mrs Luttridge's earnest supplication to leave the dog behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) under her (<font color='blue'><b>Luttridge</b></font>) protection, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) promised -- and laid his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) hand upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) heart when he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) promised -- that Juba should wait upon Mrs Luttridge as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Luttridge</b></font>) went to town. This appointment being made, Miss Annabella permitted herself to be somewhat consoled. It would be injustice to omit that she (<font color='blue'><b>Annabella</b></font>) did all that could be done by a cambric handkerchief to evince delicate sensibility in this parting scene. Mrs Luttridge also deserves her (<font color='blue'><b>Luttridge</b></font>) share of praise for the manner in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Luttridge</b></font>) reproved her (<font color='blue'><b>Luttridge</b></font>) niece for giving way to her (<font color='blue'><b>Luttridge</b></font>) feelings, and for the address with which she (<font color='blue'><b>Luttridge</b></font>) wished to Heaven that poor Annabella had the calm philosophic temper of which Miss Portman was, she (<font color='blue'><b>Annabella</b></font>) understood, a most uncommon example.

<p/>As Mr Vincent drove toward London he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) reflected upon these last words; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) could not help thinking that if Belinda had more faults she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) would be more amiable.

<p/>These thoughts were, however, driven from his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) mind, and scarcely left a trace behind them, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) once more saw and conversed with her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>). The dignity, sincerity, and kindness which she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) showed the evening that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) put the anonymous letter into her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) hands charmed and touched him (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>), and his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) real feelings and his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) enthusiasm conspired to make him (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) believe that his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) whole happiness depended on her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) smiles. The confession which she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) made to him (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) of her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) former attachment to Clarence Hervey, as it raised in Vincent's mind strong emotions of jealousy, increased his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) passion as much as it piqued his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) pride; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) appeared in a new and highly interesting light when he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) discovered that the coldness of manner which he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) had attributed to want of sensibility arose probably from its excess -- that her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) heart should have been preoccupied was more tolerable to him (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) than the belief of her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) settled indifference. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) was so intent upon these delightful varieties in his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) love for Belinda that it was not till he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) had received a reproachful note from Mrs Luttridge, to remind him (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) of his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) promised visit with Juba, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) could prevail upon himself to leave Twickenham, even for a few hours. Lady Delacour's hatred or fear of Juba, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) accidentally mentioned to Miss Annabella, appeared to her (<font color='blue'><b>Annabella</b></font>) and to her (<font color='blue'><b>Annabella</b></font>) aunt `the most extraordinary thing upon earth;' and when it was contrasted with their excessive fondness, it seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) indeed unaccountable. From pure consideration for her (<font color='blue'><b>Annabella</b></font>) ladyship's nerves, Mrs Luttridge petitioned Vincent to leave the dog with her (<font color='blue'><b>Luttridge</b></font>), that Helena might not be in such imminent danger from `the animal's monstrous jaws.'' The petition was granted; and as the petitioners foresaw, Juba became to them a most useful auxiliary. Juba's master called daily to see him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>), and sometimes when he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) came in the morning Mrs Luttridge was not at home, so that his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) visits were repeated in the evening; and the evening in London is what in other places is called the night. Mrs Luttridge's nights could not be passed without deep play. The sight of the E O table at first shocked Mr Vincent: he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) thought of Mr Percival, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) turned away from it; but to his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) active social disposition it was extremely irksome to stand idle and uninterested where all were busy and eager in one common pursuit; to his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) generous temper it seemed ungentlemanlike to stand by the silent censor of the rest of the company; and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) considered of how little importance a few hundreds or even thousands could be to a man of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) large fortune, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could not help feeling that it was sordid, selfish, avaricious, to dread their possible loss; and thus social spirit, courage, generosity, all conspired to carry our man of feeling to the gaming-table. Once there, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ruin was inevitable. Mrs Luttridge, whilst she (<font color='blue'><b>Luttridge</b></font>) held his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) doom in her (<font color='blue'><b>Luttridge</b></font>) power, hesitated only whether it would be more her (<font color='blue'><b>Luttridge</b></font>) interest to marry him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to her (<font color='blue'><b>Luttridge</b></font>) niece, or to content herself with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fortune. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) passion for Belinda, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) saw had been by some means or other increased, in spite of the anonymous letter, gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) little hopes of Annabella's succeeding, even with the assistance of Juba and delicate sensibility. So the aunt, careless of her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) niece's disappointment, determined that Mr Vincent should be her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) victim; and sensible that she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) must not give him (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) time for reflection, she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) hurried him (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) on, till, in the course of a few evenings spent at the E O table, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) lost not only thousands, but tens of thousands. One lucky night, she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) assured him (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>), would set all to rights; the run could not always be against him (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>), and fortune must change in his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) favour, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) tried her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) with sufficient perseverance.

<p/>The horror, the agony of mind, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) endured at this sudden ruin which seemed impending over him (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) -- the recollection of Belinda, of Mr Percival, almost drove him (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) to distraction. He (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) retreated from the E O table one night, swearing that he (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) never would hazard another guinea. But his (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) ruin was not yet complete -- he (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) had thousands yet to lose, and Mrs Luttridge would not thus relinquish her (<font color='blue'><b>Luttridge</b></font>) prey. She (<font color='blue'><b>Luttridge</b></font>) persuaded him (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) to try his (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) fortune once more. She (<font color='blue'><b>Luttridge</b></font>) now suffered him (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) to regain courage, by winning back some of his (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) own money. His (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) mind was relieved from the sense of immediate danger; he (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) rejoiced to be saved from the humiliation of confessing his (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) losses to Mr Percival and Belinda. The next day he (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) with unusual pleasure, and this was the very morning Clarence Hervey paid his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) visit. The imprudence of Lady Delacour, joined perhaps to his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) own consciousness that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) had a secret fault, which ought to lower him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) in the esteem of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) mistress, made him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) misinterpret every thing that passed -- his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) jealousy was excited in the most sudden and violent manner. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) flew from Lady Delacour's to Mrs Luttridge's -- he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) was soothed and flattered by the apparent kindness with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) was received by Annabella and her (<font color='blue'><b>Annabella</b></font>) aunt, but after dinner, when one of the servants whispered to Mrs Luttridge, who sat next to him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>), that Mr Clarence Hervey was above stairs, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) gave such a start, that the fair Annabella's lap did not escape a part of the bumper of wine which he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) was going to drink to her (<font color='blue'><b>Annabella</b></font>) health. In the confusion and apologies which this accident occasioned, Mrs Luttridge had time to consider what might be the cause of the start, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Luttridge</b></font>) combined her (<font color='blue'><b>Luttridge</b></font>) suspicions so quickly and judiciously that she (<font color='blue'><b>Luttridge</b></font>) guessed the truth -- that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) feared to be seen at the E O table by a person who might find it for his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) interest to tell the truth to Belinda Portman. <div class="bookquote">``Mr Vincent,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>), in a low voice, <div class="bookquote">``I have such a terrible headache, that I am fit for nothing -- I am not up to E O to-night, so you must wait your revenge till to-morrow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr Vincent was heartily glad to be relieved from his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) engagement, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) endeavoured to escape Clarence's suspicions, by devoting his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) whole time this evening to Annabella, not in the least apprehensive that Mr Hervey would return the next night. Mr Vincent was at the E O table at the usual hour, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) was excessively anxious to regain what he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) had lost, not so much for the sake of the money, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) could afford to lose, but lest the defalcation in his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) fortune should lead Mr Percival to the knowledge of the means which had occasioned it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) could not endure, after his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) high vaunts, to see himself humbled by his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) rash confidence in himself, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) secretly vowed, that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) could but reinstate himself, by one night's good luck, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) would for ever quit the society of gamblers. A few months before this time, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) would have scorned the idea of concealing any part of his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) conduct, any one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) actions, from his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) best friend, Mr Percival; but his (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) pride now reconciled him (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) to the meanness of concealment; and here, the acuteness of him (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) feelings was to his (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) own mind an excuse for dissimulation: so fallacious is moral instinct, unenlightened or uncontrolled by reason and religion.

<p/>Mr Vincent was disappointed in his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) hopes of regaining what he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) had lost. This was not the fortunate night, which Mrs Luttridge's prognostics had vainly taught him (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) to expect: he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) played on, however, with all the impetuosity of his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) natural temper; his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) judgment forsook him (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) scarcely knew what he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) said or did; and, in the course of a few hours, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) was worked up to such a pitch of insanity, that in one desperate moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) betted nearly all that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) was worth in the world -- and lost! He (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) stood like one stupefied: the hum of voices scarcely reached his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) ear -- he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) saw figures moving before him (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>); but he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) did not distinguish who or what they were.

<p/>Supper was announced, and the room emptied fast, whilst he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) remained motionless leaning on the E O table. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) was roused by Mrs Luttridge saying, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Luttridge</b></font>) passed, <div class="bookquote">``Don't you sup tonight, Mr Hervey?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>-- Vincent looked up, and saw Clarence Hervey opposite to him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>). His (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) countenance instantly changed, and the lightning of anger flashed through the gloom of despair: he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) uttered not a syllable; but his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) looks said, <div class="bookquote">``How is this, sir? Here again to-night to watch me? -- to enjoy my ruin? -- to be ready to carry the first news of it to Belinda?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>At this last thought, Vincent struck his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) closed hand with violence against his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) forehead; and rushing by Mr Hervey, who in vain attempted to speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) pressed into the midst of the crowd on the stairs, and let himself be carried along with them into the supper-room. At supper he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) usual seat between Mrs Luttridge and the fair Annabella; and, as if determined to brave the observing eyes of Clarence Hervey, who was at the same table, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) affected extravagant gaiety; he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) ate, drank, talked, and laughed, more than any of the company. Toward the end of the supper, his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) dog, who was an inmate of Mrs Luttridge's, licked his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) hand to put him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) in mind that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) had given him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) nothing to eat.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Drink, Juba! -- drink, and never have done, boy!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr Vincent/Vincent</b></font>)</div>cried Vincent, holding a bumper of wine to the dog's mouth; `he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>)'s the only dog I ever saw taste wine.'' Then snatching up some of the flowers, which ornamented the table, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) swore that Juba should henceforward be called Anacreon, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) deserved to be crowned with roses by the hand of beauty. The fair Annabella instantly took a hothouse rose from her (<font color='blue'><b>Annabella</b></font>) bosom, and assisted in making the garland, with which she (<font color='blue'><b>Annabella</b></font>) crowned the new Anacreon. Insensible to his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) honours, the dog, who was extremely hungry, turned suddenly to Mrs Luttridge, by whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) had, till this night, regularly been fed with the choicest morsels, and lifting up his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) huge paw, laid it, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) had been wont to do, upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Luttridge</b></font>) arm. She (<font color='blue'><b>Luttridge</b></font>) shook it off: he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>), knowing nothing of the change in his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) master's affairs, laid the paw again upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Luttridge</b></font>) arm; and with that familiarity to which he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) had long been encouraged, raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) head almost close to the lady's cheek.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Down Juba! -- down, sir, down!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Luttridge/Luttridge</b></font>)</div>cried Mrs Luttridge, in a sharp voice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Down, Juba! -- down, sir!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr Vincent/Vincent</b></font>)</div>repeated Mr Vincent, in a tone of bitter feeling, all his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) assumed gaiety forsaking him (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) at this instant: <div class="bookquote">``Down, Juba! -- down, sir, down!''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>as low as your master, thought he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>); and pushing back his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) chair, he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) rose from table, and precipitately left the room.

<p/>Little notice was taken of his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) retreat; the chairs closed in; and the gap which his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) vacant place left was visible but for a moment: the company were as gay as before; the fair Annabella smiled with a grace as attractive; and Mrs Luttridge exulted in the success of her (<font color='blue'><b>Luttridge</b></font>) schemes -- whilst her (<font color='blue'><b>Luttridge</b></font>) victim was in the agonies of despair.

<p/>Clarence Hervey, who had watched every change of Vincent's countenance, saw the agony of soul with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) rose from the table, and quitted the room: he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) suspected his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) purpose, and followed him (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) immediately; but Mr Vincent had gone out of the house before he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) could overtake him (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>); which way he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) was gone no one could tell, for no one had seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>); the only information he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) could gain was, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) might possibly be heard of at Nerot's Hotel, or at Governor Montford's, in Portland-place. The hotel was but a few yards from Mrs Luttridge's. Clarence went there directly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) asked for Mr Vincent. One of the waiters said that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) was not yet come in; but another called out, <div class="bookquote">``Mr Vincent, sir, did you say? I have just shown him (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) up to his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) room.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Which is the room? -- I must see him (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) instantly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div>cried Hervey.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not to-night -- you can't see him (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) now, sir. Mr Vincent won't let you in, I can assure you, sir. I went up myself three minutes ago, with some letters, that came whilst he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) was away, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) would not let me in. I heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) double-lock the door, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) swore terribly. I can't go up again at this time o'night -- for my life I dare not, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Where is his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) own man? -- Has Mr Vincent any servant here? -- Mr Vincent's man!''  (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div>cried Clarence; `let me see him (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>)!''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You can't sir. Mr Vincent has just sent his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) black, the only servant he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) has here, out on some message. Indeed, sir, there's no use in going up,''  (<font color='red'><b>the waiter</b></font>)</div>continued the waiter, as Clarence sprang up two or three stairs at once: <div class="bookquote">``Mr Vincent has desired nobody may disturb him (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>). I give you my word, sir, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>)'ll be very angry; and, besides, `twould be to no purpose, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>)'ll not unlock the door.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is there but one door to the room?''  (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div>said Mr Hervey; and, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) asked the question, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) pulled a guinea out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) pocket, and touched the waiter's hand with it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, now I recollect -- yes, sir, there's a private door through a closet: may be that mayn't be fastened.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div><p/>Clarence put the guinea into the waiter's hand, who instantly showed him (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) the way up the back staircase to the door that opened into Mr Vincent's bed-chamber.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Leave me now,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>whispered he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>), `and make no noise.''

<p/>The man withdrew; and as Mr Hervey went close to the concealed door, to try if it was fastened, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) distinctly heard a pistol cocked. The door was not fastened: he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) pushed it softly open, and saw the unfortunate man upon his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knees, the pistol in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes looking up to heaven. Clarence was in one moment behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>); and seizing hold of the pistol, he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) snatched it from Vincent's grasp with so much calm presence of mind and dexterity, that, although the pistol was cocked, it did not go off.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr Hervey!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr Vincent/Vincent</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Vincent, starting up. Astonishment overpowered all other sensations. But the next instant recovering the power of speech, <div class="bookquote">``Is this the conduct of a gentleman, Mr Hervey -- of a man of honour,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>cried he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>), `thus to intrude upon my privacy; to be a spy upon my actions, to triumph in my ruin; to witness my despair; to rob me of the only -- '

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) looked wildly at the pistol which Clarence held in his (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) hand; then snatched up another, which lay upon the table, he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) continued, <div class="bookquote">``You are my enemy -- I know it; you are my rival; I know it; Belinda loves you! Nay, affect not to start -- this is no time for dissimulation -- Belinda loves you -- you know it: for her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) sake, for your own, put me out of the world -- put me out of torture. It shall not be called murder: it shall be called a duel. You have been a spy upon my actions -- I demand satisfaction. If you have one spark of honour or of courage within you, Mr Hervey, show it now -- fight me, sir, openly as man to man, rival to rival, enemy to enemy -- fire.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you fire upon me, you will repent it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div>replied Clarence, calmly; `for I am not your enemy -- I am not your rival.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr Vincent/Vincent</b></font>)</div>interrupted Vincent, raising his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) voice to the highest pitch of indignation: `you are my rival, though you dare not avow it! The denial is base, false, unmanly. Oh, Belinda, is this the being you prefer to me? Gamester -- wretch, as I am, my soul never stooped to falsehood! Treachery I abhor; courage, honour, and a heart worthy of Belinda, I possess. I beseech you, sir,'' continued he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>), addressing himself, in a tremulous tone of contempt, to Mr Hervey, <div class="bookquote">``I beseech you, sir, to leave me to my own feelings -- and to myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are not yourself at this moment, and I cannot leave you to such mistaken feelings,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div>replied Hervey: `command yourself for a moment, and hear me; use your reason, and you will soon be convinced that I am your friend.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My friend!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Your friend. For what purpose did I come here? To snatch this pistol from your hand? If it were my interest, my wish, that you were out of the world, why did I prevent your from destroying yourself? Do you think that the action of an enemy? Use your reason.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I cannot,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr Vincent/Vincent</b></font>)</div>said Vincent, striking his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) forehead; <div class="bookquote">``I know not what to think -- I am not master of myself. I conjure you, sir, for your own sake, to leave me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr Vincent/Vincent</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``For my own sake!''  (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div>repeated Hervey, disdainfully: <div class="bookquote">``I am not thinking of myself; nor can any thing you have said provoke me from my purpose. My purpose is to save you from ruin, for the sake of a woman, whom, though I am no longer your rival, I have loved longer, if not better, than you have.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div><p/>There was something so open in Hervey's countenance, such a strong expression of truth in his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) manner, that it could not be resisted, and Vincent, in an altered voice, exclaimed, <div class="bookquote">``You acknowledge that you have loved Belinda -- and could you cease to love her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>)? Impossible! -- And, loving her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>), must you not detest me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr Vincent/Vincent</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div>said Clarence, holding out his (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) hand to him (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``I wish to be your friend. I have not the baseness to wish to deprive others of happiness because I cannot enjoy it myself. In one word, to put you at ease with me for ever, I have no pretensions, I can have none, to Miss Portman. I am engaged to another woman -- in a few days you will hear of my marriage.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr Vincent threw the pistol from him (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>), and gave his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) hand to Hervey.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Pardon what I said to you just now,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>cried he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``I knew not what I said -- I spoke in the agony of despair: your purpose is most generous -- but it is in vain -- you come too late -- I am ruined, past all hope.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) folded his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) arms, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) eyes reverted involuntarily to his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) pistols.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The misery that you have this night experienced,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div>said Mr Hervey, `was necessary to the security of your future happiness.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Happiness!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr Vincent/Vincent</b></font>)</div>repeated Vincent; `happiness -- there is no happiness left for me. My doom is fixed -- fixed by my own folly -- my own rash, headstrong folly. Madman that I was, what could tempt me to the gaming-table? Oh! If I could recall but a few days, a few hours of my existence! But remorse is vain -- prudence comes too late. Do you know,<div class="bookquote">'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>), fixing his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) eyes upon Hervey, `do you know that I am a beggar? That I have not a farthing left upon earth? Go to Belinda; tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) so: tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>), that if she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) had ever the slightest regard for me, I deserve it no longer. Tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) to forget, despise, detest me. Give her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) joy that she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) has escaped having a gamester for a husband.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div>said Clarence, <div class="bookquote">``I will, if you please, tell her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) what I believe to be true, that the agony you have felt this night, the dear-bought experience you have had, will be for ever a warning.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A warning!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr Vincent/Vincent</b></font>)</div>interrupted Vincent: <div class="bookquote">``Oh, that it could yet be useful to me! -- But I tell you it comes too late -- nothing can save me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr Vincent/Vincent</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div>said Mr Hervey. <div class="bookquote">``Swear to me, for Belinda's sake -- solemnly swear to me, that you will never more trust your happiness and hers to the hazard of a die -- swear that you will never more, directly or indirectly, play at any game of chance, and I will restore to you the fortune that you have lost.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr Vincent/Vincent</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr Vincent stood as if suspended between ecstasy and despair: he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) dared not trust his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) senses: with a fervent and solemn adjuration he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) made the vow that was required of him (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>); and Clarence then revealed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) the secret of the E O table.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``When Mrs Luttridge knows that I have it in my power to expose her (<font color='blue'><b>Luttridge</b></font>) to public shame, she (<font color='blue'><b>Luttridge</b></font>) will instantly refund all that she (<font color='blue'><b>Luttridge</b></font>) has iniquitously won from you. Even among gamblers she (<font color='blue'><b>Luttridge</b></font>) would blasted for ever by this discovery: she (<font color='blue'><b>Luttridge</b></font>) knows it, and if she (<font color='blue'><b>Luttridge</b></font>) dared to brave public opinion, we have then a sure resource in the law -- prosecute her (<font color='blue'><b>Luttridge</b></font>). The laws of honour, as well as the laws of the land, will support the prosecution. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Luttridge</b></font>) will never let the affair go into a court of justice. I will see her (<font color='blue'><b>Luttridge</b></font>) early, as early as I can to-morrow, and put you out of suspense.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Most generous of human beings!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr Vincent/Vincent</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Vincent; ``I cannot express to you what I feel, but your own heart, your own approbation -- '

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Farewell, good night,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr Vincent/Vincent</b></font>)</div>interrupted Clarence; <div class="bookquote">``I see that I have made a friend -- I was determined that Belinda's husband should be my friend -- I have succeeded beyond my hopes. And now I will intrude no longer,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>), as he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) closed the door after him (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>). His (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) sensations at this instant were more delightful even than those of the man he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) had relieved from the depth of despair. How wisely has Providence made the benevolent and generous passions the most pleasurable!

<p/>CHAPTER XXIX

<p/>A Jew

<p/>IN the silence of the night, when the hurry of action was over, and the enthusiasm of generosity began to subside, the words, which had escaped from Mr Vincent in the paroxysm of despair and rage -- the words, ``Belinda loves you ' -- recurred to Clarence Hervey; and it required all his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) power over himself to banish the sound from his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) ear, and the idea from his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) mind. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) endeavoured to persuade himself there could be no real foundation for the assertion: perhaps this belief was a necessary support to his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) integrity. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) reflected, that, at all events, his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) engagement with Virginia could not be violated; his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) proffered services to Mr Vincent could not be withdrawn: he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) was firm and consistent. Before two o'clock the next day, Vincent received from Clarence this short note:


<p/>``Enclosed in Mrs Luttridge's acknowledgment, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Luttridge</b></font>) has no claims upon you, in consequence of what passed last night. I said nothing about the money she (<font color='blue'><b>Luttridge</b></font>) had previously won, as I understand you have paid it.
``The lady fell into fits, but it would not do. The husband attempted to bully me; I told him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) I should be at his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) service, after he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had made the whole affair public, by calling you out.

<p/>``I would have seen you myself this morning, but that I am engaged with lawyers and marriage settlements.

<p/>``Yours sincerely,
<div class="bookquote">``CLARENCE HERVEY.''


 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Luttridge/Luttridge</b></font>)</div><p/>Overjoyed at the sight of Mrs Luttridge's acknowledgment, Vincent repeated his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) vow never more to hazard himself in her (<font color='blue'><b>Luttridge</b></font>) dangerous society. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) was impatient to see Belinda; and, full of generous and grateful sentiments, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) first moment of joy, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) determined to conceal nothing from her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>); to make at once the confession of his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) own imprudence and the eulogium of Clarence Hervey's generosity. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) was just setting out for Twickenham, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) was sent for by his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) uncle, Governor Montford, who had business to settle with him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>), relative to his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) West India estates. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) spent the remainder of the morning with his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) uncle; and there he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) received a charming letter from Belinda -- that letter which she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) had written and sent whilst Lady Delacour was reading Clarence Hervey's packet. It would have cured Vincent of jealousy, even if he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) had not, in the interim, seen Mr Hervey, and learnt from him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) the news of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) approaching marriage. Miss Portman, at the conclusion of her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) letter, informed him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) that Lady Delacour purposed being in Berkeley-square the next day; that they were to spend a week in town, on account of Mrs Margaret Delacour, who had promised her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) ladyship a visit; and to go to Twickenham would be a formidable journey to an infirm old lady, who seldom stirred out of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) house.

<p/>Whatever displeasure Lady Delacour felt towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) friend Belinda, on account of her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) coldness to Mr Hervey, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) steadiness to Mr Vincent, had by this time subsided. Angry people, who express their passion, as it has been justly said, always speak worse than they think. This was usually the case with her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) ladyship.

<p/>The morning after they arrived in town, she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) came into Belinda's room, with an air of more than usual sprightliness and satisfaction. <div class="bookquote">``Great new! -- Great news! -- Extraordinary news! -- But it is very imprudent to excite your expectations, my dear Belinda. Pray, did you hear a wonderful noise in the square a little while ago?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I thought I heard a great bustle; but Marriott appeased my curiosity, by saying that it was only a battle between two dogs.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is well if this battle between two dogs do not end in a duel between two men,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>said Lady Delacour.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This prospect of mischief seems to have put your ladyship in wonderfully good spirits,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Belinda, smiling.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But what do you think I have heard of Mr Vincent?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>continued Lady Delacour: `that Miss Annabella Luttridge is dying for love of him (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) -- or of his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) fortune. Knowing, as I do, the vanity of mankind, I suppose that your Mr Vincent, all perfect as he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) is, was flattered by the little coquette; and perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) condescends to repay her (<font color='blue'><b>Luttridge</b></font>) in the same coin. I take it for granted -- for I always fill up the gaps in a story my own way -- I take it for granted that Mr Vincent got into some entanglement with her (<font color='blue'><b>Luttridge</b></font>), and that this has been the cause of the quarrel with the aunt. That there has been a quarrel is certain, for your friend Juba told Marriott so. His (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) massa swore that he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) would never go to Mrs Luttridge's again; and this morning he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) took the decisive measure of sending to request that his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) dog might be returned. Juba went for his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) namesake. Miss Annabella Luttridge was the person who delivered up the dog; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Luttridge</b></font>) desired the black to tell his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) master, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Luttridge</b></font>) compliments, that Juba's collar was rather too tight; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Luttridge</b></font>) begged that he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) would not fail to take it off as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) could. Perhaps, my dear, you are as simple as the poor negro, and suspect no finesse in this message. Miss Luttridge, aware that the faithful fellow was too much in your interests to be either persuaded or bribed to carry a billet-doux from any other lady to his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) master, did not dare to trust him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) upon this occasion; but she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had the art to make him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) carry her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) letter without his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) knowing it. Colin maillard, vulgarly called blind man's buff, was, some time ago, a favourite play amongst the Parisian ladies: now hide and seek will be brought into fashion, I suppose, by the fair Annabella. Judge of her (<font color='blue'><b>Annabella</b></font>) talents for the game by this instance: -- she (<font color='blue'><b>Annabella</b></font>) hid her (<font color='blue'><b>Annabella</b></font>) billet-doux within the lining of Juba's collar. The dog, unconscious of his (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) dignity as an ambassador, or rather as a charge d'affaires, set out on his (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) way home. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) was crossing Berkeley-square he (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) was met by Sir Philip Baddely and his (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) dog. The baronet's insolent favourite bit the black's heels. Juba, the dog, resented the injury immediately, and a furious combat ensued. In the height of the battle Juba's collar fell off. Sir Philip Baddely espied the paper that was sewed to the lining, and seized upon it immediately: the negro caught of it at the same instant: the baronet swore; the black struggled: the baronet knocked him (<font color='blue'><b>negro</b></font>) down. The great dog left his (<font color='blue'><b>negro</b></font>) canine antagonist that moment, flew at your baronet, and would have eaten him (<font color='blue'><b>negro</b></font>) up at three mouthfuls, if Sir Philip had not made good his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) retreat to Dangerfields's circulating library. The negro's head was terribly cut by the sharp point of a stone, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) ankle was sprained; but, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) just told me, he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) did not feel this till afterward. He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) started up, and pursued his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) master's enemy. Sir Philip was actually reading Miss Luttridge's billet-doux aloud when the black entered the library. He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) reclaimed his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) master's property with great intrepidity; and a gentleman who was present took his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) part immediately.

<p/>``In the mean time, Lord Delacour, who had been looking at the battle from our breakfast-room window, determined to go over to Dangerfield's, to see what was the matter, and how all this would end. He (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) entered the library just as the gentleman who had volunteered in favour of poor Juba was disputing with Sir Philip. The bleeding negro told my lord, in as plain words as he (<font color='blue'><b>negro</b></font>) could, the cause of the dispute; and Lord Delacour, who, to do him (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) justice, is a man of honour, joined instantly in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) defence. The baronet thought proper at length to submit; and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) left the field of battle, without having any thing to say for himself but -- <div class="bookquote">``Damme! -- very extraordinary, damme!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>-- or words to that effect.

<p/>``Now, Lord Delacour, besides being a man of honour, is also a man of humanity. I know that I cannot oblige you more, my dear Belinda, than by seasoning my discourse with a little conjugal flattery. My lord was concerned to see the poor black writhing in pain; and with the assistance of the gentleman who had joined in his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) defence, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) brought Juba across the square to our house. Guess for what: -- to try upon the strained ankle an infallible quack balsam recommended to him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) by the Dowager Lady Boucher. I was in the hall when they brought the poor fellow in: Marriott was called. ``Mrs Marriott,'' cried my lord, ``pray let us have Lady Boucher's infallible balsam -- this instant!'' Had you but seen the eagerness of face, or heard the emphasis, with which he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) said ``infallible balsam<div class="bookquote">'' -- you must let me laugh at the recollection. One human smile must pass, and be forgiven.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The smile may be the more readily forgiven,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Belinda, `since I am sure you are conscious that it reflected almost as much upon yourself as upon Lord Delacour.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, yes; belief in a quack doctor is full as bad as belief in a quack balsam, I allow. Your observation is so malicious, because so just, that to punish you for it, I will not tell you the remainder of my story for a week to come; and I assure you that the best part of it I have left untold. To return to our friend Mr Vincent: -- could you but know what reasons I have, at this instant, for wishing him (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) in Jamaica, you would acknowledge that I am truly candid in confessing that I believe my suspicious about E O were unfounded; and I am truly generous in admitting that you are right to treat him (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) with justice.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div><p/>This last enigmatical sentence Belinda could not prevail upon Lady Delacour to explain.

<p/>In the evening Mr Vincent made his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) appearance. Lady Delacour immediately attacked him (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) with raillery, on the subject of the fair Annabella. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) was rejoiced to perceive that her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) suspicions took this turn, and that nothing relative to the transaction in which Clarence Hervey had been engaged had transpired. Vincent wavered in his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) resolution to confess the truth to Belinda. Though he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) had determined upon this in the first moment of joyful enthusiasm, yet the delay of four-and-twenty hours had made a material change in his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) feelings; his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) most virtuous resolves were always rather the effect of sudden impulse than of steady principle. But when the tide of passion had swept away the landmarks, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) had no method of ascertaining the boundaries of right and wrong. Upon the present occasion his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) love for Belinda confounded all his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) moral calculations: one moment, his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) feelings as a man of honour forbade him (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) to condescend to the meanness of dissimulation; but the next instant his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) feelings as a lover prevailed; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) satisfied his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) conscience by the idea that, as his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) vow must preclude all danger of his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) return to the gaming-table in future, it would only be creating an unnecessary alarm in Belinda's mind to speak to her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) of his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) past imprudence. His (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) generosity at first revolted from the thought of suppressing those praises of Clarence Hervey, which had been so well deserved; but his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) jealousy returned, to combat his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) first virtuous impulse. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) considered that his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) own inferiority must by comparison appear more striking to his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) mistress; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) sophistically persuaded himself that it would be for her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) happiness to conceal the merits of a rival, to whom she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) could never be united. In this vacillating state of mind he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) continued during the greatest part of the evening. About half an hour before he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) leave, Lady Delacour was called out of the room by Mrs Marriott. Left alone with Belinda, his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) embarrassment increased, and the unsuspecting kindness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) manner was to him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) the most bitter reproach. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) stood in silent agony whilst in a playful tone she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) smiled and said,

<p/>``Where are your thoughts, Mr Vincent? If I were of a jealous temper, I should say with the fair Annabella -- '

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You would say wrong, then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr Vincent/Vincent</b></font>)</div>replied Mr Vincent, in a constrained voice. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) was upon the point of telling the truth; but to gain a reprieve of a few minutes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) entered into a defence of his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) conduct towards Miss Luttridge.

<p/>The sudden return of Lady Delacour relieved him (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) from his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) embarrassment, and they conversed only on general subjects during the remainder of the evening; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) as last departed, secretly rejoicing that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) was, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) fancied, under the necessity of postponing his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) explanation; he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) even thought of suppressing the history of his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) transaction with Mrs Luttridge. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) knew that his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) secret was safe with Clarence Hervey: Mrs Luttridge would be silent for her (<font color='blue'><b>Luttridge</b></font>) own sake; and neither Lady Delacour nor Belinda had any connexion with her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) society.

<p/>A few days afterward, Mr Vincent went to Gray, the jeweller, for some trinkets which he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) had bespoken. Lord Delacour was there, speaking about the diamond ring, which Gray had promised to dispose of for him (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>). Whilst his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) lordship and Mr Vincent were busy about their own affairs, Sir Philip Baddely and Mr Rochfort came into the shop. Sir Philip and Mr Vincent had never before met. Lord Delacour, to prevent him (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) from getting into a quarrel about a lady who was so little worth fighting for as Miss Annabella Luttridge, had positively refused to tell Mr Vincent what he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) knew of the affair, or to let him (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) know the name of the gentleman who was concerned in it.

<p/>The shopman addressed Mr Vincent by his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) name, and immediately Sir Philip whispered to Rochfort, that Mr Vincent was `the master of the black. ' Vincent, who unluckily overheard him (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>), instantly asked Lord Delacour if that was the gentleman who had behaved so ill to his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) servant? Lord Delacour told him (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) that it was now of no consequence to inquire. <div class="bookquote">``If,''  (<font color='red'><b>lordship</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) lordship, `either of these gentlemen choose to accost you, I shall think you do rightly to retort; but for Heaven's sake do not begin the attack!''

<p/>Vincent's impetuosity was not to be restrained; he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) demanded from Sir Philip whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) was the person who had beaten his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) servant? Sir Philip readily obliged him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) with an answer in the affirmative; and the consequence was the loss of a finger to the baronet, and a wound in the side to Mr Vincent, which, though it did not endanger his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) life, yet confined him (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) room for several days. The impatience of his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) mind increased his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) fever, and retarded his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) recovery.

<p/>When Belinda's first alarm for Mr Vincent's safety was over, she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) anxiously questioned Lord Delacour as to the particulars of all that had passed between Mr Vincent and Sir Philip, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) might judge of the manner in which her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) lover had conducted himself. Lord Delacour, who was a man of strict truth, was compelled to confess that Mr Vincent had shown more spirit than temper, and more courage than prudence. Lady Delacour rejoiced to perceive that this account made Belinda uncommonly serious.

<p/>Mr Vincent now thought himself sufficiently recovered to leave his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) room; his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) physicians, indeed, would have kept him (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) prisoner a few days longer, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) was too impatient of restraint to listen to their counsels.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Juba, tell the doctor, when he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) comes, that you could not keep me at home; and that is all that is necessary to be said.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) had now summoned courage to acknowledge to Belinda all that had happened, and was proceeding, with difficulty, down stairs, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) was suddenly struck by the sound of a voice which he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) little expected at this moment; a voice he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) had formerly been accustomed to hear with pleasure, but now it smote him (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) to the heart: -- it was the voice of Mr Percival. For the first time in his (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) life, he (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) wished to deny himself of his (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) friend. The recollection of the E O table, of Mrs Luttridge, of Mr Percival as his (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) guardian, and of all the advice he (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) had heard from him (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) as his (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) friend, rushed upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) mind at this instant; conscious and ashamed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) shrunk back, precipitately returned to his (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) own room, and threw himself into a chair, breathless with agitation. He (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) listened, expecting to hear Mr Percival coming up stairs, and endeavoured to compose himself, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) might not betray, by his (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) own agitation, all that he (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) wished most anxiously to conceal. After waiting for some time, he (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) rang the bell, to make inquiries. The waiter told him (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) that a Mr Percival had asked for him (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>); but, having been told by his (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) black that he (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) was just gone out, the gentleman being, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) said, much hurried, had left a note; for an answer to which he (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) would call at eight o'clock in the evening. Vincent was glad of this short reprieve. <div class="bookquote">``Alas!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>), `how changed am I, when I fear to meet my best friend! To what has this one fatal propensity reduced me!''

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) was little aware of the new difficulties that awaited him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>).

<p/>Mr. Percival's note was as follows: --

<p/>``My dear friend!
``Am not I a happy man, to find a friend in my ci-devant ward? But I have no time for sentiment; nor does it become the character, in which I am now writing to you -- that of a DUN. You are so rich, and so prudent, that the word in capital letters cannot frighten you. Lady Anne's cousin, poor Mr Carysfort, is dead. I am guardian to his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr</b></font>) boys; they are but ill provided for. I have fortunately obtained a partnership in a good house for the second son. Ten thousand pounds are wanting to establish him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) -- we cannot raise the money amongst us, without dunning poor Mr Vincent. Enclosed is your bond for the purchase-money of the little estate you brought from me last summer. I know that you have double the sum we want in ready money -- so I make no ceremony. Let me have the ten thousand this evening, if you can, as I wish to leave town as soon as possible.

<p/>``Yours most sincerely,
<div class="bookquote">``HENRY PERCIVAL.''


 (<font color='red'><b>Mr Vincent/Vincent</b></font>)</div><p/>Now Mr Vincent had lost, and had actually paid to Mrs Luttridge, the ready money which had been destined to discharge his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) debt to Mr Percival; he (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) expected fresh remittances from the West Indies in the course of a few weeks; but, in the mean time, he (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) must raise this money immediately: this he (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) could only do by having recourse to Jews -- a desperate expedient. The Jew, to whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) applied, no sooner discovered that Mr Vincent was under a necessity of having this sum before eight o'clock in the evening than he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) became exorbitant in his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) demands; and the more impatient this unfortunate young man became, the more difficulties he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) raised. At last, a bargain was concluded between them, in which Vincent knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) was grossly imposed upon; but to this he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) submitted, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) had no alternative. The Jew promised to bring him (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) ten thousand pounds at five o'clock in the evening, but it was half after seven before he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) made his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) appearance; and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) was so dilatory and circumspect, in reading over and signing the bonds, and in completing the formalities of the transaction, that before the money was actually in Vincent's possession, one of the waiters of the hotel knocked at the door to let him (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) know that Mr Percival was coming up stairs. Vincent hurried the Jew into an adjoining apartment, and bid him (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) wait there, till he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) should come to finish the business. Though totally unsuspicious, Mr Percival could not help being struck with the perturbation in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) found his (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) young friend. Vince immediately began to talk of the duel, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Vince</b></font>) friend was led to conclude that his (<font color='blue'><b>Vince</b></font>) anxiety arose from this affair. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vince</b></font>) endeavoured to put him (<font color='blue'><b>Vince</b></font>) at ease by changing the conversation. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vince</b></font>) spoke of the business which brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Vince</b></font>) to town, and of the young man whom he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was going to place with a banker.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), observing that Vincent grew more embarrassed, `that my dunning you for this money is not really inconvenient.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not in the least -- not in the least. I have the money ready -- in a few moments -- if you'll be so good as to wait here -- I have the money ready in the next room.''

 (<font color='red'><b>people</b></font>)</div><p/>At this instant a loud noise was heard -- the raised voices of two people quarrelling. It was Juba, the black, and Solomon, the Jew. Mr Vincent had sent Juba out of the way, on some errand, whilst he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) had been transacting his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) affairs with the Jew; but the black, having executed the commission on which he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) had been sent, returned, and went into his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) master's bedchamber, to read at his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) leisure a letter which he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) had just received from his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) wife. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) did not at first see the Jew, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) was spelling out the words of his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) wife's letter.

<p/>``My dear Juba,

<p/>``I take this op-por-tun -- '

<p/>-- nity he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) would have said; but the Jew, who had held his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) breath in to avoid discovery, till he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) could hold it no longer, now drew it so loud, that Juba started, looked round, and saw the feet of a man, which appeared beneath the bottom of the window curtain. Where fears of the supernatural appearances were out of the question, our negro was a man of courage; he (<font color='blue'><b>negro</b></font>) had no doubt that the man who was concealed behind the curtain was a robber, but the idea of a robber did not unnerve him (<font color='blue'><b>robber</b></font>) like that of an Obeah woman. With presence of mind worthy of a greater danger, Juba took down his (<font color='blue'><b>robber</b></font>) master's pistol, which hung over the chimney-piece, and marching deliberately up to the enemy, he (<font color='blue'><b>robber</b></font>) seized the Jew by the throat, exclaiming --

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You rob my massa? -- You dead man, if you rob my massa.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div><p/>Terrified at the sight of the pistol, the Jew instantly explained who he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) was, and producing his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) large purse, assured Juba that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) was come to lend money, and not to take it from his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) master; but this appeared highly improbable to Juba, who believed his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) master to be the richest man in the world; besides, the Jew's language was scarcely intelligible to him (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) saw secret terror in Solomon's countenance. Solomon had an antipathy to the sight of a black, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Solomon</b></font>) shrunk from the negro with strong signs of aversion. Juba would not relinquish his (<font color='blue'><b>Solomon</b></font>) hold; each went on talking in his (<font color='blue'><b>Solomon</b></font>) own angry gibberish as loud as he (<font color='blue'><b>Solomon</b></font>) could, till at last the negro fairly dragged the Jew into the presence of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) master and Mr Percival.

<p/>It is impossible to describe Mr Vincent's confusion, or Mr Percival's astonishment. The Jew's explanation was perfectly intelligible to him (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) saw at once all the truth. Vincent, overwhelmed with shame, stood the picture of despair, incapable of uttering a single syllable.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There is no necessity to borrow this money on my account,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr Percival</b></font>)</div>said Mr Percival, calmly: `and if there were, we could probably have it on more reasonable terms than this gentleman proposes.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I care not on what terms I have it -- I care not what becomes of me -- I am undone!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr Vincent/Vincent</b></font>)</div>cried Vincent.

<p/>Mr Percival cooly dismissed the Jew, made a sign to Juba to leave the room, and then, addressing himself to Vincent, said, <div class="bookquote">``I can borrow the money that I want elsewhere. Fear no reproaches from me -- I foresaw all this -- you have lost this sum at play: it is well that it was not your whole fortune. I have only one question to ask you, on which depends my esteem -- have you informed Miss Portman of this affair?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr Vincent/Vincent</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have not yet told her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>), but I was actually half down stairs in my way to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then, Mr Vincent, you are still my friend. I know the difficulty of such an avowal -- but it is necessary.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Cannot you, dear Mr Percival, save me the intolerable shame of confessing my own folly? Spare me this mortification! Be yourself the bearer of this intelligence, and the mediator in my favour.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will with pleasure,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr Percival</b></font>)</div>said Mr Percival; <div class="bookquote">``I will go this instant: but I cannot say that I have any hope of persuading Belinda to believe in your being irrevocably reclaimed from the charms of play.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr Percival</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed, my excellent friend, she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) may rely upon me: I feel such horror at the past, such heartfelt resolution against all future temptation, that you may pledge yourself for my total reformation.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr Percival</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr Percival promised that he (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) would exert all his (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) influence, except by pledging his (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) own honour; to this he (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) could not consent. <div class="bookquote">``If I have any good news for you, I will return as soon as possible; but I will not be the bearer of any painful intelligence,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>); and he (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) departed, leaving Mr Vincent in a state of anxiety, which, to his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) temper, was a punishment sufficient for almost any imprudence he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) could have committed.

<p/>Mr Percival returned no more that night. The next morning Mr Vincent received the following letter from Belinda. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) guessed his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) fate: he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) had scarcely power to read the words.


<p/>``I promised you that, whenever my own mind should be decided, I would not hold yours in suspense; yet at this moment I find it difficult to keep my word.
``Instead of lamenting, as you have often done, that my esteem for your many excellent qualities never rose beyond the bounds of friendship, we have now reason to rejoice at this, since it will save us much useless pain. It spares me the difficulty of conquering a passion that might be fatal to my happiness; and it will diminish the regret which you may feel at our separation. I am now obliged to say, that circumstances have made me certain we could not add to our mutual felicity by any nearer connexion.

<p/>``The hope of enjoying domestic happiness with a person whose manners, temper, and tastes suited my own, inclined me to listen to your addresses. But this happiness I could never enjoy with one who has any propensity to the love of play.

<p/>``For my own sake, as well as for yours, I rejoice that your fortune has not been materially injured; as this relieves me from the fear that my present conduct should be imputed to interested motives. Indeed, such is the generosity of your own temper, that in any situation I should scarcely have reason to apprehend from you such a suspicion.

<p/>``The absolute impossibility of my forming at present a connexion with another, will prevent you from imagining that I am secretly influenced by sentiments different from those which I avow; nor can any weak doubts on this subject expose me to my own reproaches.

<p/>``You perceive, sir, that I am not willing utterly to lose your esteem, even when I renounce, in the most unequivocal manner, all claim upon your affections. If any thing should appear to you harsh in this letter, I beg you to impute it to the real cause -- my desire to spare you all painful suspense, by convincing you at once that my determination is irrevocable. With sincere wishes for your happiness, I bid you farewell.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``BELINDA PORTMAN.''


 (<font color='red'><b>Mr Vincent/Vincent</b></font>)</div><p/>A few hours after Mr Vincent had read this letter he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) threw himself into a post-chaise, and set out for Germany. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) saw that all hopes of being united to Belinda were over, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) hurried as far from her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) as possible. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) letter rather soothed than irritated his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) temper; her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) praises of his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) generosity were highly gratifying, and they had so powerful an effect upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) mind, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) was determined to prove that they were deserved. His (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) conscience reproached him (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) with not having made sufficiently honourable mention of Clarence Hervey's conduct, on the night when he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) was on the point of destroying himself. Before he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) left London he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) wrote a full account of this whole transaction, to be given to Miss Portman after his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) departure.

<p/>Belinda was deeply touched by this proof of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) generosity. His (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) letter -- his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) farewell letter -- she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) could not read without great emotion. It was written with true feeling, but in a manly style, without one word of vain lamentation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What a pity,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>thought Belinda, `that with so many good and great qualities, I should be forced to bid him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) adieu for ever!''

<p/>Though she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) strongly felt the pain of this separation, yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) could not recede from her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) decision: nothing could tempt her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) to connect herself with a man who had the fatal taste for play. Even Mr Percival, much as he (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) loved his (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) ward, much as he (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) wished for his (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) union with Belinda, dared not pledge his (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) honour for Mr Vincent on this point.

<p/>Lady Anne Percival, in a very kind and sensible letter, expressed the highest approbation of Belinda's conduct; and the most sincere hope that Belinda would still continue to think of her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) with affection and esteem, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) had been so rash in her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) advice, and though her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) friendship had been apparently so selfish.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``DO not expect that I should pretend to be sorry for Mr Vincent,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>said Lady Delacour. ``Let him (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) be as generous and as penitent as he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) pleases, I am heartily glad that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) is on his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) way to Germany. I dare say he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) will find in the upper or lower circles of the empire some heroine in the Kotzebue taste, who will alternately make him (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) miserable till he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) is happy, and happy till he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) is miserable. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) is one of those men who require great emotions: fine lovers these make for stage effect -- but the worst husbands in the world!

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope, Belinda, you give me credit, for having judged better of Mr Vincent than Lady Anne Percival did?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``For having judged worse of him (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>), you mean? Lady Anne always judges as well as possible of every body.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will allow you to play upon words in a friend's defence, but do not be alarmed for the reputation of Lady Anne's judgment. If it will be any satisfaction to you, I can with thorough sincerity assure you that I never liked her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) so well in my life as since I have detected her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) in a mistake. It saves her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>), in my imagination, from the odium of being a perfect character.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And there was something so handsome in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) manner of writing to me, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) found out her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) error,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Belinda.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very true, and my friend Mr Percival behaved handsomely. Where friendships clash, it is not every man who has clearness of head sufficient to know his (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) duty to his (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) neighbour. Mr Percival said no more than just the thing he (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) ought, for his (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) ward. You have reason to be obliged to him (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>): and as we are returning thanks to all persons concerned in our deliverance from this imminent danger, Juba, the dog, and Juba, the black, and Solomon, the Jew, ought to come in for their share; for without that wrestling match of theirs, the truth might never have been dragged to light, and Mr Vincent would have been in due course of time your lord and master. But the danger is over; you need not look so terrified; do not be like the man who dropped down dead with terror, when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was shown by daylight the broken bridge which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had galloped over in the dark.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div><p/>Lady Delacour was in such high spirits that, without regard to connexion , she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) ran on from one subject to another.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You have proved to me, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>), `that you are not a girl to marry, because the day was fixed, or because things had gone so far. I give you infinite credit for your civil courage, as Dr X-- calls it: military courage, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) said to me yesterday -- military courage, that seeks the bubble reputation even in the cannon's mouth, may be had for sixpence a day. But civil courage, such as enabled the Princess Parizade, in the Arabian Tales, to go straight up the hill to her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) object, though the magical multitude of advising and abusive voices continually called to her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) to turn back, is one of the rarest qualities in man or woman, and not to be had for love, money, or admiration.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You place admiration not only above money, but above love, in your climax, I perceive,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Belinda, smiling.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I will give you leave to be as philosophically sarcastic as you please, my dear, if you will only smile, and if you will not look as pale as Seneca's Paulina, whose story we heard -- from whom?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``From Mr Hervey, I believe.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``His (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) name was ready upon your lips; I hope he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) was not far from your thoughts?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No one could be farther from my thoughts,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Belinda.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, very likely -- I believe it, because you say it; and because it is impossible.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Rally me as much as you please, my dear Lady Delacour, I assure you that I speak the simple truth.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I cannot suspect you of affectation, my dear. Therefore honestly tell me, if Clarence Hervey were at your feet this instant, would you spurn him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) from you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Spurn him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>)! no -- I would neither spurn him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>), nor motion him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) from me; but without using any of the terms in the heroine's dictionary -- '

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You would refuse him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>interrupted Lady Delacour, with a look of indignation -- `you would refuse him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I did not say so, I believe.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You would accept him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I did not say so, I am sure.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, you would tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) that you were not accustomed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not exactly in those words, perhaps.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, we shall not quarrel about words,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>said Lady Delacour; <div class="bookquote">``I only beg you to remember you own principles; and if ever you are put to the trial, be consistent. The first thing in a philosopher is to be consistent.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Fortunately, for the credit of my philosophy, there is no immediate danger of its being put to the test.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Unfortunately, you surely mean; unless you are afraid that it might not stand the test. But I was going, when I spoke of consistency, to remind you that all your own and Mr Percival's arguments about first loves may now, with equal propriety, be turned against you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How against me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They are evidently as applicable to second as to first loves, I think.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps they are,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Belinda; `but I really and truly am not inclined to think of love at present; particularly as there is no necessity that I should.''

<p/>Belinda took up a book, and Lady Delacour for one half hour abstained from any farther raillery. But longer than half an hour she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) could not be silent on the subject uppermost in her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) thoughts.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If Clarence Hervey,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>cried she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>), `were not the most honorable of blockheads, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) might be the most happy of men. This Virginia! -- oh, how I hate her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>)! -- I am sure poor Clarence cannot love her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>).''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Because you hate her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) -- or because you hate her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) without having ever seen her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Belinda.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I know what she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) must be,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>replied Lady Delacour: 'a soft, sighing, dying damsel, who puts bullfinches into her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) bosom. Smile, smile, my dear: you cannot help it; in spite of all your generosity, I know you must think as I do, and wish as I do, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) were at the bottom of the Black Sea this instant.''

<p/>Lady Delacour stood for some minutes musing, and then exclaimed, <div class="bookquote">``I will move heaven and earth to break off this absurd match.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good Heavens! my dear Lady Delacour, what do you mean?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mean! my dear -- I mean what I say, which very few people do: no wonder I should surprise you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I conjure you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>cried Belinda, `if you have the least regard for my honour and happiness -- '

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have not the least, but the greatest; and depend upon it, my dear, I will do nothing that shall injure that dignity of mind and delicacy of character, which I admire and love, as much as Clarence Hervey did, and does. Trust to me: not Lady Anne Percival herself can be more delicate in her (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) notions of propriety than I am for my friends, and since my reformation, I hope I may add, for myself. Fear nothing.''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>As she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) finished these words, she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) rang for her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) carriage. <div class="bookquote">``I don't ask you to go out with me, my dear Belinda; I give you leave to sit in this armchair till I come back again, with your feet upon the fender, a book in your hand, and this little table beside you, like Lady S's picture of Comfort.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div><p/>Lady Delacour spent the rest of the morning abroad; and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) returned home, she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) gave no account of what she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) had been doing, or of what or whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) had seen. This was so unusual, that Belinda could not avoid taking notice of it. Notwithstanding her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) ladyship's eulogium upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) own delicate sense of propriety, Miss Portman could not confide, with perfect resignation, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) prudence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your ladyship reproached me once,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>), in a playful tone, `for my provoking want of curiosity: you have completely cured me of this defect, for never was woman more curious than I am, at this instant, to know the secret scheme that you have in agitation.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have patience a little longer, and the mystery will be unravelled. In the mean time, trust that everything I do is for the best. However, as you have behaved pretty well, I will give you one leading hint, when you have explained to me what you meant by saying that your heart is not at present inclined to love. Pray, have you quarrelled with love for ever?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; but I can exist without it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you a heart?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``And it can exist without love? I now understand what was once said to me by a foolish lordling -- <div class="bookquote">``Of what use is the sun to the dial 10 ?'' (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>'

<p/>Company came in, and relieved Belinda from any further raillery. Lady Boucher and Mrs Margaret Delacour were, amongst a large party to dine at Lady Delacour's. At dinner, the dowager seized the first auspicious moment of silence to announce a piece of intelligence, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) flattered herself would fix the eyes of all the world upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So Mr Clarence Hervey is married at last!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Married! cried Lady Delacour: she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) had sufficient presence of mind not to look directly at Belinda; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) fixed the dowager's eyes, by repeating. <div class="bookquote">``Married! Are you sure of it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Positive -- positive! He (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) was privately married yesterday at his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) aunt, Lady Almeria's apartments, at Windsor, to Miss Hartley. I told you it was to be, and now it is over; and a very extraordinary match Mr Hervey has made of it, after all. Think of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) going at last, and marrying a girl who has been his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) mistress for years! Nobody will visit her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>), to be sure. Lady Almeria is excessively distressed; she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) did all she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) could to prevail on her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) brother, the bishop, to marry his (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) nephew, but he (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) very properly refused, giving it as a reason, that the girl's character was too well known.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought the bishop was at Spa,''  (<font color='red'><b>a gentleman</b></font>)</div>interposed a gentleman, whilst the dowager drew breath.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``O dear, no, sir; you have been misinformed,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>resumed she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``The bishop has been returned from Spa this great while, and he (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) has refused to see his (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) nephew, to my certain knowledge. After all, I cannot but pity poor Clarence for being driven into this match. Mr Hartley has a prodigious fine fortune, to be sure, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Hartley</b></font>) hurried things forward at an amazing rate, to patch up his (<font color='blue'><b>Hartley</b></font>) daughter's reputation. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hartley</b></font>) said, as I am credibly informed, yesterday morning, that if Clarence did not marry the girl before night, he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) would carry her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) fortune off the next day to the West Indies. Now the fortune was certainly an object!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear Lady Boucher,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Delacour</b></font>)</div>interrupted Lord Delacour, `you must be minsinformed in that particular: fortune is no object to Clarence Hervey; he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) is too generous a fellow to marry for fortune. What do you think -- what do you say, Lady Delacour?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I say, and think, and feel, as you do, my lord,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>said Lady Delacour.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You say, and think, and feel the same as my lord. -- Very extraordinary indeed!''  (<font color='red'><b>the dowager</b></font>)</div>said the dowager. <div class="bookquote">``Then if it were not for the sake of the fortune, pray why did Mr Hervey marry at all? Can any body guess?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should guess because he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) was in love,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Delacour</b></font>)</div>said Lord Delacour; `for I remember that was the reason I married myself.''

<p/>``My dear good lord -- but when I tell you the girl had been his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) mistress, till he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) was tired of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) -- '

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My Lady Boucher,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Delacour/Mrs Margaret Delacour/Margaret</b></font>)</div>said Mrs Margaret Delacour, who had hitherto listened in silence, `my Lady Boucher, you have been minsinformed; Miss Hartley never was Clarence Hervey's mistress.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm mighty glad you think so, Mrs Delacour; but I assure you nobody else is so charitable. Those who live in the world hear a great deal more than those who live out of the world. I can promise you, nobody will visit the bride, and that is the thing by which we are to judge.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the dowager rest</b></font>)</div><p/>Then the dowager and the rest of the company continued to descant upon the folly of the match. Those who wished to pay their court to Lady Delacour were the loudest in their astonishment at his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) throwing himself away in this manner. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) ladyship smiled, and kept them in play by her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) address, on purpose to withdraw all eyes from Miss Portman, whilst, from time to time, she (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) stole a glance at Belinda, to observe how she (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) was affected by what passed: she (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) was provoked by Belinda's self-possession. At last, when it had been settled that all the Herveys were odd, but that this match of Clarence's was the oddest of all the odd things that any of the family had done for many generations, Mrs Delacour calmly said, <div class="bookquote">``Are you sure, Lady Boucher, that Mr Hervey is married?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Delacour/Mrs Margaret Delacour/Margaret</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Positive! as I said before, positive! Madam, my woman had it from Lady Newland's Swiss, who had it from Lady Singleton's French-woman, who had it from Longueville, the hairdresser, who had it from Lady Almeria's own woman, who was present at the ceremony, and must know if any body does.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The report has come to us zigzag as quick as lightning, yet it does not flash conviction upon me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>said Lady Delacour.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nor upon me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Delacour/Mrs Margaret Delacour/Margaret</b></font>)</div>said Mrs Delacour, `for this simple reason. I have seen Miss Hartley within these two hours, and I had it from herself that she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) is not married.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not married!''  (<font color='red'><b>the dowager</b></font>)</div>cried the dowager with terror.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I rather think not; she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) is now with her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) father, at my house at dinner, I believe, and Clarence Herey is at Lady Almeria's at Windsor: her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) ladyship is confined by a fit of the gout, and sent for her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) nephew yesterday. If people who live out of the world hear less, they sometimes hear more correctly than those who live in it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pray when does Mr Hervey return from Windsor?''  (<font color='red'><b>the dowager</b></font>)</div>said the incorrigible dowager.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``To-morrow, madam,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Delacour/Mrs Margaret Delacour/Margaret</b></font>)</div>said Mrs Delacour. <div class="bookquote">``As your ladyship is going to several parties this evening, I think it but charitable to set you right in these particulars, and I hope you will be so charitable as to contradict the report of Miss Hartley's having been Clarence's mistress.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, as to that, if the young lady is not married, we must presume there are good reasons for it,''  (<font color='red'><b>the dowager</b></font>)</div>said the dowager. <div class="bookquote">``Pray, on which side was the match broken off?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``On neither side,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Delacour/Mrs Margaret Delacour/Margaret</b></font>)</div>answered Mrs Delacour.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The thing goes on then; and what day is the marriage to take place?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Boucher</b></font>)</div>said Lady Boucher.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``On Monday -- or Tuesday -- or Wednesday -- or Thursday -- or Friday -- or Saturday -- or Sunday, I believe,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Delacour/Mrs Margaret Delacour/Margaret</b></font>)</div>replied Mrs Delacour, who had the prudent art of giving answers effectually baffling to the curiosity of gossips.

<p/>The dowager consoled herself in her (<font color='blue'><b>Boucher</b></font>) utmost need with a full plate of brandy peaches, and spoke not a word more during the second course. When the ladies retired after the desert, she (<font color='blue'><b>Boucher</b></font>) again commenced hostilities: she (<font color='blue'><b>Boucher</b></font>) dared not come to open war with Mrs Delacour; but in a bye-battle, in a corner, she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) carried every thing before her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>); and she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) triumphantly whispered, <div class="bookquote">``We shall see, ma'am, that it will turn out, as I told you, that Miss Rachel, or Virginia, or whatever he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) pleases to call her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>), has been what I said; and, as I said, nobody will visit her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>), not a soul: fifty people I can count who have declared to me they've made up their minds; and my own's made up, I candidly confess; and Lady Delacour, I am sure by her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) silence and looks, is of my way of thinking, and has no opinion of the young lady: as to Miss Portman, she (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) is, poor thing, of course, so wrapped up in her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) own affairs, no wonder she (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) says nothing. That was a sad business of Mr Vincent's! I am surprised to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) look even so well as she (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) does after it. Mr Percival, I am told,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said the well-informed dowager, lowering her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) voice so much that the lovers of scandal were obliged to close their heads round her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) -- <div class="bookquote">``Mr Percival, I am informed, refused his (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) consent to his (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) ward -LRB-who is not of age-RRB- on account of an anonymous letter, and it is supposed Mr Vincent desired it for an excuse to get off handsomely. Fighting that duel about her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) with Sir Philip Baddely settled his (<font color='blue'><b>Baddely</b></font>) love -- so he (<font color='blue'><b>Baddely</b></font>) is gone to Germany, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) is left to wear the willow, which, you see, becomes her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) as well as everything else. Did she (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) eat any dinner, ma'am? You sat next her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>the lovers</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; more than I did, I am sure.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very extraordinary! Then perhaps Sir Philip Baddely's on again -- Lord bless me, what a match would that be for her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>)! Why, Mrs Stanhope might then, indeed, deserve to be called the match-maker general. The seventh of her (<font color='blue'><b>Stanhope</b></font>) nieces this. But look, there's Mrs Delacour leading Miss Portman off into the trictrac cabinet, with a face full of business -- her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) hand in hers -- Lord, I did not know they were on that footing! I wonder what's going forward. Suppose old Hartley was to propose for Miss Portman -- there would be a dénouement! And cut his (<font color='blue'><b>Hartley</b></font>) daughter off with a shilling! Nothing's impossible, you know. Did he (<font color='blue'><b>Hartley</b></font>) ever see Miss Portman! I must go and find out positively.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Delacour/Mrs Margaret Delacour/Margaret</b></font>)</div><p/>In the mean time, Mrs Delacour, unconscious of the curiosity she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) had excited, was speaking to Belinda in the trictrac cabinet.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear Miss Portman,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>), `you have a great deal of good-nature, else I should not venture to apply to you on the present occasion. Will you oblige me, and serve a friend of mine -- a gentleman who, as I once imagined, was an admirer of yours?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I will do any thing in my power to oblige any friend of yours, madam,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Belinda; `but of whom are you speaking?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of Mr Hervey, my dear young lady.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell me how I can serve him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) as a friend,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Belinda, colouring deeply.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That you shall know immediately,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Delacour/Mrs Margaret Delacour/Margaret</b></font>)</div>said Mrs Delacour, rummaging and rustling for a considerable time amoungst a heap of letters, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) had pulled out of the largest pockets that ever woman wore, even in the last century.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, here it is,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>continued she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), opening and looking into them. <div class="bookquote">``May I trouble you just to look over this letter? It is from poor Mr Hartley; he (<font color='blue'><b>Hartley</b></font>) is, as you will see, excessively fond of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hartley</b></font>) daughter, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Hartley</b></font>) has so fortunately discovered after his (<font color='blue'><b>Hartley</b></font>) long search: he (<font color='blue'><b>Hartley</b></font>) is dreadfully nervous, and has been terribly annoyed by these idle gossiping stories. You find, by what Lady Boucher said at dinner, that they have settled it amongst them that Virginia is not a fit person to be visited; that she (<font color='blue'><b>Boucher</b></font>) has been Clarence's mistresss instead of his (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) pupil. Mr Hartley, you see by this letter, is almost out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hartley</b></font>) senses with the apprehension that his (<font color='blue'><b>Hartley</b></font>) daughter's reputation is ruined. I sent my carriage to Twickenham, the moment I received this letter, for the poor girl and her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) gouvernante. They came to me this morning; but what can I do? I am only one old woman against a confederacy of veteran gossips; but if I could gain you and Lady Delacour for my allies, I should fear no adversaries. Virginia is to stay with me for some days; and Lady Delacour, I see, has a great mind to come to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>); but she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) does not like to come without you, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) says that she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) does not like to ask you to accompany her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>). I don't understand her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) delicacy about the matter -- I have none; believing, as I do, that there is no foundation whatever for these malicious reports, which, entre nous, originated, I fancy, with Mrs Marriott. Now, will you oblige me? If you and Lady Delacour will come and see Virginia to-morrow, all the world would follow your example the next day. It's often cowardice that makes people ill-natured: have you the courage, my good Miss Portman, to be the first to do a benevolent action? I do assure you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Delacour/Mrs Margaret Delacour/Margaret</b></font>)</div>continued Mrs Delacour with great earnestness, <div class="bookquote">``I do assure you I would as soon put my hand into that fire, this moment, as ask you to do any thing that I thought improper. But forgive me for pressing this point; I am anxious to have your suffrage in her (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) favour: Miss Belinda Portman's character for prudence and propriety stands so high, and is fixed so firmly, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) may venture to let us cling to it; and I am as well convinced of the poor girl's innocence as I am of yours; and when you see her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), you will be of my opinion.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Delacour/Mrs Margaret Delacour/Margaret</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I assure you, Mrs Delacour,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Belinda, `that you have wasted a great deal of eloquence upon this occasion, for -- '

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sorry for it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>interrupted Mrs Delacour, rising from her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) seat, with a look of some displeasure. <div class="bookquote">``I meant not to distress or offend you, Miss Portman, by my eloquence: I am only concerned that I should have so far mistaken your character as to expose myself to this refusal.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have given no refusal,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Belinda, mildly: `you did not let me finish my sentence.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I beg pardon; that is a foolish old trick of mine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mrs Delacour, I was going to say, has wasted a great deal of eloquence: for I am entirely of her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) opinion, and I shall, with the greatest readiness, comply with her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) request.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are a charming, generous girl, and I am a passionate old fool -- thank you a thousand times.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are not at all obliged to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Belinda. <div class="bookquote">``When I first heard this story, I believed it, as Lady Boucher now does -- but I have had reason to alter my opinion, and perhaps the same means of information would have changed hers; once convinced, it is impossible to relapse into suspicion.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Impossible to you: the most truly virtuous women are always the least suspicious and uncharitable in their opinion of their own sex. Lady Anne Percival inspired me with this belief, and Miss Portman confirms it. I admire your courage in daring to come forward in the defence of innocence. I am very rude, alas! for praising you so much.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have not a right to your admiration,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Belinda; `for I must honestly confess to you that I should not have this courage if there were any danger in the case. I do not think that in doubtful cases it is the business of a young woman to hazard her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) own reputation by an attempt to preserve another's: I do not imagine, at least, that I am of sufficient consequence in the world for this purpose; therefore I should never attempt it. It is the duty of such women as Mrs Delacour, whose reputation is beyond the power of scandal, to come forward in the defence of injured innocence; but this would not be courage in Belinda Portman, it would be presumption and temerity.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, if you will not let me admire your courage, or your generosity, or your prudence,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Delacour/Mrs Margaret Delacour/Margaret</b></font>)</div>said Mrs Delacour laughing, `you must postively let me admire you altogether, and love you too, for I cannot help it. Farewell.''

<p/>After the company was gone, Lady Delacour was much surprised by the earnestness with which Belinda pressed the request, that they might the next morning pay a visit to Virginia.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>said Lady Delacour, `to tell you the truth, I am full of curiosity, and excessively anxious to go. I hesitated merely on your account: I fancied that you would not like the visit, and that if I went without you, it might be taken notice of; but I am delighted to find that you will come with me: I can only say that you have more generosity than I should have in the same situation.''

<p/>The next morning they went together to Mrs Delacour's. In their way thither, Belinda, to divert her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) own thoughts, and to rouse Lady Delacour from the profound and unnatural silence into which she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) had fallen, petitioned her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) to finish the history of Sir Philip Baddely, the dog, Miss Annabella Luttridge, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Luttridge</b></font>) billet-doux.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``For some of my high crimes and misdemeanours, you vowed that you would not tell me the remainder of the story till the whole week had elapsed; now will you satisfy my curiosity? You recollect that you left off just where you said that you were come to the best part of the story.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Was I? did I? -- Very true, we shall have time enough to finish it by-and-by, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>said Lady Delacour; `at present my poor head is running upon something else, and I have left off being an accomplished actress, or I could talk of one subject and think of another as well as the best of you. -- Stop the carriage, my dear; I am afraid they have forgot my orders.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Did you carry what I desired this morning to Mrs Delacour?''  (<font color='red'><b>ladyship</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>actress</b></font>) ladyship to one of the footmen.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I did, my lady.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And did you say from me, that it was not to be opened till I came?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, my lady.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Where did you leave it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In Mrs Delacour's dressing-room, my lady: -- she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) desired me to take it up there, and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) locked the door, and said no one should go in till you came.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well -- go on. Belinda, my dear, I hope that I have worked up your curiosity to the highest pitch.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER XXXI

<p/>The Dénouement

<p/>CURIOSITY was not, at this instant, the strongest passion in Belinda's mind. When the carriage stopped at Mrs Delacour's door, her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) heart almost ceased to beat; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) summoned resolution to go through, with firmness and dignity, the task she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) had undertaken.

<p/>Clarence Hervey was not in the room when they entered, nor was Virginia: Mrs Ormond said that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) had been extremely feverish during the night, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) had advised her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) not to get up till late in the day. But Mrs Delacour immediately went for her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>), and in a few minutes she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) made her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) appearance.

<p/>Belinda and Lady Delacour exchanged a glance of surprise and admiration. There was a grace and simplicity in her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) manner, joined to an air of naïveté, that made an irresistible impression in her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) favour. Lady Delacour, however, after the first surprise was over, seemed to relapse into her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) former opinion; and the piercing looks which her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) ladyship from time to time cast upon Virginia as she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) spoke, produced their effect. She (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) was abashed and silent. Belinda endeavoured to engage her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) in conversation, and to her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) talked with ease and even with freedom. Virginia examined Miss Portman's countenance with a species of artless curiosity and interest, that was not restrained by factitious politeness. This examination was not peculiarly agreeable to Belinda, yet it was made with so much apparent simplicity, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) could not be displeased.

<p/>On the first pause in the conversation, Mrs Delacour said, <div class="bookquote">``Pray, my dear Lady Delacour, what is this wonderful present that you sent to me this morning, which you desired that no one should see till you came?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Delacour/Mrs Margaret Delacour/Margaret</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I cannot satisfy your curiosity yet,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>replied Lady Delacour. <div class="bookquote">``I must wait till Clarence Hervey comes, for the present is intended for him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>ladyship</b></font>)</div><p/>An air of solemn mystery in her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) ladyship's manner, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) pronounced these words, excited general attention. There was a dead silence, which lasted several minutes: some feeble attempts were then made by each of the company to start a fresh subject of conversation; but it would not do -- all relapsed into the silence of expectation. At last Clarence Hervey arrived. Belinda rejoiced that the universal curiosity which Lady Delacour had inspired prevented any one's observing the sudden change in Mr Hervey's countenance when he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) beheld her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A pretty set of curious children you are!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>cried Lady Delacour, laughing. ``Do you know, Clarence, that they are all dying with impatience to see un gage d'amitié that I have brought for you: and the reason that they are so curious is simply because I had the address to say, in a solemn voice, ``I cannot satisfy your curiosity till Clarence Hervey arrives.<div class="bookquote">'' Now follow me, my friends; and if you be disappointed, lay the blame, not on me, but on your own imagination.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) led the way to Mrs Delacour's dressing-room, and all the company followed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, what do you expect to see?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>), putting the key into the door.

<p/>After waiting some moments for a reply, but in vain, she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) threw open the door, and they saw, hung before the wall opposite to them, a green curtain.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought, my dear Clarence,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>resumed Lady Delacour, `that no present could be more agreeable to you than a companion for your Virginia. Does this figure,<div class="bookquote">'' continued she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>), drawing back the curtain, `does this figure give you the idea of Paul?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Paul!''  (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div>said Clarence; `it is a naval officer in full uniform: what can your ladyship mean?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Virginia perhaps will know what I mean, if you will only stand out of her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) way, and let her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) see the picture.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div><p/>At these words Clarence made way for Virginia: she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) eyes upon the picture, uttered a piercing shriek, and fell senseless upon the floor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Take it coolly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>said Lady Delacour, `and she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) will come to her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) senses presently. Young ladies must shriek and faint upon certain occasions; but men -LRB-looking at Clarence Hervey-RRB- need not always be dupes. This is only a scene; consider it as such, and admire the actress as I do.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Actress! Oh, she (<font color='blue'><b>Actress</b></font>) is no actress!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Ormond/Ormond</b></font>)</div>cried Mrs Ormond.

<p/>Clarence Hervey raised her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) from the ground, and Belinda sprinkled water over her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Actress</b></font>)'s dead! -- she (<font color='blue'><b>Actress</b></font>)'s dead! Oh, my sweet child! she (<font color='blue'><b>Actress</b></font>)'s dead!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Ormond/Ormond</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Mrs Ormond, trembling so violently, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) could not sustain Virginia.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Actress</b></font>) is no actress, indeed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div>said Clarence Hervey: `her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) pulse is gone!''

<p/>Lady Delacour looked at Virginia's pale lips, touched her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) cold hands, and with a look of horror cried out, <div class="bookquote">``Good Heavens! what have I done? What shall we do with her (<font color='blue'><b>Actress</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Give her (<font color='blue'><b>Actress</b></font>) air -- give her (<font color='blue'><b>Actress</b></font>) air, air, air!''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>cried Belinda.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You keep the air from her (<font color='blue'><b>Actress</b></font>), Mrs Ormond,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Delacour/Mrs Margaret Delacour/Margaret</b></font>)</div>said Mrs Delacour. <div class="bookquote">``Let us leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) to Miss Portman; she (<font color='blue'><b>Portman</b></font>) has more presence of mind than any of us.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And as she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) spoke she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) forced Mrs Ormond away with her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) out of the room.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If Mr Hartley should come, keep him (<font color='blue'><b>Hartley</b></font>) with you, Mrs Delacour,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div>said Clarence Hervey. <div class="bookquote">``Is her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) pulse quite gone?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; it beats stronger and stronger,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Belinda.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) colour is returning,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>said Lady Delacour. <div class="bookquote">``There! raise her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) a little, dear Belinda; she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) is coming to herself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Had not you better draw the curtain again before that picture,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Miss Portman, `lest she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) should see it the moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) opens her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) eyes?''

<p/>Virginia came slowly to her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) recollections, saw Lady Delacour drawing the curtain before the picture, then fixed her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) eyes upon Clarence Hervey, without uttering a word.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you better now?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>), in a gentle tone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, do not speak -- do not look so kindly!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>cried Virginia. ``I am well -- quite well -- better than I deserve to be;' and she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) pressed Belinda's hand, as if to thank her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) for assisting and supporting her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We may safely leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>whispered Belinda to Lady Delacour; `we are strangers, and our presence only distresses her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>).''

<p/>They withdrew. But the moment Virginia found herself alone with Mr Hervey, she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) was seized with a universal tremor; she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) tried to speak, but could not articulate. At last she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) burst into a flood of tears; and when this had in some measure relieved her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) threw herself upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) knees, and clasping her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) hands, exclaimed, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) looked up to heaven --

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, if I knew what I ought to do! -- if I knew what I ought to say!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Shall I tell you, Virginia? And will you believe me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, yes, yes!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You ought to say -- the truth, whatever it may be.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you will think me the most ungrateful of human beings?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How often must I assure you, Virginia, that I make no claim upon your gratitude? Speak to me -- I conjure you, as you value your happiness and mine -- speak to me without disguise! What is all this mystery? Why should you fear to let me know what passes in your heart? Why did you shriek at the sight of that picture?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, forgive me! forgive me!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>cried Virginia: she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) would have sunk at his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) feet, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) had not prevented her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I will -- I can forgive any thing but deceit. Do not look at me with so much terror, Virginia -- I have not deserved it: my wish is to make you happy. I would sacrifice even my own happiness to secure yours; but do not mislead me, or you ruin us both. Cannot you give me a distinct answer to this simple question -- Why did you shriek at the sight of that picture?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Because -- but you will call me <div class="bookquote">``perfidious, ungrateful Virginia!''  (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div>-- because I have seen that figure -- he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) has knelt to me -- he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) has kissed my hand -- and I -- '

<p/>Clarence Hervey withdrew his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) arms, which had supported her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>), and placing her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) upon a sofa, left her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>), whilst he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) walked up and down the room for some minutes in silence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And why, Virginia,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>), stopping short, `was it necessary to conceal all this from me? Why was it necessary to persuade me that I was beloved? Why was it necessary that my happiness should be the sacrifice?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It shall not! -- it shall not! Your happiness shall not be the sacrifice. Heaven is my witness, that there is no sacrifice I would not make for you. Forgive me that shriek! I could not help fainting, indeed! But I will be yours -- I ought to be yours; and I am not perfidious -- I am not ungrateful: do not look upon me as you did in my dream!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do not talk to me of dreams, my dear Virginia; this is no time for trifling; I ask no sacrifice from you -- I ask nothing but truth.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Truth! Mrs Ormond knows all the truth: I have concealed nothing from her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But she (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) has concealed every thing from me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div>cried Clarence; and, with a sudden impulse of indignation, he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) was going to summon her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>), but when his (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) hand was upon the lock of the door he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) paused, returned to Virginia, and said, <div class="bookquote">``Let me hear the truth from your lips: it is all I shall ever ask from you. How -- when -- where did you see this man?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What man?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Virginia, looking up, with the simple expression of innocence in her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) countenance.

<p/>Clarence pointed to the picture.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``At the village in the New Forest, at Mrs Smith's house,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said Virginia, `one evening when I walked with her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) from my grandmother's cottage.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And your grandmother knew of this?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said Virginia, blushing, `and she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) was very much displeased.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And Mrs Ormond knew of this?''  (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div>pursued Clarence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) told me that you would not be displeased at it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr Hervey made another hasty step toward the door, but restraining his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) impetuous temper, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) again stopped, and leaning over the back of a chair, opposite to Virginia, waited in silence for her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) to proceed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) waited in vain.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not mean to distress you, Miss Hartley,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>).

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) burst into tears. <div class="bookquote">``I knew, I knew,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>cried she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>), `that you would be displeased; I told Mrs Ormond so. I knew you would never forgive me.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``In that you were mistaken,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div>said Clarence, mildly; <div class="bookquote">``I forgive you without difficulty, as I hope you may forgive yourself: nor can it be my wish to extort from you any mortifying confessions. But, perhaps, it may yet be in my power to serve you, if you will trust to me. I will myself speak to your father. I will do every thing to secure to you the object of your affections, if you will, in this last moment of our connexion, treat me with sincerity, and suffer me to be your friend.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div><p/>Virginia sobbed so violently for some time, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>) could not speak: at last she (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>) said, ``You are -- you are the most generous of men! You have always been my best friend! I am the most ungrateful of human beings! But I am sure I never wished, I never intended, to deceive you. Mrs Ormond told me -- '

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do not speak of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) at present, or perhaps I may lose my temper,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div>interrupted Clarence in an altered voice: `only tell me -- I conjure you, tell me -- in one word, who is this man? and where is he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to be found?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not know. I do not understand you,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Virginia.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You do not know! You will not trust me. Then I must leave you to -- to Mr Hartley.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do not leave me -- oh, do not leave me in anger!''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>cried Virginia, clinging to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Not trust you! -- I! -- not trust you! Oh, what can you mean? I have no confessions to make! Mrs Ormond knows every thought of my mind, and so shall you, if you will only hear me. I do not know who this man is, I assure you; nor where he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is to be found.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And yet you love him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)? Can you love a man whom you do not know, Virginia?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I only love his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) figure, I believe,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Virginia.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) figure?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed I am quite bewildered,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Virginia, looking round wildly; <div class="bookquote">``I know not what I feel.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you permitted this man to kneel to you, to kiss your hand, surely you must know that you love him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), Virginia?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``But that was only in a dream; and Mrs Ormond said -- '

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Only a dream! But you met him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) at Mrs Smith's, in the New Forest?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That was only a picture.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Only a picture! -- but you have seen the original?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Never -- never in my life; and I wish to Heaven I had never, never seen the fatal picture! the image haunts me day and night. When I read of heroes in the day, that figure rises to my view, instead of yours. When I go to sleep at night, I see it, instead of yours, in my dreams; it speaks to me, it kneels to me. I long ago told Mrs Ormond this, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) laughed at me. I told her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) of that frightful dream. I saw you weltering in your blood; I tried to save you, but could not. I heard you say, ``Perfidious, ungrateful Virginia! you are the cause of my death!<div class="bookquote">'' Oh, it was the most dreadful night I ever passed! Still this figure, this picture, was before me; and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was the knight of the white plumes; and it was he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) who stabbed you; but when I wished him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to be victorious, I did not know that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was fighting against you. So Mrs Ormond told me that I need not blame myself and she (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) said that you were not so foolish as to be jealous of a picture; but I knew you would he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) displeased -- I knew you would think me ungrateful -- I knew you would never forgive me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div><p/>Whilst Virginia rapidly uttered all this, Clarence marked the wild animation of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) eyes, the sudden changes of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) countenance; he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) recollected her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) father's insanity; every feeling of his (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) mind gave way to terror and pity; he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) approached her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) with all the calmness that he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) could assume, took both her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) hands, and holding them in his (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>), said, in a soothing voice --

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear Virginia you are not ungrateful. I do not think you so. I am not displeased with you. You have done nothing to displease me. Compose yourself, dear Virginia.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am quite composed, now you again call me dear Virginia. Only I am afraid, as I always told Mrs Ormond, that I do not love you enough; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) said that I did, and that my fear was the strongest proof of my affection.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div><p/>Virginia now spoke in so consistent a manner that Clarence could not doubt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) was in the clear possession of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) understanding. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) repeated to him (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) all that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) had said to Mrs Ormond; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) began to hope that, without any intention to deceive, Mrs Ormond's ignorance of the human heart led her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) into a belief that Virginia was in love with him (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>); whilst, in fact, her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) imagination, exalted by solitude and romance, embodied and became enamoured of a phantom.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I always told Mrs Ormond that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) was mistaken,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div>said Clarence. <div class="bookquote">``I never believed that you loved me, Virginia, till -- -LRB-he (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) paused and carefully examined her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) countenance-RRB- -- till you yourself gave me reason to think so. Was it only a principle of gratitude, then, that dictated your answer to my letter?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) looked irresolute: and at last, in a low voice, said, ``If I could see, if I could speak to Mrs Ormond -- '

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>) cannot tell what are the secret feelings of your heart, Virginia. Consult no Mrs Ormond. Consult no human creature but yourself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But Mrs Ormond told me that you loved me, and that you had educated me to be your wife.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr Hervey made an involuntary exclamation against Mrs Ormond's folly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How, then, can you be happy,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>continued Virginia, `if I am so ungrateful as to say I do not love you? That I do not love you! -- Oh! that I cannot say; for I do love you better than any one living except my father, and with the same sort of affection that I feel for him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). You ask me to tell you the secret feelings of my heart: the only secret feeling of which I am conscious is -- a wish not to marry, unless I could see in reality such a person as -- But that I knew was only a picture, a dream; and I thought that I ought at least to sacrifice my foolish imagination to you, who have done so much for me. I knew that it would be the height of ingratitude to refuse you; and besides, my father told me that you would not accept of my fortune without my hand, so I consented to marry you: forgive me, if these were wrong motives -- I thought them right. Only tell me what I can do to make you happy, as I am sure I wish to do; to that wish I would sacrifice every other feeling.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sacrifice nothing, dear Virginia. We may both be happy without making any sacrifice of our feelings,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div>cried Clarence. And, transported at regaining his (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) own freedom, Virginia's simplicity never appeared to him (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) so charming as at this moment. <div class="bookquote">``Dearest Virginia, forgive me for suspecting you for one instant of any thing unhandsome. Mrs Ormond, with the very best intentions possible, has led us both to the brink of misery. But I find you such as I always thought you, ingenuous, affectionate, innocent.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you are not angry with me?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>interrupted Virginia, with joyful eagerness; `and you will not think me ungrateful? And you will not be unhappy? And Mrs Ormond was mistaken? And do you not wish that I should love you, that I should be your wife, I mean? Oh, don't deceive me, for I cannot help believing whatever you say.

<p/>Clarence Hervey, to give her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) a convincing proof that Mrs Ormond had misled her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) as to his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) sentiments, immediately avowed his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) passion for Belinda.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You have relieved me from all doubt, all fear, all anxiety,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Virginia, with the sweetest expression of innocent affection in her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) countenance. ``May you be as happy as you deserve to be! May Belinda -- is not that her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) name? -- May Belinda -- '

<p/>At this moment Lady Delacour half opened the door, exclaiming --

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Human patience can wait no longer!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Will you trust me to explain for you, dear Virginia?''  (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div>said Clarence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Most willingly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>said Virginia, retiring as Lady Delacour advanced. <div class="bookquote">``Pray leave me here alone, whilst you, who are used to talk before strangers, speak for me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dare you venture, Clarence,''  (<font color='red'><b>ladyship</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) ladyship, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) closed the door, `to leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) alone with that picture? You are no lover, if you be not jealous.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not jealous,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div>said Clarence, `yet I am a lover -- a passionate lover.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A passionate lover!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>cried Lady Delacour, stopping short as they were crossing the antechamber: -- `then I have done nothing but mischief. In love with Virginia? I will not -- cannot believe it.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``In love with Belinda! -- Cannot you, will not you believe it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear Clarence, I never doubted it for an instant. But are you at liberty to own it to any body but me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am at liberty to declare it to all the world.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You transport me with joy! I will not keep you from her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) a second. But stay -- I am sorry to tell you, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) informed me this morning, her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) heart is not at present inclined to love. And here is Mrs Margaret Delacour, poor wretch, in this room, dying with curiosity. Curiosity is as ardent as love, and has as good a claim to compassion.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) entered the room, where there were only Mrs Margaret Delacour and Belinda, Clarence Hervey's first glance, rapid as it was, explained his (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) heart.

<p/>Belinda put her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) arm within Lady Delacour's, trembling so that she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) could scarcely stand. Lady Delacour pressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) hand, and was perfectly silent.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And what is Miss Portman to believe,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Delacour/Mrs Margaret Delacour/Margaret</b></font>)</div>cried Mrs Margaret Delacour, `when she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) has seen you on the very eve of marriage with another lady?''

<p/>``The strongest merit I can plead with such a woman as Miss Portman is, that I was ready to sacrifice my own happiness to a sense of duty. Now that I am at liberty -- '

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now that you are at liberty,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>interrupted Lady Delacour, `you are in a vast hurry to offer your whole soul to a lady, who has for months seen all your merits with perfect insensibility, and who has been, notwithstanding all my operations, stone blind to your love.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The struggles of my passion cannot totally have escaped Belinda's penetration,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div>said Clarence; `but I like her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) a thousand times the better for not having trusted merely to appearances. That love is most to be valued which cannot be easily won. In my opinion there is a prodigious difference between a warm imagination and a warm heart.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>said Lady Delacour, `we have all of us seen Pamela maritata -- let us now see Belinda in love, if that be possible. If! forgive me this last stroke, my dear -- in spite of all my raillery, I do believe that the prudent Belinda is more capable of feeling real permanent passion than any of the dear sentimental young ladies, whose motto is

<p/><div class="bookquote">``All for love, or the world well lost.'' (<font color='red'><b>the ladies</b></font>)</div>'
<div class="bookquote">``That is just my opinion,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Delacour/Mrs Margaret Delacour/Margaret</b></font>)</div>said Mrs Margaret Delacour. <div class="bookquote">``But pray, what is become of Mr Hartley?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>looking round: <div class="bookquote">``I do not see him (<font color='blue'><b>Hartley</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No: for I have hid him (<font color='blue'><b>Hartley</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>said Lady Delacour: `he (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) shall be forthcoming presently.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear Mr Clarence Hervey, what have you done with my Virginia?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Ormond/Ormond</b></font>)</div>said Mrs Ormond, coming into the room.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear Mrs Ormond, what have you done with her (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div>replied Clarence. <div class="bookquote">``By your mistaken kindness, by insisting upon doing us both good against our wills, you were very near making us both miserable for life. But I blame nobody: I have no right to blame any one so much as myself. All this has arisen from my own presumption and imprudence. Nothing could be more absurd than my scheme of educating a woman in solitude to make her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) fit for society. I might have foreseen what must happen, that Virginia would consider me as her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) tutor, her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) father, not as her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) lover, or her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) husband; that with the most affectionate of hearts, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) could for me feel nothing but gratitude.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing but gratitude!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Ormond/Ormond</b></font>)</div>repeated Mrs Ormond, with a degree of amazement in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) countenance, which made every body present smile: <div class="bookquote">``I am sure I thought she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was dying for love of you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Ormond/Ormond</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear Belinda,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>whispered Lady Delacour, `if I might judge of the colour of this cheek, which has been for some moments permanent crimson, I should guess that you were beginning to find out of what use the sun is to the dial.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You will not let me hear what Mr Hervey is saying,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>replied Belinda; <div class="bookquote">``I am very curious.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Curiosity is a stronger passion than love, as I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>) just now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>said Lady Delacour.

<p/>In spite of all his (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) explanations, Mrs Ormond could not be made to comprehend Virginia's feelings. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) continually repeated, <div class="bookquote">``But it is impossible for Virginia, or for any body, to be in love with a picture.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is not said that she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) is in love with a picture,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Delacour/Mrs Margaret Delacour/Margaret</b></font>)</div>replied Mrs Delacour, `though even for that I could find you a precedent.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My Lady Delacour,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Ormond/Ormond</b></font>)</div>said Mrs Ormond, `will you explain to us how that picture came into your possession, and how it came here, and, in short, all that is to be known about it?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, explain! explain! my dear Lady Delacour,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Delacour/Mrs Margaret Delacour/Margaret</b></font>)</div>cried Mrs Delacour: <div class="bookquote">``I am afraid I am grown almost as curious as my Lady Boucher. Explain! explain!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Delacour/Mrs Margaret Delacour/Margaret</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Most willingly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>said Lady Delacour. <div class="bookquote">``To Marriott's ruling passion for birds you are all of you indebted for this discovery. Some time ago, whilst we were at Twickenham, as Marriott was waiting at a stationer's, to bid her (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) last adieus to a bullfinch, a gentleman came into the shop where she (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) and Bobby -LRB-as she (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) calls this bird-RRB- were coquetting, and the gentleman was struck even more than Marriott with the bullfinch. He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) went almost distracted on hearing a particular tune, which this bird sang. I suspected, from the symptoms, that the gentleman must be, or must have been, in love with the bullfinch's mistress. Now the bullfinch was traced home to the ci-devant Virginia St Pierre, the present Miss Hartley. I had my reasons for being curious about her (<font color='blue'><b>Hartley</b></font>) loves and lovers, and as soon as I learned the story from Marriott, I determined, if possible, to find out who this stranger, with the strange passion for bullfinches, might be. I questioned and cross-questioned all those people at the stationer's who were present when he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) fell into ecstasies; and, from the shopman, who had been bribed to secrecy, I learned that our gentleman returned to the stationer's the day after he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) met Marriott, and watched till he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) obtained a sight of Virginia, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) came to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) window. Now it was believed by the girl of this shop, who had lived for some time with Mrs Ormond -- Forgive me, Mr Hervey, for what I am going to say -- forgive me, Mrs Ormond -- scandal, like death, is common to all -- It was believed that Virginia was Mr Hervey's mistress. My stranger no sooner learned this than he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) swore that he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) would think of her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) no more; and after bestowing a variety of seamen's execrations upon the villain who had seduced this heavenly creature, he (<font color='blue'><b>villain</b></font>) departed from Twickenham, and was no more seen or heard of. My inquiries after him (<font color='blue'><b>villain</b></font>) were indefatigable, but for some time unsuccessful: and so they might have continued, and we might have been all making one another unhappy at this moment, if it had not been for Mr Vincent's great dog Juba -- Miss Annabella Luttridge's billet-doux -- Sir Philip Baddely's insolence -- my Lord Delacour's belief in a quack balsam -- and Captain Sunderland's humanity.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Captain Sunderland! who is Captain Sunderland? we never heard of him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) before,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Ormond/Ormond</b></font>)</div>cried Mrs Ormond.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You shall hear of him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) just as I did, if you please,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>said Lady Delacour, `and if Belinda will submit to hear me tell the same story twice.''

<p/>Here her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) ladyship repeated the history of the battle of the dogs; and of Sir Philip Baddely's knocking down Juba, the man, for struggling in defence of Juba, the dog.

<p/>``Now the gentleman who assisted my Lord Delacour in bringing the disabled negro across the square to our house, was Captain Sunderland. My lord summoned Marriott to produce Lady Boucher's infallible balsam, that it might be tried upon Juba's sprained ankle. Whilst my lord was intent upon the balsam, Marriott was intent upon Captain Sunderland. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) recollected that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) had met him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) somewhere before, and the moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) spoke, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marriott</b></font>) knew him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) to be the gentleman who had fallen into ecstasies in the shop at Twickenham, about the bullfinch. Marriott hastened to me with the news; I hastened to my lord, made him (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) introduce Captain Sunderland to me, and I never rested till he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) had told me all that I wanted to know. Some years ago, just before he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) went to sea, he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) paid a visit to his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) mother, who then lodged with a widow Smith, in the New Forest. Whilst he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) was there, he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) heard of the young beauty who lived in the Forest, with a grandmother, who was not a little particular, and who would not permit any body to see her (<font color='blue'><b>grandmother</b></font>).

<p/>``My captain's curiosity was excited; one day, unseen by the duenna, he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) obtained a distinct view of Virginia, watering her (<font color='blue'><b>grandmother</b></font>) roses and tending her (<font color='blue'><b>grandmother</b></font>) bees. Struck with her (<font color='blue'><b>grandmother</b></font>) uncommon beauty, he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) approached carefully to the thicket in which the cottage was enclosed, and found a lair, where he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) concealed himself, day after day, and contemplated at leisure the budding charms of the fair wood-nymph. In short, he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) became so enamoured, that he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) was determined to gain admittance at the cottage, and declare his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) passion: but to his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) honour be it told, that when the history of the poor girl's mother, and the situation and fears of the old lady, who was her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) only friend, were known to him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>), in consideration of the extreme youth of the ward, and the extreme age of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) guardian, he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) determined to defer his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) addresses till his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) return from the West Indies, whither he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) was shortly to sail, and where he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had hopes of making a fortune, that might put him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) in a situation to render the object of his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) affections independent. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) left a bullfinch with Mrs Smith, who gave it to Virginia, without telling to whom it had belonged, lest her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) grandmother might be displeased.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I really thought that all this showed too nice a moral sense for a young dashing lieutenant in the navy, and I was persuaded that my gentleman was only keeping his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) mistress's secret like a man of honour. With this belief, I regretted that Clarence Hervey should throw himself away upon a girl who was unworthy of him (<font color='blue'><b>Hervey</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div>interrupted Clarence, `you are perfectly convinced of your mistake.''

<p/>``Perfectly! perfectly! -- I am convinced that Virginia is only half mad. But let me go on with my story. I was determined to discover whether she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had any remains of affection for this captain. It was in vain he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) assured me that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had never seen him (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>). I prevailed upon him (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) to let me go on my own way. I inquired whether he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) had ever had his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) picture drawn. Yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) had for his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) mother, just when he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) first went out to sea. It had been left at the widow Smith's. I begged him (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) to procure it for me. He (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) told me it was impossible. I told him (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) I trampled on impossibilities. In short, he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) got the picture for me, as you see. ``Now,'' thought I, ``if he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) speaks the truth, Virginia will see this picture without emotion, and it will only seem to be a present for Clarence. But if she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) had ever seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) before, or had any secret to conceal, she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) will betray herself on the sudden appearance of this picture.<div class="bookquote">'' Things have turned out contrary to all my expectations, and yet better. -- And now, Clarence, I must beg you will prevail on Miss Hartley to appear: I can go on no farther without her (<font color='blue'><b>Hartley</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Lady Delacour took Virginia by the hand, the moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) entered the room.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Will you trust yourself with me, Miss Hartley?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I have made you faint once to-day by the sight of a picture; will you promise me not to faint again, when I produce the original?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The original!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Virginia. <div class="bookquote">``I will trust myself with you, for I am sure you cannot mean to laugh at me, though, perhaps, I deserve to be laughed at.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div><p/>Lady Delacour threw open the door of another apartment. Mr Hartley appeared, and with him (<font color='blue'><b>Hartley</b></font>) Captain Sunderland.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear daughter,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr Hartley/Hartley</b></font>)</div>said Mr Hartley, `give me leave to introduce to you a friend, to whom I owe more obligations than to any man living, except to Mr Hervey. This gentleman was stationed some years ago at Jamaica, and in a rebellion of the negroes on my plantation he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) saved my life. Fortune has accidentally thrown my benefactor in my way. To show my sense of my obligations is out of my power.''

<p/>Virginia's surprise was extreme; her (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) vivid dreams, the fond wishes of her (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) waking fancy, were at once accomplished. For the first moment she (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) gazed as on an animated picture, and all the ideas of love and romance associated with this image rushed upon her (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) mind.

<p/>But when the realities by which he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was surrounded dispelled the illusion, she (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) suddenly withdrew her (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) eyes, and blushed deeply, with such timid and graceful modesty as charmed every body present.

<p/>Captain Sunderland pressed forward; but was stopped by Lady Delacour.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Avaunt, thou real lover!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>cried she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>): `none but the shadow of a man can hope to approach the visionary maid. In vain has Marraton forced his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) way through the bushes and briars, in vain has he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) braved the apparition of the lion; there is yet a phantom barrier apparently impassable between him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) Yaratilda, for he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is in the world of shadows. Now, mark me, Marraton: hurry not this delicate spirit, or perchance you frighten and lose her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) for ever; but have patience, and gradually and gracefully she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) will venture into your world of realities -- only give her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) time.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Time! O yes, give me time,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>cried Virginia, shrinking back.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear Miss Hartley,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>continued Lady Delacour, `in plain prose, to prevent all difficulties and embarrassments, I must inform you, that Captain Sunderland will not insist upon prompt payment of your father's debt of gratitude: he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) has but one quarter of an hour to spend with us -- he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) is actually under sailing orders; so that you will have time to compose your mind before his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) return. Clarence, I advise you to accompany Captain Sunderland on this cruise; don't you, Belinda?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And now, my good friends,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>continued Lady Delacour, `shall I finish the novel for you?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If your ladyship pleases; nobody can do it better,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clarence Hervey/Mr Hervey/Clarence</b></font>)</div>said Clarence Hervey.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But I hope you will remember, dear Lady Delacour,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda/Miss Portman/Belinda Portman</b></font>)</div>said Belinda, `that there is nothing in which novelists are so apt to err as in hurrying things toward the conclusion: in not allowing time enough for that change of feeling, which change of situation cannot instantly produce.''

<p/>``That's right, my dear Belinda; true to your principles to the last gasp. Fear nothing -- you shall have time enough to become accustomed to Clarence. Would you choose that I should draw out the story to five volumes more? With your advice and assistance, I can with the greatest ease, my dear. A declaration of love, you know, is only the beginning of things; there may be blushes, and sighs, and doubts, and fears, and misunderstandings, and jealousies without end or common sense, to fill up the necessary space, and to gain the necessary time; but if I might conclude the business in two lines, I should say,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ye gods, annihilate both space and time,
And make four lovers happy.'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'
<div class="bookquote">``Oh, that would be cutting matters too short,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Delacour/Mrs Margaret Delacour/Margaret</b></font>)</div>said Mrs Margaret Delacour. <div class="bookquote">``I am of the old school; and though I could dispense with the description of Miss Harriot Byron's worked chairs and fine china, yet I own I like to hear something of the preparations for a marriage, as well as of the mere wedding. I like to hear how people become happy in a rational manner, better than to be told in the huddled style of an old fairy tale -- and so they were all married, and they lived very happily all the rest of their days.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We are not in much danger of hearing such an account of modern marriages,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Delacour/Delacour/lady Delacour</b></font>)</div>said Lady Delacour. ``But how shall I please you all? -- Some people cry, <div class="bookquote">``Tell me every thing;''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>others say, that,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Le secret d'ennuyer est eclui de tout dire.''
 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Something must be left to the imagination. Positively I will not describe wedding-dresses, or a procession to church. I have no objection to saying that the happy couple were united by the worthy Mr Moreton; that Mr Percival gave Belinda away; and that immediately after the ceremony, he (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) took the whole party down with him (<font color='blue'><b>Percival</b></font>) to Oakly-park. Will this do? -- Or, we may conclude, if you like it better, with a characteristic letter of congratulation from Mrs Stanhope to her (<font color='blue'><b>Stanhope</b></font>) dearest niece, Belinda, acknowledging that she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) was wrong to quarrel with her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) for refusing Sir Philip Baddely, and giving her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) infinite credit for that admirable management of Clarence Hervey, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) hopes will continue through life.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I have no objection to ending with a letter,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Delacour/Mrs Margaret Delacour/Margaret</b></font>)</div>said Mrs Delacour; `for last speeches are always tiresome.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>ladyship</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) ladyship; `it is so difficult, as the Critic says, to get lovers off upon their knees. Now I think of it, let me place you all in proper attitudes for stage effect. What signifies being happy, unless we appear so? -- Captain Sunderland -- kneeling with Virginia, if you please, sir, at her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) father's feet: you in the act of giving them your blessing, Mr Hartley. Mrs Ormond clasps her (<font color='blue'><b>Ormond</b></font>) hands with joy -- nothing can he (<font color='blue'><b>Hartley</b></font>) better than that, madam -- I give you infinite credit for the attitude. Clarence, you have a right to Belinda's hand, and may kiss it too: nay, Miss Portman, it is the rule of the stage. Now, where's my Lord Delacour? he (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) should be embracing me, to show that we are reconciled. Ha! here he (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) comes -- Enter Lord Delacour, with little Helena in his (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) hand -- very well! a good start of surprise, my love -- stand still, pray; you cannot be better than you are: Helena, my love, do not let go your father's hand. There! quite pretty and natural! Now, Lady Delacour, to show that she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) is reformed, comes forward to address the audience with a moral -- a moral! Yes,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Our tale contains a moral; and, no doubt
You all have wit enough to find it out.'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'

<p/>Notes:


<p/>1 This declaration was taken from the lips of a celebrated character.

<p/>2The manners, if not the morals, of gentlemen, have improved since the first publication of this work. Swearing has gone out of fashion. But Sir Philip Baddely's oaths are retained, as marks in a portrait of the times held up to the public, touched by ridicule, the best reprobation.

<p/>3The bloody hand is the heraldic designation of the baronet.
