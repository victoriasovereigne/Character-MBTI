<p/>Chapter I

<p/>My father's family name being Pirrip, and my Christian name Philip, my
infant tongue could make of both names nothing longer or more explicit
than Pip. So, I called myself Pip, and came to be called Pip.

<p/>I give Pirrip as my father's family name, on the authority of his (<font color='blue'><b>Pirrip</b></font>)
tombstone and my sister,--Mrs. Joe Gargery, who married the blacksmith.
As I never saw my father or my mother, and never saw any likeness
of either of them -LRB-for their days were long before the days of
photographs-RRB-, my first fancies regarding what they were like were
unreasonably derived from their tombstones. The shape of the letters on
my father's, gave me an odd idea that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was a square, stout, dark man,
with curly black hair. From the character and turn of the inscription,
<div class="bookquote">``Also Georgiana Wife of the Above,''  (<font color='red'><b>the character turn</b></font>)</div>I drew a childish conclusion that
my mother was freckled and sickly. To five little stone lozenges, each
about a foot and a half long, which were arranged in a neat row beside
their grave, and were sacred to the memory of five little brothers of
mine,--who gave up trying to get a living, exceedingly early in
that universal struggle,--I am indebted for a belief I religiously
entertained that they had all been born on their backs with their hands
in their trousers-pockets, and had never taken them out in this state of
existence.

<p/>Ours was the marsh country, down by the river, within, as the river
wound, twenty miles of the sea. My first most vivid and broad impression
of the identity of things seems to me to have been gained on a memorable
raw afternoon towards evening. At such a time I found out for certain
that this bleak place overgrown with nettles was the churchyard; and
that Philip Pirrip, late of this parish, and also Georgiana wife of the
above, were dead and buried; and that Alexander, Bartholomew, Abraham,
Tobias, and Roger, infant children of the aforesaid, were also dead
and buried; and that the dark flat wilderness beyond the churchyard,
intersected with dikes and mounds and gates, with scattered cattle
feeding on it, was the marshes; and that the low leaden line beyond
was the river; and that the distant savage lair from which the wind was
rushing was the sea; and that the small bundle of shivers growing afraid
of it all and beginning to cry, was Pip.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hold your noise!''  (<font color='red'><b>a man</b></font>)</div>cried a terrible voice, as a man started up from
among the graves at the side of the church porch. <div class="bookquote">``Keep still, you
little devil, or I'll cut your throat!''

 (<font color='red'><b>A man all</b></font>)</div><p/>A fearful man, all in coarse gray, with a great iron on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) leg. A man
with no hat, and with broken shoes, and with an old rag tied round his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
head. A man who had been soaked in water, and smothered in mud, and
lamed by stones, and cut by flints, and stung by nettles, and torn by
briars; who limped, and shivered, and glared, and growled; and whose
teeth chattered in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) seized me by the chin.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! Don't cut my throat, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I pleaded in terror. <div class="bookquote">``Pray don't do it,
sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell us your name!''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the man. <div class="bookquote">``Quick!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pip, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Once more,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the man, staring at me. <div class="bookquote">``Give it mouth!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pip. Pip, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Show us where you live,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the man. <div class="bookquote">``Pint out the place!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I pointed to where our village lay, on the flat in-shore among the
alder-trees and pollards, a mile or more from the church.

<p/>The man, after looking at me for a moment, turned me upside down, and
emptied my pockets. There was nothing in them but a piece of bread. When
the church came to itself,--for he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was so sudden and strong that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
made it go head over heels before me, and I saw the steeple under my
feet,--when the church came to itself, I say, I was seated on a high
tombstone, trembling while he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ate the bread ravenously.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You young dog,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the man, licking his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lips, <div class="bookquote">``what fat cheeks you
ha' got.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/>I believe they were fat, though I was at that time undersized for my
years, and not strong.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Darn me if I couldn't eat em,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the man, with a threatening shake
of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head, <div class="bookquote">``and if I han't half a mind to't!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/>I earnestly expressed my hope that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wouldn't, and held tighter to
the tombstone on which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had put me; partly, to keep myself upon it;
partly, to keep myself from crying.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now lookee here!''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the man. <div class="bookquote">``Where's your mother?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There, sir!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) started, made a short run, and stopped and looked over his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shoulder.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There, sir!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I timidly explained. <div class="bookquote">``Also Georgiana. That's my mother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), coming back. <div class="bookquote">``And is that your father alonger your
mother?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I; <div class="bookquote">``him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) too; late of this parish.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ha!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) muttered then, considering. <div class="bookquote">``Who d’ye live with,--supposin'
you're kindly let to live, which I han't made up my mind about?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My sister, sir,--Mrs. Joe Gargery,--wife of Joe Gargery, the
blacksmith, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Blacksmith, eh?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). And looked down at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) leg.

<p/>After darkly looking at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) leg and me several times, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) came closer
to my tombstone, took me by both arms, and tilted me back as far as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
could hold me; so that his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes looked most powerfully down into mine,
and mine looked most helplessly up into his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now lookee here,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``the question being whether you're to be let
to live. You know what a file is?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you know what wittles is?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>After each question he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) tilted me over a little more, so as to give me a
greater sense of helplessness and danger.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You get me a file.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) tilted me again. <div class="bookquote">``And you get me wittles.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
tilted me again. <div class="bookquote">``You bring `em both to me.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) tilted me again. <div class="bookquote">``Or
I'll have your heart and liver out.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) tilted me again.

<p/>I was dreadfully frightened, and so giddy that I clung to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) with both
hands, and said, <div class="bookquote">``If you would kindly please to let me keep upright,
sir, perhaps I shouldn't be sick, and perhaps I could attend more.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) gave me a most tremendous dip and roll, so that the church jumped
over its own weathercock. Then, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) held me by the arms, in an upright
position on the top of the stone, and went on in these fearful terms:--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You bring me, to-morrow morning early, that file and them wittles. You
bring the lot to me, at that old Battery over yonder. You do it, and you
never dare to say a word or dare to make a sign concerning your having
seen such a person as me, or any person sumever, and you shall be let to
live. You fail, or you go from my words in any partickler, no matter how
small it is, and your heart and your liver shall be tore out, roasted,
and ate. Now, I ain't alone, as you may think I am. There's a young man
hid with me, in comparison with which young man I am a Angel. That young
man hears the words I speak. That young man has a secret way pecooliar
to himself, of getting at a boy, and at his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) heart, and at his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) liver. It
is in wain for a boy to attempt to hide himself from that young man. A
boy may lock his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) door, may be warm in bed, may tuck himself up, may draw
the clothes over his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) head, may think himself comfortable and safe, but
that young man will softly creep and creep his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) way to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and tear him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
open. I am a keeping that young man from harming of you at the present
moment, with great difficulty. I find it wery hard to hold that young
man off of your inside. Now, what do you say?''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>I said that I would get him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) the file, and I would get him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) what broken
bits of food I could, and I would come to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) at the Battery, early in
the morning.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Say Lord strike you dead if you don't!''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the man.

<p/>I said so, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) took me down.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pursued, <div class="bookquote">``you remember what you've undertook, and you remember
that young man, and you get home!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Goo-good night, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I faltered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Much of that!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), glancing about him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) over the cold wet flat. <div class="bookquote">``I
wish I was a frog. Or a eel!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>At the same time, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hugged his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shuddering body in both his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
arms,--clasping himself, as if to hold himself together,--and limped
towards the low church wall. As I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) go, picking his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) way among the
nettles, and among the brambles that bound the green mounds, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) looked
in my young eyes as if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) were eluding the hands of the dead people,
stretching up cautiously out of their graves, to get a twist upon his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
ankle and pull him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in.

<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) came to the low church wall, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) got over it, like a man whose
legs were numbed and stiff, and then turned round to look for me. When I
saw him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) turning, I set my face towards home, and made the best use of
my legs. But presently I looked over my shoulder, and saw him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) going on
again towards the river, still hugging himself in both arms, and picking
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) way with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sore feet among the great stones dropped into the
marshes here and there, for stepping-places when the rains were heavy or
the tide was in.

<p/>The marshes were just a long black horizontal line then, as I stopped
to look after him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>); and the river was just another horizontal line, not
nearly so broad nor yet so black; and the sky was just a row of long
angry red lines and dense black lines intermixed. On the edge of the
river I could faintly make out the only two black things in all the
prospect that seemed to be standing upright; one of these was the beacon
by which the sailors steered,--like an unhooped cask upon a pole,--an
ugly thing when you were near it; the other, a gibbet, with some chains
hanging to it which had once held a pirate. The man was limping on
towards this latter, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) were the pirate come to life, and come
down, and going back to hook himself up again. It gave me a terrible
turn when I thought so; and as I saw the cattle lifting their heads to
gaze after him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), I wondered whether they thought so too. I looked all
round for the horrible young man, and could see no signs of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). But now
I was frightened again, and ran home without stopping.




<p/>Chapter II

<p/>My sister, Mrs. Joe Gargery, was more than twenty years older than I,
and had established a great reputation with herself and the neighbors
because she (<font color='blue'><b>Gargery</b></font>) had brought me up <div class="bookquote">``by hand.''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>Having at that time to find out
for myself what the expression meant, and knowing her (<font color='blue'><b>Gargery</b></font>) to have a hard and
heavy hand, and to be much in the habit of laying it upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Gargery</b></font>) husband as
well as upon me, I supposed that Joe Gargery and I were both brought up
by hand.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Gargery</b></font>) was not a good-looking woman, my sister; and I had a general
impression that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gargery</b></font>) must have made Joe Gargery marry her (<font color='blue'><b>Gargery</b></font>) by hand. Joe
was a fair man, with curls of flaxen hair on each side of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) smooth
face, and with eyes of such a very undecided blue that they seemed
to have somehow got mixed with their own whites. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was a mild,
good-natured, sweet-tempered, easy-going, foolish, dear fellow,--a sort
of Hercules in strength, and also in weakness.

<p/>My sister, Mrs. Joe, with black hair and eyes, had such a prevailing
redness of skin that I sometimes used to wonder whether it was possible
she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) washed herself with a nutmeg-grater instead of soap. She (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) was tall
and bony, and almost always wore a coarse apron, fastened over her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>)
figure behind with two loops, and having a square impregnable bib in
front, that was stuck full of pins and needles. She (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) made it a powerful
merit in herself, and a strong reproach against Joe, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) wore this
apron so much. Though I really see no reason why she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) should have worn it
at all; or why, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) did wear it at all, she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) should not have taken it
off, every day of her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) life.

<p/>Joe's forge adjoined our house, which was a wooden house, as many of the
dwellings in our country were,--most of them, at that time. When I ran
home from the churchyard, the forge was shut up, and Joe was sitting
alone in the kitchen. Joe and I being fellow-sufferers, and having
confidences as such, Joe imparted a confidence to me, the moment I
raised the latch of the door and peeped in at him (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) opposite to it,
sitting in the chimney corner.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Joe has been out a dozen times, looking for you, Pip. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>)'s
out now, making it a baker's dozen.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Pip,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>said Joe; <div class="bookquote">``and what's worse, she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>)'s got Tickler with her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div><p/>At this dismal intelligence, I twisted the only button on my waistcoat
round and round, and looked in great depression at the fire. Tickler
was a wax-ended piece of cane, worn smooth by collision with my tickled
frame.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) sot down,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>said Joe, <div class="bookquote">``and she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) got up, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) made a grab at
Tickler, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) Ram-paged out. That's what she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) did,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>said Joe, slowly
clearing the fire between the lower bars with the poker, and looking at
it; <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) Ram-paged out, Pip.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Has she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) been gone long, Joe?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I always treated him (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) as a larger species
of child, and as no more than my equal.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>said Joe, glancing up at the Dutch clock, <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>)'s been on the
Ram-page, this last spell, about five minutes, Pip. She (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>)'s a coming! Get
behind the door, old chap, and have the jack-towel betwixt you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div><p/>I took the advice. My sister, Mrs. Joe, throwing the door wide open,
and finding an obstruction behind it, immediately divined the cause, and
applied Tickler to its further investigation. She (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) concluded by throwing
me--I often served as a connubial missile--at Joe, who, glad to get hold
of me on any terms, passed me on into the chimney and quietly fenced me
up there with his (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) great leg.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where have you been, you young monkey?''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Joe, stamping her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>)
foot. <div class="bookquote">``Tell me directly what you've been doing to wear me away with fret
and fright and worrit, or I'd have you out of that corner if you was
fifty Pips, and he (<font color='blue'><b>monkey</b></font>) was five hundred Gargerys.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have only been to the churchyard,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, from my stool, crying and
rubbing myself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Churchyard!''  (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div>repeated my sister. <div class="bookquote">``If it warn't for me you'd have been
to the churchyard long ago, and stayed there. Who brought you up by
hand?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You did,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And why did I do it, I should like to know?''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>exclaimed my sister.

<p/>I whimpered, <div class="bookquote">``I don't know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't!''  (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div>said my sister. <div class="bookquote">``I'd never do it again! I know that. I may
truly say I've never had this apron of mine off since born you were.
It's bad enough to be a blacksmith's wife -LRB-and him (<font color='blue'><b>blacksmith</b></font>) a Gargery-RRB- without
being your mother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>My thoughts strayed from that question as I looked disconsolately at
the fire. For the fugitive out on the marshes with the ironed leg, the
mysterious young man, the file, the food, and the dreadful pledge I was
under to commit a larceny on those sheltering premises, rose before me
in the avenging coals.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hah!''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Joe, restoring Tickler to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) station. <div class="bookquote">``Churchyard,
indeed! You may well say churchyard, you two.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>One of us, by the by, had
not said it at all. <div class="bookquote">``You'll drive me to the churchyard betwixt you, one
of these days, and O, a pr-r-recious pair you'd be without me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>As she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) applied herself to set the tea-things, Joe peeped down at me
over his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) leg, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) were mentally casting me and himself up, and
calculating what kind of pair we practically should make, under the
grievous circumstances foreshadowed. After that, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sat feeling his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
right-side flaxen curls and whisker, and following Mrs. Joe about with
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) blue eyes, as his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) manner always was at squally times.

<p/>My sister had a trenchant way of cutting our bread and butter for us,
that never varied. First, with her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) left hand she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) jammed the loaf hard
and fast against her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) bib,--where it sometimes got a pin into it, and
sometimes a needle, which we afterwards got into our mouths. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)
took some butter -LRB-not too much-RRB- on a knife and spread it on the loaf, in
an apothecary kind of way, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) were making a plaster,--using both
sides of the knife with a slapping dexterity, and trimming and moulding
the butter off round the crust. Then, she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) gave the knife a final smart
wipe on the edge of the plaster, and then sawed a very thick round off
the loaf: which she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) finally, before separating from the loaf, hewed into
two halves, of which Joe got one, and I the other.

<p/>On the present occasion, though I was hungry, I dared not eat my
slice. I felt that I must have something in reserve for my dreadful
acquaintance, and his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) ally the still more dreadful young man. I knew
Mrs. Joe's housekeeping to be of the strictest kind, and that my
larcenous researches might find nothing available in the safe. Therefore
I resolved to put my hunk of bread and butter down the leg of my
trousers.

<p/>The effort of resolution necessary to the achievement of this purpose I
found to be quite awful. It was as if I had to make up my mind to leap
from the top of a high house, or plunge into a great depth of water.
And it was made the more difficult by the unconscious Joe. In
our already-mentioned freemasonry as fellow-sufferers, and in his (<font color='blue'><b>hunk</b></font>)
good-natured companionship with me, it was our evening habit to compare
the way we bit through our slices, by silently holding them up to each
other's admiration now and then,--which stimulated us to new exertions.
To-night, Joe several times invited me, by the display of his (<font color='blue'><b>hunk</b></font>) fast
diminishing slice, to enter upon our usual friendly competition; but
he (<font color='blue'><b>hunk</b></font>) found me, each time, with my yellow mug of tea on one knee, and
my untouched bread and butter on the other. At last, I desperately
considered that the thing I contemplated must be done, and that it
had best be done in the least improbable manner consistent with the
circumstances. I took advantage of a moment when Joe had just looked at
me, and got my bread and butter down my leg.

<p/>Joe was evidently made uncomfortable by what he (<font color='blue'><b>hunk</b></font>) supposed to be my loss
of appetite, and took a thoughtful bite out of his (<font color='blue'><b>hunk</b></font>) slice, which he (<font color='blue'><b>hunk</b></font>)
didn't seem to enjoy. He (<font color='blue'><b>hunk</b></font>) turned it about in his (<font color='blue'><b>hunk</b></font>) mouth much longer than
usual, pondering over it a good deal, and after all gulped it down like
a pill. He (<font color='blue'><b>hunk</b></font>) was about to take another bite, and had just got his (<font color='blue'><b>hunk</b></font>) head on
one side for a good purchase on it, when his (<font color='blue'><b>hunk</b></font>) eye fell on me, and he (<font color='blue'><b>hunk</b></font>) saw
that my bread and butter was gone.

<p/>The wonder and consternation with which Joe stopped on the threshold
of his (<font color='blue'><b>hunk</b></font>) bite and stared at me, were too evident to escape my sister's
observation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What's the matter now?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>), smartly, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) put down her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) cup.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I say, you know!''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>muttered Joe, shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>hunk</b></font>) head at me in very serious
remonstrance. <div class="bookquote">``Pip, old chap! You'll do yourself a mischief. It'll stick
somewhere. You can't have chawed it, Pip.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What's the matter now?''  (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div>repeated my sister, more sharply than before.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you can cough any trifle on it up, Pip, I'd recommend you to do it,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>said Joe, all aghast. <div class="bookquote">``Manners is manners, but still your elth's your
elth.''

 (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div><p/>By this time, my sister was quite desperate, so she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) pounced on Joe,
and, taking him (<font color='blue'><b>hunk</b></font>) by the two whiskers, knocked his (<font color='blue'><b>hunk</b></font>) head for a little while
against the wall behind him (<font color='blue'><b>hunk</b></font>), while I sat in the corner, looking guiltily
on.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, perhaps you'll mention what's the matter,''  (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div>said my sister, out of
breath, <div class="bookquote">``you staring great stuck pig.''

 (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div><p/>Joe looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) in a helpless way, then took a helpless bite, and
looked at me again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You know, Pip,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>said Joe, solemnly, with his (<font color='blue'><b>hunk</b></font>) last bite in his (<font color='blue'><b>hunk</b></font>) cheek,
and speaking in a confidential voice, as if we two were quite alone,
<div class="bookquote">``you and me is always friends, and I'd be the last to tell upon you,
any time. But such a--''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>hunk</b></font>) moved his (<font color='blue'><b>hunk</b></font>) chair and looked about the floor
between us, and then again at me--<div class="bookquote">``such a most oncommon Bolt as that!''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Been bolting his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) food, has he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div>cried my sister.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You know, old chap,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>said Joe, looking at me, and not at Mrs. Joe,
with his (<font color='blue'><b>hunk</b></font>) bite still in his (<font color='blue'><b>hunk</b></font>) cheek, <div class="bookquote">``I Bolted, myself, when I was your
age--frequent--and as a boy I've been among a many Bolters; but I never
see your Bolting equal yet, Pip, and it's a mercy you ain't Bolted
dead.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div><p/>My sister made a dive at me, and fished me up by the hair, saying
nothing more than the awful words, <div class="bookquote">``You come along and be dosed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>Some medical beast had revived Tar-water in those days as a fine
medicine, and Mrs. Joe always kept a supply of it in the cupboard;
having a belief in its virtues correspondent to its nastiness. At the
best of times, so much of this elixir was administered to me as a choice
restorative, that I was conscious of going about, smelling like a new
fence. On this particular evening the urgency of my case demanded a
pint of this mixture, which was poured down my throat, for my greater
comfort, while Mrs. Joe held my head under her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) arm, as a boot would
be held in a bootjack. Joe got off with half a pint; but was made to
swallow that -LRB-much to his (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) disturbance, as he (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) sat slowly munching and
meditating before the fire-RRB-, <div class="bookquote">``because he (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) had had a turn.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Judging from
myself, I should say he (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) certainly had a turn afterwards, if he (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) had had
none before.

<p/>Conscience is a dreadful thing when it accuses man or boy; but when, in
the case of a boy, that secret burden co-operates with another secret
burden down the leg of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) trousers, it is -LRB-as I can testify-RRB- a great
punishment. The guilty knowledge that I was going to rob Mrs. Joe--I
never thought I was going to rob Joe, for I never thought of any of the
housekeeping property as his (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>)--united to the necessity of always keeping
one hand on my bread and butter as I sat, or when I was ordered about
the kitchen on any small errand, almost drove me out of my mind. Then,
as the marsh winds made the fire glow and flare, I thought I heard the
voice outside, of the man with the iron on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) leg who had sworn me to
secrecy, declaring that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) couldn't and wouldn't starve until to-morrow,
but must be fed now. At other times, I thought, What if the young man
who was with so much difficulty restrained from imbruing his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hands in me
should yield to a constitutional impatience, or should mistake the time,
and should think himself accredited to my heart and liver to-night,
instead of to-morrow! If ever anybody's hair stood on end with terror,
mine must have done so then. But, perhaps, nobody's ever did?

<p/>It was Christmas Eve, and I had to stir the pudding for next day, with
a copper-stick, from seven to eight by the Dutch clock. I tried it with
the load upon my leg -LRB-and that made me think afresh of the man with the
load on HIS (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) leg-RRB-, and found the tendency of exercise to bring the bread
and butter out at my ankle, quite unmanageable. Happily I slipped away,
and deposited that part of my conscience in my garret bedroom.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hark!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, when I had done my stirring, and was taking a final warm
in the chimney corner before being sent up to bed; <div class="bookquote">``was that great guns,
Joe?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah!''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>said Joe. <div class="bookquote">``There's another conwict off.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What does that mean, Joe?''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I.

<p/>Mrs. Joe, who always took explanations upon herself, said, snappishly,
<div class="bookquote">``Escaped. Escaped.''  (<font color='red'><b>I. Mrs. Joe</b></font>)</div>Administering the definition like Tar-water.

<p/>While Mrs. Joe sat with her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) head bending over her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) needlework, I put my
mouth into the forms of saying to Joe, <div class="bookquote">``What's a convict?''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>Joe put his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)
mouth into the forms of returning such a highly elaborate answer, that I
could make out nothing of it but the single word <div class="bookquote">``Pip.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There was a conwict off last night,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>said Joe, aloud, <div class="bookquote">``after
sunset-gun. And they fired warning of him (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>). And now it appears they're
firing warning of another.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who's firing?''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Drat that boy,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>interposed my sister, frowning at me over her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) work,
<div class="bookquote">``what a questioner he (<font color='blue'><b>questioner</b></font>) is. Ask no questions, and you'll be told no lies.''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>It was not very polite to herself, I thought, to imply that I should be
told lies by her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) even if I did ask questions. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) never was polite
unless there was company.

<p/>At this point Joe greatly augmented my curiosity by taking the utmost
pains to open his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) mouth very wide, and to put it into the form of a word
that looked to me like <div class="bookquote">``sulks.''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>Therefore, I naturally pointed to Mrs.
Joe, and put my mouth into the form of saying, <div class="bookquote">``her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>But Joe wouldn't
hear of that, at all, and again opened his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) mouth very wide, and shook
the form of a most emphatic word out of it. But I could make nothing of
the word.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Joe,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, as a last resort, <div class="bookquote">``I should like to know--if you
wouldn't much mind--where the firing comes from?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Lord bless the boy!''  (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div>exclaimed my sister, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) didn't quite mean
that but rather the contrary. <div class="bookquote">``From the Hulks!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh-h!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, looking at Joe. <div class="bookquote">``Hulks!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div><p/>Joe gave a reproachful cough, as much as to say, <div class="bookquote">``Well, I told you so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And please, what's Hulks?''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's the way with this boy!''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>exclaimed my sister, pointing me out
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) needle and thread, and shaking her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) head at me. <div class="bookquote">``Answer him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) one
question, and he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)'ll ask you a dozen directly. Hulks are prison-ships,
right `cross th' meshes.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>We always used that name for marshes, in our
country.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wonder who's put into prison-ships, and why they're put there?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said
I, in a general way, and with quiet desperation.

<p/>It was too much for Mrs. Joe, who immediately rose. <div class="bookquote">``I tell you what,
young fellow,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``I didn't bring you up by hand to badger
people's lives out. It would be blame to me and not praise, if I had.
People are put in the Hulks because they murder, and because they rob,
and forge, and do all sorts of bad; and they always begin by asking
questions. Now, you get along to bed!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>I was never allowed a candle to light me to bed, and, as I went upstairs
in the dark, with my head tingling,--from Mrs. Joe's thimble
having played the tambourine upon it, to accompany her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) last words,--I
felt fearfully sensible of the great convenience that the hulks were
handy for me. I was clearly on my way there. I had begun by asking
questions, and I was going to rob Mrs. Joe.

<p/>Since that time, which is far enough away now, I have often thought
that few people know what secrecy there is in the young under terror.
No matter how unreasonable the terror, so that it be terror. I was in
mortal terror of the young man who wanted my heart and liver; I was
in mortal terror of my interlocutor with the iron leg; I was in mortal
terror of myself, from whom an awful promise had been extracted; I had
no hope of deliverance through my all-powerful sister, who repulsed
me at every turn; I am afraid to think of what I might have done on
requirement, in the secrecy of my terror.

<p/>If I slept at all that night, it was only to imagine myself drifting
down the river on a strong spring-tide, to the Hulks; a ghostly
pirate calling out to me through a speaking-trumpet, as I passed the
gibbet-station, that I had better come ashore and be hanged there at
once, and not put it off. I was afraid to sleep, even if I had been
inclined, for I knew that at the first faint dawn of morning I must rob
the pantry. There was no doing it in the night, for there was no getting
a light by easy friction then; to have got one I must have struck it out
of flint and steel, and have made a noise like the very pirate himself
rattling his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) chains.

<p/>As soon as the great black velvet pall outside my little window was shot
with gray, I got up and went downstairs; every board upon the way, and
every crack in every board calling after me, <div class="bookquote">``Stop thief!''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>and <div class="bookquote">``Get up,
Mrs. Joe!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>In the pantry, which was far more abundantly supplied than
usual, owing to the season, I was very much alarmed by a hare hanging
up by the heels, whom I rather thought I caught, when my back was half
turned, winking. I had no time for verification, no time for selection,
no time for anything, for I had no time to spare. I stole some bread,
some rind of cheese, about half a jar of mincemeat -LRB-which I tied up in
my pocket-handkerchief with my last night's slice-RRB-, some brandy from a
stone bottle -LRB-which I decanted into a glass bottle I had secretly used
for making that intoxicating fluid, Spanish-liquorice-water, up in my
room: diluting the stone bottle from a jug in the kitchen cupboard-RRB-,
a meat bone with very little on it, and a beautiful round compact pork
pie. I was nearly going away without the pie, but I was tempted to mount
upon a shelf, to look what it was that was put away so carefully in a
covered earthenware dish in a corner, and I found it was the pie, and
I took it in the hope that it was not intended for early use, and would
not be missed for some time.

<p/>There was a door in the kitchen, communicating with the forge; I
unlocked and unbolted that door, and got a file from among Joe's tools.
Then I put the fastenings as I had found them, opened the door at which
I had entered when I ran home last night, shut it, and ran for the misty
marshes.




<p/>Chapter III

<p/>It was a rimy morning, and very damp. I had seen the damp lying on the
outside of my little window, as if some goblin had been crying there all
night, and using the window for a pocket-handkerchief. Now, I saw the
damp lying on the bare hedges and spare grass, like a coarser sort of
spiders' webs; hanging itself from twig to twig and blade to blade. On
every rail and gate, wet lay clammy, and the marsh mist was so thick,
that the wooden finger on the post directing people to our village--a
direction which they never accepted, for they never came there--was
invisible to me until I was quite close under it. Then, as I looked up
at it, while it dripped, it seemed to my oppressed conscience like a
phantom devoting me to the Hulks.

<p/>The mist was heavier yet when I got out upon the marshes, so that
instead of my running at everything, everything seemed to run at me.
This was very disagreeable to a guilty mind. The gates and dikes and
banks came bursting at me through the mist, as if they cried as plainly
as could be, <div class="bookquote">``A boy with somebody else's pork pie! Stop him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>The
cattle came upon me with like suddenness, staring out of their eyes,
and steaming out of their nostrils, <div class="bookquote">``Halloa, young thief!''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>One black
ox, with a white cravat on,--who even had to my awakened conscience
something of a clerical air,--fixed me so obstinately with his (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) eyes,
and moved his (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) blunt head round in such an accusatory manner as I moved
round, that I blubbered out to him (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``I couldn't help it, sir! It wasn't
for myself I took it!''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Upon which he (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) put down his (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) head, blew a cloud of
smoke out of his (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) nose, and vanished with a kick-up of his (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) hind-legs and
a flourish of his (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) tail.

<p/>All this time, I was getting on towards the river; but however fast I
went, I couldn't warm my feet, to which the damp cold seemed riveted, as
the iron was riveted to the leg of the man I was running to meet. I knew
my way to the Battery, pretty straight, for I had been down there on a
Sunday with Joe, and Joe, sitting on an old gun, had told me that when
I was `prentice to him (<font color='blue'><b>prentice</b></font>), regularly bound, we would have such Larks there!
However, in the confusion of the mist, I found myself at last too far to
the right, and consequently had to try back along the river-side, on the
bank of loose stones above the mud and the stakes that staked the tide
out. Making my way along here with all despatch, I had just crossed a
ditch which I knew to be very near the Battery, and had just scrambled
up the mound beyond the ditch, when I saw the man sitting before me.
His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) back was towards me, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) arms folded, and was nodding
forward, heavy with sleep.

<p/>I thought he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would be more glad if I came upon him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) breakfast,
in that unexpected manner, so I went forward softly and touched him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) on
the shoulder. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) instantly jumped up, and it was not the same man, but
another man!

<p/>And yet this man was dressed in coarse gray, too, and had a great iron
on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) leg, and was lame, and hoarse, and cold, and was everything that
the other man was; except that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had not the same face, and had a flat
broad-brimmed low-crowned felt hat on. All this I saw in a moment, for
I had only a moment to see it in: he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) swore an oath at me, made a hit at
me,--it was a round weak blow that missed me and almost knocked himself
down, for it made him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stumble,--and then he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ran into the mist, stumbling
twice as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) went, and I lost him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's the young man!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I thought, feeling my heart shoot as I identified
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). I dare say I should have felt a pain in my liver, too, if I had
known where it was.

<p/>I was soon at the Battery after that, and there was the right
man,--hugging himself and limping to and fro, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had never all
night left off hugging and limping,--waiting for me. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was awfully
cold, to be sure. I half expected to see him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) drop down before my face
and die of deadly cold. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes looked so awfully hungry too, that when
I handed him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) the file and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) laid it down on the grass, it occurred to
me he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would have tried to eat it, if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had not seen my bundle. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did
not turn me upside down this time to get at what I had, but left me
right side upwards while I opened the bundle and emptied my pockets.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What's in the bottle, boy?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Brandy,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was already handing mincemeat down his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) throat in the most curious
manner,--more like a man who was putting it away somewhere in a violent
hurry, than a man who was eating it,--but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) left off to take some of
the liquor. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shivered all the while so violently, that it was quite
as much as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could do to keep the neck of the bottle between his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) teeth,
without biting it off.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think you have got the ague,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm much of your opinion, boy,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's bad about here,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I told him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``You've been lying out on the meshes,
and they're dreadful aguish. Rheumatic too.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll eat my breakfast afore they're the death of me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I'd do
that, if I was going to be strung up to that there gallows as there is
over there, directly afterwards. I'll beat the shivers so far, I'll bet
you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was gobbling mincemeat, meatbone, bread, cheese, and pork pie, all
at once: staring distrustfully while he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did so at the mist all round
us, and often stopping--even stopping his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) jaws--to listen. Some real or
fancied sound, some clink upon the river or breathing of beast upon the
marsh, now gave him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) a start, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said, suddenly,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You're not a deceiving imp? You brought no one with you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, sir! No!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nor giv' no one the office to follow you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``I believe you. You'd be but a fierce young hound
indeed, if at your time of life you could help to hunt a wretched
warmint hunted as near death and dunghill as this poor wretched warmint
is!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Something clicked in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) throat as if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had works in him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) like a clock,
and was going to strike. And he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) smeared his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ragged rough sleeve over his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
eyes.

<p/>Pitying his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) desolation, and watching him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) gradually settled down
upon the pie, I made bold to say, <div class="bookquote">``I am glad you enjoy it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did you speak?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I said I was glad you enjoyed it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thankee, my boy. I do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I had often watched a large dog of ours eating his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) food; and I now
noticed a decided similarity between the dog's way of eating, and the
man's. The man took strong sharp sudden bites, just like the dog. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
swallowed, or rather snapped up, every mouthful, too soon and too fast;
and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) looked sideways here and there while he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ate, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thought
there was danger in every direction of somebody's coming to take the pie
away. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was altogether too unsettled in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mind over it, to appreciate
it comfortably I thought, or to have anybody to dine with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), without
making a chop with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) jaws at the visitor. In all of which particulars
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was very like the dog.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am afraid you won't leave any of it for him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, timidly; after
a silence during which I had hesitated as to the politeness of making
the remark. <div class="bookquote">``There's no more to be got where that came from.''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>It was the
certainty of this fact that impelled me to offer the hint.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Leave any for him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)? Who's him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div>said my friend, stopping in his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)
crunching of pie-crust.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The young man. That you spoke of. That was hid with you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh ah!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) returned, with something like a gruff laugh. <div class="bookquote">``Him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)? Yes, yes!
He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) don't want no wittles.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) looked as if he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) did,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I.

<p/>The man stopped eating, and regarded me with the keenest scrutiny and
the greatest surprise.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Looked? When?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Just now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Where?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yonder,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, pointing; <div class="bookquote">``over there, where I found him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) nodding
asleep, and thought it was you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) held me by the collar and stared at me so, that I began to think his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
first idea about cutting my throat had revived.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dressed like you, you know, only with a hat,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I explained, trembling;
<div class="bookquote">``and--and'' (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>--I was very anxious to put this delicately--<div class="bookquote">``and with--the
same reason for wanting to borrow a file. Didn't you hear the cannon
last night?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then there was firing!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said to himself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wonder you shouldn't have been sure of that,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I returned, <div class="bookquote">``for
we heard it up at home, and that's farther away, and we were shut in
besides.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, see now!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``When a man's alone on these flats, with a
light head and a light stomach, perishing of cold and want, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hears
nothin' all night, but guns firing, and voices calling. Hears? He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sees
the soldiers, with their red coats lighted up by the torches carried
afore, closing in round him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). Hears his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) number called, hears himself
challenged, hears the rattle of the muskets, hears the orders `Make
ready! Present! Cover him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) steady, men!' and is laid hands on--and
there's nothin'! Why, if I see one pursuing party last night--coming up
in order, Damn `em, with their tramp, tramp--I see a hundred. And as to
firing! Why, I see the mist shake with the cannon, arter it was broad
day,--But this man'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had said all the rest, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had forgotten my
being there; <div class="bookquote">``did you notice anything in him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had a badly bruised face,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, recalling what I hardly knew I
knew.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not here?''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>exclaimed the man, striking his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) left cheek mercilessly, with
the flat of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, there!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Where is he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) crammed what little food was left, into the breast of
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) gray jacket. <div class="bookquote">``Show me the way he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) went. I'll pull him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) down, like a
bloodhound. Curse this iron on my sore leg! Give us hold of the file,
boy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I indicated in what direction the mist had shrouded the other man,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) looked up at it for an instant. But he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was down on the rank wet
grass, filing at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) iron like a madman, and not minding me or minding
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own leg, which had an old chafe upon it and was bloody, but which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
handled as roughly as if it had no more feeling in it than the file. I
was very much afraid of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) again, now that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had worked himself into
this fierce hurry, and I was likewise very much afraid of keeping away
from home any longer. I told him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) I must go, but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) took no notice, so
I thought the best thing I could do was to slip off. The last I saw
of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head was bent over his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knee and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was working hard at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
fetter, muttering impatient imprecations at it and at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) leg. The last
I heard of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), I stopped in the mist to listen, and the file was still
going.




<p/>Chapter IV

<p/>I fully expected to find a Constable in the kitchen, waiting to take me
up. But not only was there no Constable there, but no discovery had yet
been made of the robbery. Mrs. Joe was prodigiously busy in getting the
house ready for the festivities of the day, and Joe had been put upon
the kitchen doorstep to keep him (<font color='blue'><b>Constable</b></font>) out of the dust-pan,--an article into
which his (<font color='blue'><b>Constable</b></font>) destiny always led him (<font color='blue'><b>Constable</b></font>), sooner or later, when my sister was
vigorously reaping the floors of her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) establishment.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And where the deuce ha' you been?''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>was Mrs. Joe's Christmas salutation,
when I and my conscience showed ourselves.

<p/>I said I had been down to hear the Carols. <div class="bookquote">``Ah! well!''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>observed Mrs.
Joe. <div class="bookquote">``You might ha' done worse.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Not a doubt of that I thought.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps if I warn't a blacksmith's wife, and -LRB-what's the same thing-RRB- a
slave with her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) apron never off, I should have been to hear the Carols,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Joe. <div class="bookquote">``I'm rather partial to Carols, myself, and that's the
best of reasons for my never hearing any.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div><p/>Joe, who had ventured into the kitchen after me as the dustpan had
retired before us, drew the back of his (<font color='blue'><b>Constable</b></font>) hand across his (<font color='blue'><b>Constable</b></font>) nose with a
conciliatory air, when Mrs. Joe darted a look at him (<font color='blue'><b>Constable</b></font>), and, when her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) eyes
were withdrawn, secretly crossed his (<font color='blue'><b>Constable</b></font>) two forefingers, and exhibited them
to me, as our token that Mrs. Joe was in a cross temper. This was so
much her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) normal state, that Joe and I would often, for weeks together,
be, as to our fingers, like monumental Crusaders as to their legs.

<p/>We were to have a superb dinner, consisting of a leg of pickled pork and
greens, and a pair of roast stuffed fowls. A handsome mince-pie had
been made yesterday morning -LRB-which accounted for the mincemeat not
being missed-RRB-, and the pudding was already on the boil. These extensive
arrangements occasioned us to be cut off unceremoniously in respect of
breakfast; <div class="bookquote">``for I ain't,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Joe,--<div class="bookquote">``I ain't a going to have
no formal cramming and busting and washing up now, with what I've got
before me, I promise you!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div><p/>So, we had our slices served out, as if we were two thousand troops on a
forced march instead of a man and boy at home; and we took gulps of milk
and water, with apologetic countenances, from a jug on the dresser. In
the meantime, Mrs. Joe put clean white curtains up, and tacked a new
flowered flounce across the wide chimney to replace the old one, and
uncovered the little state parlor across the passage, which was never
uncovered at any other time, but passed the rest of the year in a cool
haze of silver paper, which even extended to the four little white
crockery poodles on the mantel-shelf, each with a black nose and a
basket of flowers in his (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) mouth, and each the counterpart of the other.
Mrs. Joe was a very clean housekeeper, but had an exquisite art of
making her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) cleanliness more uncomfortable and unacceptable than dirt
itself. Cleanliness is next to Godliness, and some people do the same by
their religion.

<p/>My sister, having so much to do, was going to church vicariously, that
is to say, Joe and I were going. In his (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) working-clothes, Joe was a
well-knit characteristic-looking blacksmith; in his (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) holiday clothes,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) was more like a scarecrow in good circumstances, than anything else.
Nothing that he (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) wore then fitted him (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) or seemed to belong to him (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>); and
everything that he (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) wore then grazed him (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>). On the present festive occasion
he (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) emerged from his (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) room, when the blithe bells were going, the picture
of misery, in a full suit of Sunday penitentials. As to me, I think my
sister must have had some general idea that I was a young offender whom
an Accoucheur Policeman had taken up -LRB-on my birthday-RRB- and delivered over
to her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>), to be dealt with according to the outraged majesty of the law.
I was always treated as if I had insisted on being born in opposition
to the dictates of reason, religion, and morality, and against the
dissuading arguments of my best friends. Even when I was taken to have
a new suit of clothes, the tailor had orders to make them like a kind of
Reformatory, and on no account to let me have the free use of my limbs.

<p/>Joe and I going to church, therefore, must have been a moving spectacle
for compassionate minds. Yet, what I suffered outside was nothing to
what I underwent within. The terrors that had assailed me whenever
Mrs. Joe had gone near the pantry, or out of the room, were only to be
equalled by the remorse with which my mind dwelt on what my hands had
done. Under the weight of my wicked secret, I pondered whether the
Church would be powerful enough to shield me from the vengeance of the
terrible young man, if I divulged to that establishment. I conceived the
idea that the time when the banns were read and when the clergyman said,
<div class="bookquote">``Ye are now to declare it!''  (<font color='red'><b>the clergyman</b></font>)</div>would be the time for me to rise and propose
a private conference in the vestry. I am far from being sure that I
might not have astonished our small congregation by resorting to this
extreme measure, but for its being Christmas Day and no Sunday.

<p/>Mr. Wopsle, the clerk at church, was to dine with us; and Mr. Hubble
the wheelwright and Mrs. Hubble; and Uncle Pumblechook -LRB-Joe's uncle,
but Mrs. Joe appropriated him (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>)-RRB-, who was a well-to-do cornchandler in
the nearest town, and drove his (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) own chaise-cart. The dinner hour was
half-past one. When Joe and I got home, we found the table laid, and
Mrs. Joe dressed, and the dinner dressing, and the front door unlocked
-LRB-it never was at any other time-RRB- for the company to enter by, and
everything most splendid. And still, not a word of the robbery.

<p/>The time came, without bringing with it any relief to my feelings, and
the company came. Mr. Wopsle, united to a Roman nose and a large shining
bald forehead, had a deep voice which he (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) was uncommonly proud of; indeed
it was understood among his (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) acquaintance that if you could only give him (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>)
his (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) head, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) would read the clergyman into fits; he (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) himself confessed
that if the Church was <div class="bookquote">``thrown open,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>meaning to competition, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) would
not despair of making his (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) mark in it. The Church not being <div class="bookquote">``thrown
open,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) was, as I have said, our clerk. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) punished the Amens
tremendously; and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) gave out the psalm,--always giving the whole
verse,--he (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) looked all round the congregation first, as much as to say,
<div class="bookquote">``You have heard my friend overhead; oblige me with your opinion of this
style!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the congregation</b></font>)</div><p/>I opened the door to the company,--making believe that it was a habit
of ours to open that door,--and I opened it first to Mr. Wopsle, next
to Mr. and Mrs. Hubble, and last of all to Uncle Pumblechook. N.B. I was
not allowed to call him (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) uncle, under the severest penalties.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Joe,''  (<font color='red'><b>Uncle</b></font>)</div>said Uncle Pumblechook, a large hard-breathing middle-aged
slow man, with a mouth like a fish, dull staring eyes, and sandy hair
standing upright on his (<font color='blue'><b>Uncle</b></font>) head, so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Uncle</b></font>) looked as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Uncle</b></font>) had just been
all but choked, and had that moment come to, <div class="bookquote">``I have brought you as the
compliments of the season--I have brought you, Mum, a bottle of sherry
wine--and I have brought you, Mum, a bottle of port wine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Every Christmas Day he (<font color='blue'><b>Uncle</b></font>) presented himself, as a profound novelty, with
exactly the same words, and carrying the two bottles like dumb-bells.
Every Christmas Day, Mrs. Joe replied, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) now replied, <div class="bookquote">``O, Un--cle
Pum-ble--chook! This is kind!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Every Christmas Day, he (<font color='blue'><b>Uncle</b></font>) retorted, as
he (<font color='blue'><b>Uncle</b></font>) now retorted, <div class="bookquote">``It's no more than your merits. And now are you all
bobbish, and how's Sixpennorth of halfpence?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>meaning me.

<p/>We dined on these occasions in the kitchen, and adjourned, for the nuts
and oranges and apples to the parlor; which was a change very like
Joe's change from his (<font color='blue'><b>Uncle</b></font>) working-clothes to his (<font color='blue'><b>Uncle</b></font>) Sunday dress. My sister was
uncommonly lively on the present occasion, and indeed was generally more
gracious in the society of Mrs. Hubble than in other company. I remember
Mrs. Hubble as a little curly sharp-edged person in sky-blue, who held a
conventionally juvenile position, because she (<font color='blue'><b>Hubble</b></font>) had married Mr. Hubble,--I
don't know at what remote period,--when she (<font color='blue'><b>Hubble</b></font>) was much younger than he (<font color='blue'><b>Hubble</b></font>). I
remember Mr Hubble as a tough, high-shouldered, stooping old man, of a
sawdusty fragrance, with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) legs extraordinarily wide apart: so that in
my short days I always saw some miles of open country between them when
I met him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) coming up the lane.

<p/>Among this good company I should have felt myself, even if I hadn't
robbed the pantry, in a false position. Not because I was squeezed in
at an acute angle of the tablecloth, with the table in my chest, and the
Pumblechookian elbow in my eye, nor because I was not allowed to speak
-LRB-I didn't want to speak-RRB-, nor because I was regaled with the scaly tips
of the drumsticks of the fowls, and with those obscure corners of pork
of which the pig, when living, had had the least reason to be vain. No;
I should not have minded that, if they would only have left me alone.
But they wouldn't leave me alone. They seemed to think the opportunity
lost, if they failed to point the conversation at me, every now and
then, and stick the point into me. I might have been an unfortunate
little bull in a Spanish arena, I got so smartingly touched up by these
moral goads.

<p/>It began the moment we sat down to dinner. Mr. Wopsle said grace with
theatrical declamation,--as it now appears to me, something like a
religious cross of the Ghost in Hamlet with Richard the Third,--and
ended with the very proper aspiration that we might be truly grateful.
Upon which my sister fixed me with her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) eye, and said, in a low
reproachful voice, <div class="bookquote">``Do you hear that? Be grateful.''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Especially,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Pumblechook/Pumblechook</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Pumblechook, <div class="bookquote">``be grateful, boy, to them which
brought you up by hand.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Pumblechook/Pumblechook</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Hubble shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Hubble</b></font>) head, and contemplating me with a mournful
presentiment that I should come to no good, asked, <div class="bookquote">``Why is it that the
young are never grateful?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>This moral mystery seemed too much for
the company until Mr. Hubble tersely solved it by saying, <div class="bookquote">``Naterally
wicious.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Hubble</b></font>)</div>Everybody then murmured <div class="bookquote">``True!''  (<font color='red'><b>Everybody</b></font>)</div>and looked at me in a
particularly unpleasant and personal manner.

<p/>Joe's station and influence were something feebler -LRB-if possible-RRB- when
there was company than when there was none. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Hubble</b></font>) always aided and
comforted me when he (<font color='blue'><b>Hubble</b></font>) could, in some way of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hubble</b></font>) own, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Hubble</b></font>) always did so
at dinner-time by giving me gravy, if there were any. There being plenty
of gravy to-day, Joe spooned into my plate, at this point, about half a
pint.

<p/>A little later on in the dinner, Mr. Wopsle reviewed the sermon with
some severity, and intimated--in the usual hypothetical case of the
Church being <div class="bookquote">``thrown open'' (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wopsle/Wopsle</b></font>)</div>--what kind of sermon he (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) would have given
them. After favoring them with some heads of that discourse, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) remarked
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) considered the subject of the day's homily, ill chosen; which
was the less excusable, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) added, when there were so many subjects
<div class="bookquote">``going about.''

 (<font color='red'><b>subjects</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``True again,''  (<font color='red'><b>Uncle</b></font>)</div>said Uncle Pumblechook. <div class="bookquote">``You've hit it, sir! Plenty of
subjects going about, for them that know how to put salt upon their
tails. That's what's wanted. A man needn't go far to find a subject,
if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s ready with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) salt-box.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Pumblechook/Pumblechook</b></font>)</div>Mr. Pumblechook added, after a short
interval of reflection, <div class="bookquote">``Look at Pork alone. There's a subject! If you
want a subject, look at Pork!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Pumblechook/Pumblechook</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``True, sir. Many a moral for the young,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wopsle/Wopsle</b></font>)</div>returned Mr. Wopsle,--and I
knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) was going to lug me in, before he (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) said it; <div class="bookquote">``might be deduced
from that text.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>-LRB-<div class="bookquote">``You listen to this,''  (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div>said my sister to me, in a severe parenthesis.-RRB-

<p/>Joe gave me some more gravy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Swine,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wopsle/Wopsle</b></font>)</div>pursued Mr. Wopsle, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) deepest voice, and pointing his (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) fork
at my blushes, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) were mentioning my Christian name,--<div class="bookquote">``swine were
the companions of the prodigal. The gluttony of Swine is put before us,
as an example to the young.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>-LRB-I thought this pretty well in him (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) who
had been praising up the pork for being so plump and juicy.-RRB- <div class="bookquote">``What is
detestable in a pig is more detestable in a boy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Or girl,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Hubble</b></font>)</div>suggested Mr. Hubble.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course, or girl, Mr. Hubble,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wopsle/Wopsle</b></font>)</div>assented Mr. Wopsle, rather irritably,
<div class="bookquote">``but there is no girl present.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wopsle/Wopsle</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Besides,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Pumblechook/Pumblechook</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Pumblechook, turning sharp on me, <div class="bookquote">``think what you've
got to be grateful for. If you'd been born a Squeaker--''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Hubble</b></font>) was, if ever a child was,''  (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div>said my sister, most emphatically.

<p/>Joe gave me some more gravy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, but I mean a four-footed Squeaker,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Pumblechook/Pumblechook</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Pumblechook. <div class="bookquote">``If you
had been born such, would you have been here now? Not you--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wopsle/Wopsle</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Unless in that form,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wopsle/Wopsle</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Wopsle, nodding towards the dish.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But I don't mean in that form, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Pumblechook/Pumblechook</b></font>)</div>returned Mr. Pumblechook, who had
an objection to being interrupted; <div class="bookquote">``I mean, enjoying himself with his (<font color='blue'><b>Hubble</b></font>)
elders and betters, and improving himself with their conversation, and
rolling in the lap of luxury. Would he (<font color='blue'><b>Hubble</b></font>) have been doing that? No, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hubble</b></font>)
wouldn't. And what would have been your destination?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Pumblechook/Pumblechook</b></font>)</div>turning on me
again. <div class="bookquote">``You would have been disposed of for so many shillings according
to the market price of the article, and Dunstable the butcher would have
come up to you as you lay in your straw, and he (<font color='blue'><b>butcher</b></font>) would have whipped you
under his (<font color='blue'><b>butcher</b></font>) left arm, and with his (<font color='blue'><b>butcher</b></font>) right he (<font color='blue'><b>butcher</b></font>) would have tucked up his (<font color='blue'><b>butcher</b></font>) frock
to get a penknife from out of his (<font color='blue'><b>butcher</b></font>) waistcoat-pocket, and he (<font color='blue'><b>butcher</b></font>) would have
shed your blood and had your life. No bringing up by hand then. Not a
bit of it!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div><p/>Joe offered me more gravy, which I was afraid to take.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>butcher</b></font>) was a world of trouble to you, ma’am,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Hubble</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Hubble,
commiserating my sister.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Trouble?''  (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div>echoed my sister; <div class="bookquote">``trouble?''  (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div>and then entered on a fearful
catalogue of all the illnesses I had been guilty of, and all the acts
of sleeplessness I had committed, and all the high places I had tumbled
from, and all the low places I had tumbled into, and all the injuries I
had done myself, and all the times she (<font color='blue'><b>Hubble</b></font>) had wished me in my grave, and I
had contumaciously refused to go there.

<p/>I think the Romans must have aggravated one another very much, with
their noses. Perhaps, they became the restless people they were, in
consequence. Anyhow, Mr. Wopsle's Roman nose so aggravated me, during
the recital of my misdemeanours, that I should have liked to pull it
until he (<font color='blue'><b>Roman</b></font>) howled. But, all I had endured up to this time was nothing in
comparison with the awful feelings that took possession of me when the
pause was broken which ensued upon my sister's recital, and in which
pause everybody had looked at me -LRB-as I felt painfully conscious-RRB- with
indignation and abhorrence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yet,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Pumblechook/Pumblechook</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Pumblechook, leading the company gently back to the
theme from which they had strayed, <div class="bookquote">``Pork--regarded as biled--is rich,
too; ain't it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Pumblechook/Pumblechook</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Have a little brandy, uncle,''  (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div>said my sister.

<p/>O Heavens, it had come at last! He (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) would find it was weak, he (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) would say
it was weak, and I was lost! I held tight to the leg of the table under
the cloth, with both hands, and awaited my fate.

<p/>My sister went for the stone bottle, came back with the stone bottle,
and poured his (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) brandy out: no one else taking any. The wretched man
trifled with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) glass,--took it up, looked at it through the light,
put it down,--prolonged my misery. All this time Mrs. Joe and Joe were
briskly clearing the table for the pie and pudding.

<p/>I couldn't keep my eyes off him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). Always holding tight by the leg of the
table with my hands and feet, I saw the miserable creature finger his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
glass playfully, take it up, smile, throw his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head back, and drink
the brandy off. Instantly afterwards, the company were seized with
unspeakable consternation, owing to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) springing to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) feet, turning
round several times in an appalling spasmodic whooping-cough dance,
and rushing out at the door; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) then became visible through the window,
violently plunging and expectorating, making the most hideous faces, and
apparently out of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mind.

<p/>I held on tight, while Mrs. Joe and Joe ran to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). I didn't know how
I had done it, but I had no doubt I had murdered him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) somehow. In my
dreadful situation, it was a relief when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was brought back, and
surveying the company all round as if they had disagreed with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), sank
down into his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) chair with the one significant gasp, <div class="bookquote">``Tar!''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>I had filled up the bottle from the tar-water jug. I knew he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would be
worse by and by. I moved the table, like a Medium of the present day, by
the vigor of my unseen hold upon it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tar!''  (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div>cried my sister, in amazement. <div class="bookquote">``Why, how ever could Tar come
there?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Uncle Pumblechook/Pumblechook</b></font>)</div><p/>But, Uncle Pumblechook, who was omnipotent in that kitchen, wouldn't
hear the word, wouldn't hear of the subject, imperiously waved it all
away with his (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) hand, and asked for hot gin and water. My sister, who had
begun to be alarmingly meditative, had to employ herself actively in
getting the gin, the hot water, the sugar, and the lemon-peel, and mixing
them. For the time being at least, I was saved. I still held on to the
leg of the table, but clutched it now with the fervor of gratitude.

<p/>By degrees, I became calm enough to release my grasp and partake of
pudding. Mr. Pumblechook partook of pudding. All partook of pudding.
The course terminated, and Mr. Pumblechook had begun to beam under the
genial influence of gin and water. I began to think I should get over
the day, when my sister said to Joe, <div class="bookquote">``Clean plates,--cold.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div><p/>I clutched the leg of the table again immediately, and pressed it to my
bosom as if it had been the companion of my youth and friend of my soul.
I foresaw what was coming, and I felt that this time I really was gone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You must taste,''  (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div>said my sister, addressing the guests with her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) best
grace--<div class="bookquote">``you must taste, to finish with, such a delightful and delicious
present of Uncle Pumblechook's!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the guests</b></font>)</div><p/>Must they! Let them not hope to taste it!

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You must know,''  (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div>said my sister, rising, <div class="bookquote">``it's a pie; a savory pork
pie.''

 (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div><p/>The company murmured their compliments. Uncle Pumblechook, sensible of
having deserved well of his (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) fellow-creatures, said,--quite vivaciously,
all things considered,--<div class="bookquote">``Well, Mrs. Joe, we'll do our best endeavors;
let us have a cut at this same pie.''

 (<font color='red'><b>fellow-creatures</b></font>)</div><p/>My sister went out to get it. I heard her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) steps proceed to the pantry. I
saw Mr. Pumblechook balance his (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) knife. I saw reawakening appetite in the
Roman nostrils of Mr. Wopsle. I heard Mr. Hubble remark that <div class="bookquote">``a bit of
savory pork pie would lay atop of anything you could mention, and do
no harm,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Hubble</b></font>)</div>and I heard Joe say, <div class="bookquote">``You shall have some, Pip.''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>I have never
been absolutely certain whether I uttered a shrill yell of terror,
merely in spirit, or in the bodily hearing of the company. I felt that I
could bear no more, and that I must run away. I released the leg of the
table, and ran for my life.

<p/>But I ran no farther than the house door, for there I ran head-foremost
into a party of soldiers with their muskets, one of whom held out a pair
of handcuffs to me, saying, <div class="bookquote">``Here you are, look sharp, come on!''




 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>Chapter V

<p/>The apparition of a file of soldiers ringing down the but-ends of their
loaded muskets on our door-step, caused the dinner-party to rise
from table in confusion, and caused Mrs. Joe re-entering the kitchen
empty-handed, to stop short and stare, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) wondering lament of
<div class="bookquote">``Gracious goodness gracious me, what's gone--with the--pie!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div><p/>The sergeant and I were in the kitchen when Mrs. Joe stood staring;
at which crisis I partially recovered the use of my senses. It was
the sergeant who had spoken to me, and he (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) was now looking round at the
company, with his (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) handcuffs invitingly extended towards them in his (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>)
right hand, and his (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) left on my shoulder.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Excuse me, ladies and gentleman,''  (<font color='red'><b>the sergeant</b></font>)</div>said the sergeant, <div class="bookquote">``but as I have
mentioned at the door to this smart young shaver,''  (<font color='red'><b>the sergeant</b></font>)</div>-LRB-which he (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) hadn't-RRB-, <div class="bookquote">``I
am on a chase in the name of the king, and I want the blacksmith.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And pray what might you want with him (<font color='blue'><b>blacksmith</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div>retorted my sister, quick to
resent his (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) being wanted at all.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Missis,''  (<font color='red'><b>the sergeant</b></font>)</div>returned the gallant sergeant, <div class="bookquote">``speaking for myself, I should
reply, the honor and pleasure of his (<font color='blue'><b>blacksmith</b></font>) fine wife's acquaintance; speaking
for the king, I answer, a little job done.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the sergeant</b></font>)</div><p/>This was received as rather neat in the sergeant; insomuch that Mr.
Pumblechook cried audibly, <div class="bookquote">``Good again!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Pumblechook/Pumblechook</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You see, blacksmith,''  (<font color='red'><b>the sergeant</b></font>)</div>said the sergeant, who had by this time picked
out Joe with his (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) eye, <div class="bookquote">``we have had an accident with these, and I find
the lock of one of `em goes wrong, and the coupling don't act pretty.
As they are wanted for immediate service, will you throw your eye over
them?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div><p/>Joe threw his (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) eye over them, and pronounced that the job would
necessitate the lighting of his (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) forge fire, and would take nearer
two hours than one. <div class="bookquote">``Will it? Then will you set about it at once,
blacksmith?''  (<font color='red'><b>the sergeant</b></font>)</div>said the off-hand sergeant, <div class="bookquote">``as it's on his (<font color='blue'><b>blacksmith</b></font>) Majesty's
service. And if my men can bear a hand anywhere, they'll make themselves
useful.''  (<font color='red'><b>the sergeant</b></font>)</div>With that, he (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) called to his (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) men, who came trooping into the
kitchen one after another, and piled their arms in a corner. And then
they stood about, as soldiers do; now, with their hands loosely clasped
before them; now, resting a knee or a shoulder; now, easing a belt or a
pouch; now, opening the door to spit stiffly over their high stocks, out
into the yard.

<p/>All these things I saw without then knowing that I saw them, for I
was in an agony of apprehension. But beginning to perceive that the
handcuffs were not for me, and that the military had so far got the
better of the pie as to put it in the background, I collected a little
more of my scattered wits.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Would you give me the time?''  (<font color='red'><b>the sergeant</b></font>)</div>said the sergeant, addressing himself to
Mr. Pumblechook, as to a man whose appreciative powers justified the
inference that he (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) was equal to the time.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's just gone half past two.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's not so bad,''  (<font color='red'><b>the sergeant</b></font>)</div>said the sergeant, reflecting; <div class="bookquote">``even if I was
forced to halt here nigh two hours, that'll do. How far might you call
yourselves from the marshes, hereabouts? Not above a mile, I reckon?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the sergeant</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Just a mile,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Joe.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That'll do. We begin to close in upon `em about dusk. A little before
dusk, my orders are. That'll do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Convicts, sergeant?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wopsle/Wopsle</b></font>)</div>asked Mr. Wopsle, in a matter-of-course way.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay!''  (<font color='red'><b>the sergeant</b></font>)</div>returned the sergeant, <div class="bookquote">``two. They're pretty well known to be out
on the marshes still, and they won't try to get clear of `em before
dusk. Anybody here seen anything of any such game?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the sergeant</b></font>)</div><p/>Everybody, myself excepted, said no, with confidence. Nobody thought of
me.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well!''  (<font color='red'><b>the sergeant</b></font>)</div>said the sergeant, <div class="bookquote">``they'll find themselves trapped in a circle,
I expect, sooner than they count on. Now, blacksmith! If you're ready,
his (<font color='blue'><b>blacksmith</b></font>) Majesty the King is.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the sergeant</b></font>)</div><p/>Joe had got his (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) coat and waistcoat and cravat off, and his (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) leather apron
on, and passed into the forge. One of the soldiers opened its wooden
windows, another lighted the fire, another turned to at the bellows, the
rest stood round the blaze, which was soon roaring. Then Joe began to
hammer and clink, hammer and clink, and we all looked on.

<p/>The interest of the impending pursuit not only absorbed the general
attention, but even made my sister liberal. She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) drew a pitcher of beer
from the cask for the soldiers, and invited the sergeant to take a glass
of brandy. But Mr. Pumblechook said, sharply, <div class="bookquote">``Give him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) wine, Mum. I'll
engage there's no tar in that:''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Pumblechook/Pumblechook</b></font>)</div>so, the sergeant thanked him (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) and said
that as he (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) preferred his (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) drink without tar, he (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) would take wine, if it
was equally convenient. When it was given him (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) drank his (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) Majesty's
health and compliments of the season, and took it all at a mouthful and
smacked his (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) lips.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good stuff, eh, sergeant?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Pumblechook/Pumblechook</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Pumblechook.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll tell you something,''  (<font color='red'><b>the sergeant</b></font>)</div>returned the sergeant; <div class="bookquote">``I suspect that
stuff's of your providing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the sergeant</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Pumblechook, with a fat sort of laugh, said, <div class="bookquote">``Ay, ay? Why?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Pumblechook/Pumblechook</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because,''  (<font color='red'><b>the sergeant</b></font>)</div>returned the sergeant, clapping him (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) on the shoulder, <div class="bookquote">``you're
a man that knows what's what.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``D’ye think so?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Pumblechook/Pumblechook</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Pumblechook, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) former laugh. <div class="bookquote">``Have
another glass!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``With you. Hob and nob,''  (<font color='red'><b>the sergeant</b></font>)</div>returned the sergeant. <div class="bookquote">``The top of mine to the
foot of yours,--the foot of yours to the top of mine,--Ring once, ring
twice,--the best tune on the Musical Glasses! Your health. May you live
a thousand years, and never be a worse judge of the right sort than you
are at the present moment of your life!''

 (<font color='red'><b>The sergeant</b></font>)</div><p/>The sergeant tossed off his (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) glass again and seemed quite ready for
another glass. I noticed that Mr. Pumblechook in his (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) hospitality
appeared to forget that he (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) had made a present of the wine, but took the
bottle from Mrs. Joe and had all the credit of handing it about in a
gush of joviality. Even I got some. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) was so very free of the wine
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) even called for the other bottle, and handed that about with the
same liberality, when the first was gone.

<p/>As I watched them while they all stood clustering about the forge,
enjoying themselves so much, I thought what terrible good sauce for
a dinner my fugitive friend on the marshes was. They had not enjoyed
themselves a quarter so much, before the entertainment was brightened
with the excitement he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) furnished. And now, when they were all in lively
anticipation of <div class="bookquote">``the two villains''  (<font color='red'><b>the fugitives</b></font>)</div>being taken, and when the bellows
seemed to roar for the fugitives, the fire to flare for them, the smoke
to hurry away in pursuit of them, Joe to hammer and clink for them,
and all the murky shadows on the wall to shake at them in menace as the
blaze rose and sank, and the red-hot sparks dropped and died, the pale
afternoon outside almost seemed in my pitying young fancy to have turned
pale on their account, poor wretches.

<p/>At last, Joe's job was done, and the ringing and roaring stopped. As Joe
got on his (<font color='blue'><b>fugitives</b></font>) coat, he (<font color='blue'><b>fugitives</b></font>) mustered courage to propose that some of us should
go down with the soldiers and see what came of the hunt. Mr. Pumblechook
and Mr. Hubble declined, on the plea of a pipe and ladies' society; but
Mr. Wopsle said he (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) would go, if Joe would. Joe said he (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) was agreeable,
and would take me, if Mrs. Joe approved. We never should have got leave
to go, I am sure, but for Mrs. Joe's curiosity to know all about it and
how it ended. As it was, she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) merely stipulated, <div class="bookquote">``If you bring the boy
back with his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) head blown to bits by a musket, don't look to me to put it
together again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>The sergeant took a polite leave of the ladies, and parted from Mr.
Pumblechook as from a comrade; though I doubt if he (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) were quite as fully
sensible of that gentleman's merits under arid conditions, as when
something moist was going. His (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) men resumed their muskets and fell in.
Mr. Wopsle, Joe, and I, received strict charge to keep in the rear, and
to speak no word after we reached the marshes. When we were all out in
the raw air and were steadily moving towards our business, I treasonably
whispered to Joe, <div class="bookquote">``I hope, Joe, we shan't find them.''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>and Joe whispered
to me, <div class="bookquote">``I'd give a shilling if they had cut and run, Pip.''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>We were joined by no stragglers from the village, for the weather was
cold and threatening, the way dreary, the footing bad, darkness coming
on, and the people had good fires in-doors and were keeping the day. A
few faces hurried to glowing windows and looked after us, but none came
out. We passed the finger-post, and held straight on to the churchyard.
There we were stopped a few minutes by a signal from the sergeant's
hand, while two or three of his (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) men dispersed themselves among the
graves, and also examined the porch. They came in again without finding
anything, and then we struck out on the open marshes, through the gate
at the side of the churchyard. A bitter sleet came rattling against us
here on the east wind, and Joe took me on his (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) back.

<p/>Now that we were out upon the dismal wilderness where they little
thought I had been within eight or nine hours and had seen both men
hiding, I considered for the first time, with great dread, if we should
come upon them, would my particular convict suppose that it was I who
had brought the soldiers there? He (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) had asked me if I was a deceiving
imp, and he (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) had said I should be a fierce young hound if I joined the
hunt against him (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>). Would he (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) believe that I was both imp and hound in
treacherous earnest, and had betrayed him (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>)?

<p/>It was of no use asking myself this question now. There I was, on Joe's
back, and there was Joe beneath me, charging at the ditches like a
hunter, and stimulating Mr. Wopsle not to tumble on his (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) Roman nose, and
to keep up with us. The soldiers were in front of us, extending into a
pretty wide line with an interval between man and man. We were taking
the course I had begun with, and from which I had diverged in the mist.
Either the mist was not out again yet, or the wind had dispelled it.
Under the low red glare of sunset, the beacon, and the gibbet, and the
mound of the Battery, and the opposite shore of the river, were plain,
though all of a watery lead color.

<p/>With my heart thumping like a blacksmith at Joe's broad shoulder, I
looked all about for any sign of the convicts. I could see none, I could
hear none. Mr. Wopsle had greatly alarmed me more than once, by his (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>)
blowing and hard breathing; but I knew the sounds by this time, and
could dissociate them from the object of pursuit. I got a dreadful
start, when I thought I heard the file still going; but it was only a
sheep-bell. The sheep stopped in their eating and looked timidly at
us; and the cattle, their heads turned from the wind and sleet, stared
angrily as if they held us responsible for both annoyances; but, except
these things, and the shudder of the dying day in every blade of grass,
there was no break in the bleak stillness of the marshes.

<p/>The soldiers were moving on in the direction of the old Battery, and we
were moving on a little way behind them, when, all of a sudden, we all
stopped. For there had reached us on the wings of the wind and rain, a
long shout. It was repeated. It was at a distance towards the east, but
it was long and loud. Nay, there seemed to be two or more shouts raised
together,--if one might judge from a confusion in the sound.

<p/>To this effect the sergeant and the nearest men were speaking under
their breath, when Joe and I came up. After another moment's listening,
Joe -LRB-who was a good judge-RRB- agreed, and Mr. Wopsle -LRB-who was a bad judge-RRB-
agreed. The sergeant, a decisive man, ordered that the sound should not
be answered, but that the course should be changed, and that his (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) men
should make towards it <div class="bookquote">``at the double.''  (<font color='red'><b>men</b></font>)</div>So we slanted to the right
-LRB-where the East was-RRB-, and Joe pounded away so wonderfully, that I had to
hold on tight to keep my seat.

<p/>It was a run indeed now, and what Joe called, in the only two words he (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>)
spoke all the time, <div class="bookquote">``a Winder.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Down banks and up banks, and over gates,
and splashing into dikes, and breaking among coarse rushes: no man cared
where he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) went. As we came nearer to the shouting, it became more and
more apparent that it was made by more than one voice. Sometimes, it
seemed to stop altogether, and then the soldiers stopped. When it broke
out again, the soldiers made for it at a greater rate than ever, and we
after them. After a while, we had so run it down, that we could hear one
voice calling <div class="bookquote">``Murder!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>and another voice, <div class="bookquote">``Convicts! Runaways! Guard!
This way for the runaway convicts!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Then both voices would seem to be
stifled in a struggle, and then would break out again. And when it had
come to this, the soldiers ran like deer, and Joe too.

<p/>The sergeant ran in first, when we had run the noise quite down, and two
of his (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) men ran in close upon him (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>). Their pieces were cocked and levelled
when we all ran in.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here are both men!''  (<font color='red'><b>the sergeant</b></font>)</div>panted the sergeant, struggling at the bottom of a
ditch. <div class="bookquote">``Surrender, you two! and confound you for two wild beasts! Come
asunder!''

 (<font color='red'><b>some men</b></font>)</div><p/>Water was splashing, and mud was flying, and oaths were being sworn, and
blows were being struck, when some more men went down into the ditch to
help the sergeant, and dragged out, separately, my convict and the other
one. Both were bleeding and panting and execrating and struggling; but
of course I knew them both directly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mind!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said my convict, wiping blood from his (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) face with his (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) ragged
sleeves, and shaking torn hair from his (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) fingers: <div class="bookquote">``I took him (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>)! I give him (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>)
up to you! Mind that!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's not much to be particular about,''  (<font color='red'><b>the sergeant</b></font>)</div>said the sergeant; <div class="bookquote">``it'll do you
small good, my man, being in the same plight yourself. Handcuffs there!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the sergeant</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't expect it to do me any good. I don't want it to do me more good
than it does now,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said my convict, with a greedy laugh. <div class="bookquote">``I took him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
knows it. That's enough for me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The other convict was livid to look at, and, in addition to the old
bruised left side of his (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) face, seemed to be bruised and torn all over.
He (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) could not so much as get his (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) breath to speak, until they were both
separately handcuffed, but leaned upon a soldier to keep himself from
falling.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Take notice, guard,--he (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) tried to murder me,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>were his (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) first words.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tried to murder him (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said my convict, disdainfully. <div class="bookquote">``Try, and not
do it? I took him (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>), and giv' him (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) up; that's what I done. I not only
prevented him (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) getting off the marshes, but I dragged him (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) here,--dragged
him (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) this far on his (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) way back. He (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>)'s a gentleman, if you please, this
villain. Now, the Hulks has got its gentleman again, through me. Murder
him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)? Worth my while, too, to murder him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>), when I could do worse and drag
him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) back!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The other one still gasped, <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) tried--he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) tried-to--murder me.
Bear--bear witness.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Lookee here!''  (<font color='red'><b>the sergeant</b></font>)</div>said my convict to the sergeant. <div class="bookquote">``Single-handed I got
clear of the prison-ship; I made a dash and I done it. I could ha' got
clear of these death-cold flats likewise--look at my leg: you won't find
much iron on it--if I hadn't made the discovery that he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was here. Let
him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) go free? Let him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) profit by the means as I found out? Let him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) make a
tool of me afresh and again? Once more? No, no, no. If I had died at
the bottom there,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) made an emphatic swing at the ditch with his (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>)
manacled hands, <div class="bookquote">``I'd have held to him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) with that grip, that you should
have been safe to find him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) in my hold.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The other fugitive, who was evidently in extreme horror of his (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>)
companion, repeated, <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) tried to murder me. I should have been a dead
man if you had not come up.''

 (<font color='red'><b>companion</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lies!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said my convict, with fierce energy. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s a liar born, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'ll die a liar. Look at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face; ain't it written there? Let him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) turn
those eyes of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) on me. I defy him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to do it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the soldiers</b></font>)</div><p/>The other, with an effort at a scornful smile, which could not, however,
collect the nervous working of his (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) mouth into any set expression, looked
at the soldiers, and looked about at the marshes and at the sky, but
certainly did not look at the speaker.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you see him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>pursued my convict. <div class="bookquote">``Do you see what a villain he (<font color='blue'><b>villain</b></font>) is?
Do you see those grovelling and wandering eyes? That's how he (<font color='blue'><b>villain</b></font>) looked
when we were tried together. He (<font color='blue'><b>villain</b></font>) never looked at me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>The other, always working and working his (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) dry lips and turning his (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) eyes
restlessly about him (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) far and near, did at last turn them for a moment on
the speaker, with the words, <div class="bookquote">``You are not much to look at,''  (<font color='red'><b>the speaker</b></font>)</div>and with
a half-taunting glance at the bound hands. At that point, my convict
became so frantically exasperated, that he (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) would have rushed upon him (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>)
but for the interposition of the soldiers. <div class="bookquote">``Didn't I tell you,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the
other convict then, <div class="bookquote">``that he (<font color='blue'><b>villain</b></font>) would murder me, if he (<font color='blue'><b>villain</b></font>) could?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And any one
could see that he (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) shook with fear, and that there broke out upon his (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>)
lips curious white flakes, like thin snow.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Enough of this parley,''  (<font color='red'><b>the sergeant</b></font>)</div>said the sergeant. <div class="bookquote">``Light those torches.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the soldiers</b></font>)</div><p/>As one of the soldiers, who carried a basket in lieu of a gun, went down
on his (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) knee to open it, my convict looked round him (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) for the first time,
and saw me. I had alighted from Joe's back on the brink of the ditch
when we came up, and had not moved since. I looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) eagerly when
he (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) looked at me, and slightly moved my hands and shook my head. I had
been waiting for him (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) to see me that I might try to assure him (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) of my
innocence. It was not at all expressed to me that he (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) even comprehended
my intention, for he (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) gave me a look that I did not understand, and it
all passed in a moment. But if he (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) had looked at me for an hour or for
a day, I could not have remembered his (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) face ever afterwards, as having
been more attentive.

<p/>The soldier with the basket soon got a light, and lighted three or four
torches, and took one himself and distributed the others. It had been
almost dark before, but now it seemed quite dark, and soon afterwards
very dark. Before we departed from that spot, four soldiers standing in
a ring, fired twice into the air. Presently we saw other torches kindled
at some distance behind us, and others on the marshes on the opposite
bank of the river. <div class="bookquote">``All right,''  (<font color='red'><b>the sergeant</b></font>)</div>said the sergeant. <div class="bookquote">``March.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>We had not gone far when three cannon were fired ahead of us with a
sound that seemed to burst something inside my ear. <div class="bookquote">``You are expected
on board,''  (<font color='red'><b>the sergeant</b></font>)</div>said the sergeant to my convict; <div class="bookquote">``they know you are coming.
Don't straggle, my man. Close up here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the sergeant</b></font>)</div><p/>The two were kept apart, and each walked surrounded by a separate guard.
I had hold of Joe's hand now, and Joe carried one of the torches. Mr.
Wopsle had been for going back, but Joe was resolved to see it out, so
we went on with the party. There was a reasonably good path now, mostly
on the edge of the river, with a divergence here and there where a dike
came, with a miniature windmill on it and a muddy sluice-gate. When
I looked round, I could see the other lights coming in after us. The
torches we carried dropped great blotches of fire upon the track, and
I could see those, too, lying smoking and flaring. I could see nothing
else but black darkness. Our lights warmed the air about us with their
pitchy blaze, and the two prisoners seemed rather to like that, as they
limped along in the midst of the muskets. We could not go fast, because
of their lameness; and they were so spent, that two or three times we
had to halt while they rested.

<p/>After an hour or so of this travelling, we came to a rough wooden hut
and a landing-place. There was a guard in the hut, and they challenged,
and the sergeant answered. Then, we went into the hut, where there was
a smell of tobacco and whitewash, and a bright fire, and a lamp, and
a stand of muskets, and a drum, and a low wooden bedstead, like an
overgrown mangle without the machinery, capable of holding about a dozen
soldiers all at once. Three or four soldiers who lay upon it in their
great-coats were not much interested in us, but just lifted their heads
and took a sleepy stare, and then lay down again. The sergeant made some
kind of report, and some entry in a book, and then the convict whom I
call the other convict was drafted off with his (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) guard, to go on board
first.

<p/>My convict never looked at me, except that once. While we stood in the
hut, he (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) stood before the fire looking thoughtfully at it, or putting up
his (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) feet by turns upon the hob, and looking thoughtfully at them as if
he (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) pitied them for their recent adventures. Suddenly, he (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) turned to the
sergeant, and remarked,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish to say something respecting this escape. It may prevent some
persons laying under suspicion alonger me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the sergeant</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You can say what you like,''  (<font color='red'><b>the sergeant</b></font>)</div>returned the sergeant, standing coolly
looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) arms folded, <div class="bookquote">``but you have no call to say it
here. You'll have opportunity enough to say about it, and hear about it,
before it's done with, you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know, but this is another pint, a separate matter. A man can't
starve; at least I can't. I took some wittles, up at the willage over
yonder,--where the church stands a'most out on the marshes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You mean stole,''  (<font color='red'><b>the sergeant</b></font>)</div>said the sergeant.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And I'll tell you where from. From the blacksmith's.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Halloa!''  (<font color='red'><b>the sergeant</b></font>)</div>said the sergeant, staring at Joe.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Halloa, Pip!''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>said Joe, staring at me.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It was some broken wittles--that's what it was--and a dram of liquor,
and a pie.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you happened to miss such an article as a pie, blacksmith?''  (<font color='red'><b>the sergeant</b></font>)</div>asked
the sergeant, confidentially.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My wife did, at the very moment when you came in. Don't you know, Pip?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>said my convict, turning his (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) eyes on Joe in a moody manner, and
without the least glance at me,--<div class="bookquote">``so you're the blacksmith, are you?
Than I'm sorry to say, I've eat your pie.''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``God knows you're welcome to it,--so far as it was ever mine,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>returned
Joe, with a saving remembrance of Mrs. Joe. <div class="bookquote">``We don't know what you have
done, but we wouldn't have you starved to death for it, poor miserable
fellow-creatur.--Would us, Pip?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>The something that I had noticed before, clicked in the man's throat
again, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) turned his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) back. The boat had returned, and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) guard were
ready, so we followed him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to the landing-place made of rough stakes
and stones, and saw him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) put into the boat, which was rowed by a crew of
convicts like himself. No one seemed surprised to see him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), or interested
in seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), or glad to see him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), or sorry to see him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), or spoke a word,
except that somebody in the boat growled as if to dogs, <div class="bookquote">``Give way,
you!''  (<font color='red'><b>that somebody</b></font>)</div>which was the signal for the dip of the oars. By the light of the
torches, we saw the black Hulk lying out a little way from the mud of
the shore, like a wicked Noah's ark. Cribbed and barred and moored by
massive rusty chains, the prison-ship seemed in my young eyes to be
ironed like the prisoners. We saw the boat go alongside, and we saw
him (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) taken up the side and disappear. Then, the ends of the torches were
flung hissing into the water, and went out, as if it were all over with
him (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>).




<p/>Chapter VI

<p/>My state of mind regarding the pilfering from which I had been so
unexpectedly exonerated did not impel me to frank disclosure; but I hope
it had some dregs of good at the bottom of it.

<p/>I do not recall that I felt any tenderness of conscience in reference
to Mrs. Joe, when the fear of being found out was lifted off me. But
I loved Joe,--perhaps for no better reason in those early days than
because the dear fellow let me love him (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>),--and, as to him (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>), my inner self
was not so easily composed. It was much upon my mind -LRB-particularly when
I first saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) looking about for his (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) file-RRB- that I ought to tell Joe the
whole truth. Yet I did not, and for the reason that I mistrusted that
if I did, he (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) would think me worse than I was. The fear of losing Joe's
confidence, and of thenceforth sitting in the chimney corner at night
staring drearily at my forever lost companion and friend, tied up my
tongue. I morbidly represented to myself that if Joe knew it, I never
afterwards could see him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) at the fireside feeling his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) fair whisker,
without thinking that he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) was meditating on it. That, if Joe knew it, I
never afterwards could see him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) glance, however casually, at yesterday's
meat or pudding when it came on to-day's table, without thinking that he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)
was debating whether I had been in the pantry. That, if Joe knew it, and
at any subsequent period of our joint domestic life remarked that his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)
beer was flat or thick, the conviction that he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) suspected tar in it,
would bring a rush of blood to my face. In a word, I was too cowardly
to do what I knew to be right, as I had been too cowardly to avoid doing
what I knew to be wrong. I had had no intercourse with the world at
that time, and I imitated none of its many inhabitants who act in this
manner. Quite an untaught genius, I made the discovery of the line of
action for myself.

<p/>As I was sleepy before we were far away from the prison-ship, Joe took
me on his (<font color='blue'><b>genius</b></font>) back again and carried me home. He (<font color='blue'><b>genius</b></font>) must have had a tiresome
journey of it, for Mr. Wopsle, being knocked up, was in such a very bad
temper that if the Church had been thrown open, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) would probably have
excommunicated the whole expedition, beginning with Joe and myself. In
his (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) lay capacity, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) persisted in sitting down in the damp to such
an insane extent, that when his (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) coat was taken off to be dried at the
kitchen fire, the circumstantial evidence on his (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) trousers would have
hanged him (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>), if it had been a capital offence.

<p/>By that time, I was staggering on the kitchen floor like a little
drunkard, through having been newly set upon my feet, and through having
been fast asleep, and through waking in the heat and lights and noise of
tongues. As I came to myself -LRB-with the aid of a heavy thump between the
shoulders, and the restorative exclamation <div class="bookquote">``Yah! Was there ever such
a boy as this!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>from my sister,-RRB- I found Joe telling them about the
convict's confession, and all the visitors suggesting different ways
by which he (<font color='blue'><b>drunkard</b></font>) had got into the pantry. Mr. Pumblechook made out, after
carefully surveying the premises, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) had first got upon the roof of
the forge, and had then got upon the roof of the house, and had then let
himself down the kitchen chimney by a rope made of his (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) bedding cut
into strips; and as Mr. Pumblechook was very positive and drove his (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>)
own chaise-cart--over everybody--it was agreed that it must be so. Mr.
Wopsle, indeed, wildly cried out, <div class="bookquote">``No!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wopsle/Wopsle</b></font>)</div>with the feeble malice of a
tired man; but, as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had no theory, and no coat on, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was unanimously
set at naught,--not to mention his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) smoking hard behind, as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stood
with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) back to the kitchen fire to draw the damp out: which was not
calculated to inspire confidence.

<p/>This was all I heard that night before my sister clutched me, as a
slumberous offence to the company's eyesight, and assisted me up to bed
with such a strong hand that I seemed to have fifty boots on, and to be
dangling them all against the edges of the stairs. My state of mind, as
I have described it, began before I was up in the morning, and lasted
long after the subject had died out, and had ceased to be mentioned
saving on exceptional occasions.




<p/>Chapter VII

<p/>At the time when I stood in the churchyard reading the family
tombstones, I had just enough learning to be able to spell them out. My
construction even of their simple meaning was not very correct, for I
read <div class="bookquote">``wife of the Above''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>as a complimentary reference to my father's
exaltation to a better world; and if any one of my deceased relations
had been referred to as <div class="bookquote">``Below,''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>I have no doubt I should have formed
the worst opinions of that member of the family. Neither were my notions
of the theological positions to which my Catechism bound me, at
all accurate; for, I have a lively remembrance that I supposed my
declaration that I was to <div class="bookquote">``walk in the same all the days of my life,''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>laid me under an obligation always to go through the village from our
house in one particular direction, and never to vary it by turning down
by the wheelwright's or up by the mill.

<p/>When I was old enough, I was to be apprenticed to Joe, and until I could
assume that dignity I was not to be what Mrs. Joe called <div class="bookquote">``Pompeyed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>or
-LRB-as I render it-RRB- pampered. Therefore, I was not only odd-boy about the
forge, but if any neighbor happened to want an extra boy to frighten
birds, or pick up stones, or do any such job, I was favored with the
employment. In order, however, that our superior position might not be
compromised thereby, a money-box was kept on the kitchen mantel-shelf,
into which it was publicly made known that all my earnings were
dropped. I have an impression that they were to be contributed
eventually towards the liquidation of the National Debt, but I know I
had no hope of any personal participation in the treasure.

<p/>Mr. Wopsle's great-aunt kept an evening school in the village; that is
to say, she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) was a ridiculous old woman of limited means and unlimited
infirmity, who used to go to sleep from six to seven every evening, in
the society of youth who paid two pence per week each, for the improving
opportunity of seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) do it. She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) rented a small cottage, and Mr.
Wopsle had the room upstairs, where we students used to overhear him (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>)
reading aloud in a most dignified and terrific manner, and occasionally
bumping on the ceiling. There was a fiction that Mr. Wopsle <div class="bookquote">``examined''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wopsle/Wopsle</b></font>)</div>the scholars once a quarter. What he (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) did on those occasions was to turn
up his (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) cuffs, stick up his (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) hair, and give us Mark Antony's oration over
the body of Caesar. This was always followed by Collins's Ode on
the Passions, wherein I particularly venerated Mr. Wopsle as Revenge
throwing his (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) blood-stained sword in thunder down, and taking the
War-denouncing trumpet with a withering look. It was not with me then,
as it was in later life, when I fell into the society of the Passions,
and compared them with Collins and Wopsle, rather to the disadvantage of
both gentlemen.

<p/>Mr. Wopsle's great-aunt, besides keeping this Educational Institution,
kept in the same room--a little general shop. She (<font color='blue'><b>great-aunt</b></font>) had no idea what stock
she (<font color='blue'><b>great-aunt</b></font>) had, or what the price of anything in it was; but there was a little
greasy memorandum-book kept in a drawer, which served as a Catalogue
of Prices, and by this oracle Biddy arranged all the shop transactions.
Biddy was Mr. Wopsle's great-aunt's granddaughter; I confess myself
quite unequal to the working out of the problem, what relation she (<font color='blue'><b>granddaughter</b></font>) was
to Mr. Wopsle. She (<font color='blue'><b>granddaughter</b></font>) was an orphan like myself; like me, too, had been
brought up by hand. She (<font color='blue'><b>granddaughter</b></font>) was most noticeable, I thought, in respect of
her (<font color='blue'><b>granddaughter</b></font>) extremities; for, her (<font color='blue'><b>granddaughter</b></font>) hair always wanted brushing, her (<font color='blue'><b>granddaughter</b></font>) hands always
wanted washing, and her (<font color='blue'><b>granddaughter</b></font>) shoes always wanted mending and pulling up at
heel. This description must be received with a week-day limitation. On
Sundays, she (<font color='blue'><b>granddaughter</b></font>) went to church elaborated.

<p/>Much of my unassisted self, and more by the help of Biddy than of Mr.
Wopsle's great-aunt, I struggled through the alphabet as if it had been
a bramble-bush; getting considerably worried and scratched by every
letter. After that I fell among those thieves, the nine figures, who
seemed every evening to do something new to disguise themselves and
baffle recognition. But, at last I began, in a purblind groping way, to
read, write, and cipher, on the very smallest scale.

<p/>One night I was sitting in the chimney corner with my slate, expending
great efforts on the production of a letter to Joe. I think it must have
been a full year after our hunt upon the marshes, for it was a long
time after, and it was winter and a hard frost. With an alphabet on the
hearth at my feet for reference, I contrived in an hour or two to print
and smear this epistle:--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``MI DEER JO i OPE U R KRWITE WELL i OPE i SHAL SON B HABELL 4 2 TEEDGE
U JO AN THEN WE SHORL B SO GLODD AN WEN i M PRENGTD 2 U JO WOT LARX AN
BLEVE ME INF XN PIP.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>There was no indispensable necessity for my communicating with Joe by
letter, inasmuch as he (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) sat beside me and we were alone. But I delivered
this written communication -LRB-slate and all-RRB- with my own hand, and Joe
received it as a miracle of erudition.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I say, Pip, old chap!''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>cried Joe, opening his (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) blue eyes wide, <div class="bookquote">``what a
scholar you are! An't you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should like to be,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, glancing at the slate as he (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) held it; with
a misgiving that the writing was rather hilly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, here's a J,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>said Joe, <div class="bookquote">``and a O equal to anythink! Here's a J and
a O, Pip, and a J-O, Joe.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div><p/>I had never heard Joe read aloud to any greater extent than this
monosyllable, and I had observed at church last Sunday, when I
accidentally held our Prayer-Book upside down, that it seemed to suit
his (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) convenience quite as well as if it had been all right. Wishing to
embrace the present occasion of finding out whether in teaching Joe, I
should have to begin quite at the beginning, I said, <div class="bookquote">``Ah! But read the
rest, Jo.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The rest, eh, Pip?''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>said Joe, looking at it with a slow, searching eye,
<div class="bookquote">``One, two, three. Why, here's three Js, and three Os, and three J-O,
Joes in it, Pip!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div><p/>I leaned over Joe, and, with the aid of my forefinger read him (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) the whole
letter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Astonishing!''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>said Joe, when I had finished. <div class="bookquote">``You ARE a scholar.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How do you spell Gargery, Joe?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked him (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>), with a modest patronage.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't spell it at all,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>said Joe.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But supposing you did?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It can't be supposed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>said Joe. <div class="bookquote">``Tho' I'm uncommon fond of reading,
too.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you, Joe?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``On-common. Give me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>said Joe, <div class="bookquote">``a good book, or a good newspaper, and
sit me down afore a good fire, and I ask no better. Lord!''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) continued,
after rubbing his (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) knees a little, <div class="bookquote">``when you do come to a J and a O, and
says you, `Here, at last, is a J-O, Joe,' how interesting reading is!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>I derived from this, that Joe's education, like Steam, was yet in its
infancy. Pursuing the subject, I inquired,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Didn't you ever go to school, Joe, when you were as little as me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, Pip.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why didn't you ever go to school, Joe, when you were as little as me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, Pip,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>said Joe, taking up the poker, and settling himself to
his (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) usual occupation when he (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) was thoughtful, of slowly raking the fire
between the lower bars; <div class="bookquote">``I'll tell you. My father, Pip, he (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) were given
to drink, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) were overtook with drink, he (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) hammered away at
my mother, most onmerciful. It were a'most the only hammering he (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) did,
indeed, `xcepting at myself. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) hammered at me with a wigor only
to be equalled by the wigor with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) didn't hammer at his (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>)
anwil.--You're a listening and understanding, Pip?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Joe.''

 (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div><p/>```Consequence, my mother and me we ran away from my father several
times; and then my mother she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'d go out to work, and she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'d say, <div class="bookquote">``Joe,''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'d say, <div class="bookquote">``now, please God, you shall have some schooling, child,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and
she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'d put me to school. But my father were that good in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) hart that
he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) couldn't abear to be without us. So, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)'d come with a most tremenjous
crowd and make such a row at the doors of the houses where we was, that
they used to be obligated to have no more to do with us and to give us
up to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). And then he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) took us home and hammered us. Which, you see,
Pip,'' said Joe, pausing in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) meditative raking of the fire, and
looking at me, <div class="bookquote">``were a drawback on my learning.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Pip</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly, poor Joe!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Though mind you, Pip,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>said Joe, with a judicial touch or two of the
poker on the top bar, <div class="bookquote">``rendering unto all their doo, and maintaining
equal justice betwixt man and man, my father were that good in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) hart,
don't you see?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div><p/>I didn't see; but I didn't say so.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well!''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>Joe pursued, <div class="bookquote">``somebody must keep the pot a biling, Pip, or the
pot won't bile, don't you know?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div><p/>I saw that, and said so.

<p/>```Consequence, my father didn't make objections to my going to work; so
I went to work at my present calling, which were his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) too, if he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
would have followed it, and I worked tolerable hard, I assure you, Pip.
In time I were able to keep him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), and I kep him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) till he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) went off in a
purple leptic fit. And it were my intentions to have had put upon his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
tombstone that, Whatsume’er the failings on his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) part, Remember reader he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
were that good in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) heart.''

<p/>Joe recited this couplet with such manifest pride and careful
perspicuity, that I asked him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had made it himself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I made it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>said Joe, <div class="bookquote">``my own self. I made it in a moment. It was like
striking out a horseshoe complete, in a single blow. I never was so much
surprised in all my life,--couldn't credit my own ed,--to tell you the
truth, hardly believed it were my own ed. As I was saying, Pip, it were
my intentions to have had it cut over him (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>); but poetry costs money, cut
it how you will, small or large, and it were not done. Not to mention
bearers, all the money that could be spared were wanted for my mother.
She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) were in poor elth, and quite broke. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) weren't long of following,
poor soul, and her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) share of peace come round at last.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div><p/>Joe's blue eyes turned a little watery; he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) rubbed first one of them, and
then the other, in a most uncongenial and uncomfortable manner, with the
round knob on the top of the poker.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It were but lonesome then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>said Joe, <div class="bookquote">``living here alone, and I got
acquainted with your sister. Now, Pip,'' (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>--Joe looked firmly at me as
if he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) knew I was not going to agree with him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>);--<div class="bookquote">``your sister is a fine
figure of a woman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>I could not help looking at the fire, in an obvious state of doubt.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Whatever family opinions, or whatever the world's opinions, on that
subject may be, Pip, your sister is,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>Joe tapped the top bar with the
poker after every word following, <div class="bookquote">``a-fine-figure--of--a--woman!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div><p/>I could think of nothing better to say than <div class="bookquote">``I am glad you think so,
Joe.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So am I,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>returned Joe, catching me up. <div class="bookquote">``I am glad I think so, Pip. A
little redness or a little matter of Bone, here or there, what does it
signify to Me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I sagaciously observed, if it didn't signify to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), to whom did it
signify?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly!''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>assented Joe. <div class="bookquote">``That's it. You're right, old chap! When I
got acquainted with your sister, it were the talk how she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) was bringing
you up by hand. Very kind of her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) too, all the folks said, and I said,
along with all the folks. As to you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>Joe pursued with a countenance
expressive of seeing something very nasty indeed, <div class="bookquote">``if you could have
been aware how small and flabby and mean you was, dear me, you'd have
formed the most contemptible opinion of yourself!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div><p/>Not exactly relishing this, I said, <div class="bookquote">``Never mind me, Joe.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I did mind you, Pip,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) returned with tender simplicity. ``When
I offered to your sister to keep company, and to be asked in church at
such times as she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) was willing and ready to come to the forge, I said to
her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>), `And bring the poor little child. God bless the poor little child,'
I said to your sister, `there's room for him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) at the forge!'''

<p/>I broke out crying and begging pardon, and hugged Joe round the neck:
who dropped the poker to hug me, and to say, <div class="bookquote">``Ever the best of friends;
an't us, Pip? Don't cry, old chap!''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>When this little interruption was over, Joe resumed:--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, you see, Pip, and here we are! That's about where it lights; here
we are! Now, when you take me in hand in my learning, Pip -LRB-and I tell
you beforehand I am awful dull, most awful dull-RRB-, Mrs. Joe mustn't see
too much of what we're up to. It must be done, as I may say, on the sly.
And why on the sly? I'll tell you why, Pip.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had taken up the poker again; without which, I doubt if he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) could have
proceeded in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) demonstration.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your sister is given to government.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Given to government, Joe?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I was startled, for I had some shadowy idea
-LRB-and I am afraid I must add, hope-RRB- that Joe had divorced her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) in a favor
of the Lords of the Admiralty, or Treasury.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Given to government,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>said Joe. <div class="bookquote">``Which I meantersay the government of
you and myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) an't over partial to having scholars on the premises,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>Joe
continued, <div class="bookquote">``and in partickler would not be over partial to my being a
scholar, for fear as I might rise. Like a sort of rebel, don't you see?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div><p/>I was going to retort with an inquiry, and had got as far as <div class="bookquote">``Why--''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>when Joe stopped me.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Stay a bit. I know what you're a going to say, Pip; stay a bit! I don't
deny that your sister comes the Mo-gul over us, now and again. I don't
deny that she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) do throw us back-falls, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) do drop down upon us
heavy. At such times as when your sister is on the Ram-page, Pip,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>Joe
sank his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) voice to a whisper and glanced at the door, <div class="bookquote">``candor compels fur
to admit that she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) is a Buster.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div><p/>Joe pronounced this word, as if it began with at least twelve capital
Bs.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why don't I rise? That were your observation when I broke it off, Pip?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Joe.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>said Joe, passing the poker in to his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) left hand, that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) might
feel his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) whisker; and I had no hope of him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) took to that
placid occupation; <div class="bookquote">``your sister's a master-mind. A master-mind.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What's that?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked, in some hope of bringing him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) to a stand. But
Joe was readier with his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) definition than I had expected, and completely
stopped me by arguing circularly, and answering with a fixed look,
<div class="bookquote">``Her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And I ain't a master-mind,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>Joe resumed, when he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had unfixed his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) look,
and got back to his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) whisker. <div class="bookquote">``And last of all, Pip,--and this I want to
say very serious to you, old chap,--I see so much in my poor mother,
of a woman drudging and slaving and breaking her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) honest hart and never
getting no peace in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) mortal days, that I'm dead afeerd of going wrong
in the way of not doing what's right by a woman, and I'd fur rather
of the two go wrong the t'other way, and be a little ill-conwenienced
myself. I wish it was only me that got put out, Pip; I wish there warn't
no Tickler for you, old chap; I wish I could take it all on myself;
but this is the up-and-down-and-straight on it, Pip, and I hope you'll
overlook shortcomings.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Young</b></font>)</div><p/>Young as I was, I believe that I dated a new admiration of Joe from that
night. We were equals afterwards, as we had been before; but, afterwards
at quiet times when I sat looking at Joe and thinking about him (<font color='blue'><b>Young</b></font>), I had
a new sensation of feeling conscious that I was looking up to Joe in my
heart.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``However,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>said Joe, rising to replenish the fire; <div class="bookquote">``here's the
Dutch-clock a working himself up to being equal to strike Eight of `em,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>himself</b></font>)'s not come home yet! I hope Uncle Pumblechook's mare mayn't have
set a forefoot on a piece o' ice, and gone down.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Joe made occasional trips with Uncle Pumblechook on market-days,
to assist him (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) in buying such household stuffs and goods as required a
woman's judgment; Uncle Pumblechook being a bachelor and reposing no
confidences in his (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) domestic servant. This was market-day, and Mrs. Joe
was out on one of these expeditions.

<p/>Joe made the fire and swept the hearth, and then we went to the door to
listen for the chaise-cart. It was a dry cold night, and the wind blew
keenly, and the frost was white and hard. A man would die to-night of
lying out on the marshes, I thought. And then I looked at the stars, and
considered how awful it would be for a man to turn his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face up to them
as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) froze to death, and see no help or pity in all the glittering
multitude.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here comes the mare,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>said Joe, <div class="bookquote">``ringing like a peal of bells!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div><p/>The sound of her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) iron shoes upon the hard road was quite musical, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>)
came along at a much brisker trot than usual. We got a chair out, ready
for Mrs. Joe's alighting, and stirred up the fire that they might see a
bright window, and took a final survey of the kitchen that nothing might
be out of its place. When we had completed these preparations, they
drove up, wrapped to the eyes. Mrs. Joe was soon landed, and Uncle
Pumblechook was soon down too, covering the mare with a cloth, and we
were soon all in the kitchen, carrying so much cold air in with us that
it seemed to drive all the heat out of the fire.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Joe, unwrapping herself with haste and excitement, and
throwing her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) bonnet back on her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) shoulders where it hung by the strings,
<div class="bookquote">``if this boy ain't grateful this night, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) never will be!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div><p/>I looked as grateful as any boy possibly could, who was wholly
uninformed why he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) ought to assume that expression.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's only to be hoped,''  (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div>said my sister, <div class="bookquote">``that he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) won't be Pompeyed. But
I have my fears.''

 (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) ain't in that line, Mum,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Pumblechook/Pumblechook</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Pumblechook. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Mum</b></font>) knows better.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)? I looked at Joe, making the motion with my lips and eyebrows,
<div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Mum</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>Joe looked at me, making the motion with his (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) lips and eyebrows,
<div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Mum</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>My sister catching him (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) in the act, he (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) drew the back of his (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) hand
across his (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) nose with his (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) usual conciliatory air on such occasions, and
looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well?''  (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div>said my sister, in her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) snappish way. <div class="bookquote">``What are you staring at?
Is the house afire?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``--Which some individual,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>Joe politely hinted, <div class="bookquote">``mentioned--she (<font color='blue'><b>Mum</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And she (<font color='blue'><b>Mum</b></font>) is a she (<font color='blue'><b>Mum</b></font>), I suppose?''  (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div>said my sister. <div class="bookquote">``Unless you call Miss
Havisham a he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>). And I doubt if even you'll go so far as that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Havisham, up town?''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>said Joe.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is there any Miss Havisham down town?''  (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div>returned my sister.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Mum</b></font>) wants this boy to go and play there. And of course he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)'s going. And
he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had better play there,''  (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div>said my sister, shaking her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) head at me as an
encouragement to be extremely light and sportive, <div class="bookquote">``or I'll work him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>I had heard of Miss Havisham up town,--everybody for miles round had
heard of Miss Havisham up town,--as an immensely rich and grim lady who
lived in a large and dismal house barricaded against robbers, and who
led a life of seclusion.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well to be sure!''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>said Joe, astounded. <div class="bookquote">``I wonder how she (<font color='blue'><b>Mum</b></font>) come to know
Pip!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Noodle!''  (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div>cried my sister. <div class="bookquote">``Who said she (<font color='blue'><b>Mum</b></font>) knew him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``--Which some individual,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>Joe again politely hinted, <div class="bookquote">``mentioned that

 (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And couldn't she (<font color='blue'><b>Mum</b></font>) ask Uncle Pumblechook if he (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) knew of a boy to go and

a tenant of hers, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) may sometimes--we won't say quarterly
or half-yearly, for that would be requiring too much of you--but
sometimes--go there to pay his (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) rent? And couldn't she (<font color='blue'><b>Mum</b></font>) then ask Uncle
Pumblechook if he (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) knew of a boy to go and play there? And couldn't Uncle
Pumblechook, being always considerate and thoughtful for us--though you
may not think it, Joseph,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>in a tone of the deepest reproach, as if
he (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) were the most callous of nephews, <div class="bookquote">``then mention this boy, standing

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good again!''  (<font color='red'><b>Uncle</b></font>)</div>cried Uncle Pumblechook. <div class="bookquote">``Well put! Prettily pointed! Good

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, Joseph,''  (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div>said my sister, still in a reproachful manner, while Joe
apologetically drew the back of his (<font color='blue'><b>Uncle</b></font>) hand across and across his (<font color='blue'><b>Uncle</b></font>) nose,
<div class="bookquote">``you do not yet--though you may not think it--know the case. You may

to take him (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) into town to-night in his (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) own chaise-cart, and to keep
him (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) to-night, and to take him (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) own hands to Miss Havisham's
to-morrow morning. And Lor-a-mussy me!''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>cried my sister, casting off her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)
bonnet in sudden desperation, <div class="bookquote">``here I stand talking to mere Mooncalfs,
with Uncle Pumblechook waiting, and the mare catching cold at the door,
and the boy grimed with crock and dirt from the hair of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) head to the
sole of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) foot!''

 (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div><p/>With that, she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) pounced upon me, like an eagle on a lamb, and my face was
squeezed into wooden bowls in sinks, and my head was put under taps of
water-butts, and I was soaped, and kneaded, and towelled, and thumped,
and harrowed, and rasped, until I really was quite beside myself. -LRB-I
may here remark that I suppose myself to be better acquainted than
any living authority, with the ridgy effect of a wedding-ring, passing
unsympathetically over the human countenance.-RRB-

<p/>When my ablutions were completed, I was put into clean linen of the
stiffest character, like a young penitent into sackcloth, and was
trussed up in my tightest and fearfullest suit. I was then delivered
over to Mr. Pumblechook, who formally received me as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) were the
Sheriff, and who let off upon me the speech that I knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) had been
dying to make all along: <div class="bookquote">``Boy, be forever grateful to all friends, but
especially unto them which brought you up by hand!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good-bye, Joe!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``God bless you, Pip, old chap!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I had never parted from him (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) before, and what with my feelings and what
with soapsuds, I could at first see no stars from the chaise-cart.
But they twinkled out one by one, without throwing any light on the
questions why on earth I was going to play at Miss Havisham's, and what
on earth I was expected to play at.




<p/>Chapter VIII

<p/>Mr. Pumblechook's premises in the High Street of the market town,
were of a peppercorny and farinaceous character, as the premises of a
cornchandler and seedsman should be. It appeared to me that he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) must be a
very happy man indeed, to have so many little drawers in his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) shop; and
I wondered when I peeped into one or two on the lower tiers, and saw the
tied-up brown paper packets inside, whether the flower-seeds and bulbs
ever wanted of a fine day to break out of those jails, and bloom.

<p/>It was in the early morning after my arrival that I entertained this
speculation. On the previous night, I had been sent straight to bed in
an attic with a sloping roof, which was so low in the corner where the
bedstead was, that I calculated the tiles as being within a foot of my
eyebrows. In the same early morning, I discovered a singular affinity
between seeds and corduroys. Mr. Pumblechook wore corduroys, and so did
his (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) shopman; and somehow, there was a general air and flavor about the
corduroys, so much in the nature of seeds, and a general air and flavor
about the seeds, so much in the nature of corduroys, that I hardly knew
which was which. The same opportunity served me for noticing that Mr.
Pumblechook appeared to conduct his (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) business by looking across the
street at the saddler, who appeared to transact his (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) business by keeping
his (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) eye on the coachmaker, who appeared to get on in life by putting his (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>)
hands in his (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) pockets and contemplating the baker, who in his (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) turn folded
his (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) arms and stared at the grocer, who stood at his (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) door and yawned at
the chemist. The watchmaker, always poring over a little desk with
a magnifying-glass at his (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) eye, and always inspected by a group of
smock-frocks poring over him (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) through the glass of his (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) shop-window,
seemed to be about the only person in the High Street whose trade
engaged his (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) attention.

<p/>Mr. Pumblechook and I breakfasted at eight o’clock in the parlor behind
the shop, while the shopman took his (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) mug of tea and hunch of bread
and butter on a sack of peas in the front premises. I considered Mr.
Pumblechook wretched company. Besides being possessed by my sister's
idea that a mortifying and penitential character ought to be imparted
to my diet,--besides giving me as much crumb as possible in combination
with as little butter, and putting such a quantity of warm water into
my milk that it would have been more candid to have left the milk out
altogether,--his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) conversation consisted of nothing but arithmetic. On
my politely bidding him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) Good morning, he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) said, pompously, <div class="bookquote">``Seven times
nine, boy?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And how should I be able to answer, dodged in that way, in
a strange place, on an empty stomach! I was hungry, but before I had
swallowed a morsel, he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) began a running sum that lasted all through the
breakfast. <div class="bookquote">``Seven?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``And four?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``And eight?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``And six?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``And two?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``And
ten?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>And so on. And after each figure was disposed of, it was as much
as I could do to get a bite or a sup, before the next came; while he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) sat
at his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) ease guessing nothing, and eating bacon and hot roll, in -LRB-if I
may be allowed the expression-RRB- a gorging and gormandizing manner.

<p/>For such reasons, I was very glad when ten o’clock came and we started
for Miss Havisham's; though I was not at all at my ease regarding the
manner in which I should acquit myself under that lady's roof. Within
a quarter of an hour we came to Miss Havisham's house, which was of old
brick, and dismal, and had a great many iron bars to it. Some of the
windows had been walled up; of those that remained, all the lower were
rustily barred. There was a courtyard in front, and that was barred; so
we had to wait, after ringing the bell, until some one should come
to open it. While we waited at the gate, I peeped in -LRB-even then Mr.
Pumblechook said, <div class="bookquote">``And fourteen?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Pumblechook/Pumblechook</b></font>)</div>but I pretended not to hear him (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>)-RRB-, and
saw that at the side of the house there was a large brewery. No brewing
was going on in it, and none seemed to have gone on for a long long
time.

<p/>A window was raised, and a clear voice demanded <div class="bookquote">``What name?''  (<font color='red'><b>conductor</b></font>)</div>To which my
conductor replied, <div class="bookquote">``Pumblechook.''  (<font color='red'><b>conductor</b></font>)</div>The voice returned, <div class="bookquote">``Quite right,''  (<font color='red'><b>a lady</b></font>)</div>and
the window was shut again, and a young lady came across the court-yard,
with keys in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Pumblechook/Pumblechook</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Pumblechook, <div class="bookquote">``is Pip.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Pumblechook/Pumblechook</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``This is Pip, is it?''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>returned the young lady, who was very pretty and
seemed very proud; <div class="bookquote">``come in, Pip.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Pumblechook was coming in also, when she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) stopped him (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) with the gate.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Did you wish to see Miss Havisham?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If Miss Havisham wished to see me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Pumblechook/Pumblechook</b></font>)</div>returned Mr. Pumblechook,
discomfited.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah!''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>said the girl; <div class="bookquote">``but you see she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) don't.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) said it so finally, and in such an undiscussible way, that Mr.
Pumblechook, though in a condition of ruffled dignity, could not
protest. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) eyed me severely,--as if I had done anything to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>)!--and departed with the words reproachfully delivered: <div class="bookquote">``Boy! Let
your behavior here be a credit unto them which brought you up by hand!''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I was not free from apprehension that he (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) would come back to propound
through the gate, <div class="bookquote">``And sixteen?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) didn't.

<p/>My young conductress locked the gate, and we went across the courtyard.
It was paved and clean, but grass was growing in every crevice. The
brewery buildings had a little lane of communication with it, and the
wooden gates of that lane stood open, and all the brewery beyond stood
open, away to the high enclosing wall; and all was empty and disused.
The cold wind seemed to blow colder there than outside the gate; and
it made a shrill noise in howling in and out at the open sides of the
brewery, like the noise of wind in the rigging of a ship at sea.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) saw me looking at it, and she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``You could drink without hurt
all the strong beer that's brewed there now, boy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should think I could, miss,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, in a shy way.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Better not try to brew beer there now, or it would turn out sour, boy;
don't you think so?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It looks like it, miss.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not that anybody means to try,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``for that's all done with,
and the place will stand as idle as it is till it falls. As to strong
beer, there's enough of it in the cellars already, to drown the Manor
House.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is that the name of this house, miss?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``One of its names, boy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It has more than one, then, miss?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``One more. Its other name was Satis; which is Greek, or Latin, or
Hebrew, or all three--or all one to me--for enough.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Enough House,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I; <div class="bookquote">``that's a curious name, miss.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) replied; <div class="bookquote">``but it meant more than it said. It meant, when it
was given, that whoever had this house could want nothing else. They
must have been easily satisfied in those days, I should think. But don't
loiter, boy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Though she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) called me <div class="bookquote">``boy''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>so often, and with a carelessness that was
far from complimentary, she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) was of about my own age. She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) seemed much
older than I, of course, being a girl, and beautiful and self-possessed;
and she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) was as scornful of me as if she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) had been one-and-twenty, and a
queen.

<p/>We went into the house by a side door, the great front entrance had two
chains across it outside,--and the first thing I noticed was, that the
passages were all dark, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) had left a candle burning there.
She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) took it up, and we went through more passages and up a staircase,
and still it was all dark, and only the candle lighted us.

<p/>At last we came to the door of a room, and she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Go in.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>I answered, more in shyness than politeness, <div class="bookquote">``After you, miss.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>To this she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) returned: <div class="bookquote">``Don't be ridiculous, boy; I am not going in.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And
scornfully walked away, and--what was worse--took the candle with her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>).

<p/>This was very uncomfortable, and I was half afraid. However, the only
thing to be done being to knock at the door, I knocked, and was told
from within to enter. I entered, therefore, and found myself in a pretty
large room, well lighted with wax candles. No glimpse of daylight was to
be seen in it. It was a dressing-room, as I supposed from the furniture,
though much of it was of forms and uses then quite unknown to me. But
prominent in it was a draped table with a gilded looking-glass, and that
I made out at first sight to be a fine lady's dressing-table.

<p/>Whether I should have made out this object so soon if there had been no
fine lady sitting at it, I cannot say. In an arm-chair, with an
elbow resting on the table and her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) head leaning on that hand, sat the
strangest lady I have ever seen, or shall ever see.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was dressed in rich materials,--satins, and lace, and silks,--all
of white. Her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) shoes were white. And she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had a long white veil dependent
from her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) hair, and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had bridal flowers in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) hair, but her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) hair was
white. Some bright jewels sparkled on her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) neck and on her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) hands, and
some other jewels lay sparkling on the table. Dresses, less splendid
than the dress she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) wore, and half-packed trunks, were scattered about.
She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had not quite finished dressing, for she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had but one shoe on,--the
other was on the table near her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) hand,--her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) veil was but half arranged,
her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) watch and chain were not put on, and some lace for her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) bosom lay
with those trinkets, and with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) handkerchief, and gloves, and
some flowers, and a Prayer-Book all confusedly heaped about the
looking-glass.

<p/>It was not in the first few moments that I saw all these things, though
I saw more of them in the first moments than might be supposed. But I
saw that everything within my view which ought to be white, had been
white long ago, and had lost its lustre and was faded and yellow. I saw
that the bride within the bridal dress had withered like the dress, and
like the flowers, and had no brightness left but the brightness of her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>)
sunken eyes. I saw that the dress had been put upon the rounded figure
of a young woman, and that the figure upon which it now hung loose had
shrunk to skin and bone. Once, I had been taken to see some ghastly
waxwork at the Fair, representing I know not what impossible personage
lying in state. Once, I had been taken to one of our old marsh churches
to see a skeleton in the ashes of a rich dress that had been dug out of
a vault under the church pavement. Now, waxwork and skeleton seemed to
have dark eyes that moved and looked at me. I should have cried out, if
I could.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who is it?''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>said the lady at the table.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Pip, ma’am.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pip?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Pumblechook's boy, ma’am. Come--to play.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Come nearer; let me look at you. Come close.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>It was when I stood before her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), avoiding her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) eyes, that I took note of
the surrounding objects in detail, and saw that her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) watch had stopped
at twenty minutes to nine, and that a clock in the room had stopped at
twenty minutes to nine.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Look at me,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Miss Havisham. <div class="bookquote">``You are not afraid of a woman who has
never seen the sun since you were born?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I regret to state that I was not afraid of telling the enormous lie
comprehended in the answer <div class="bookquote">``No.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you know what I touch here?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said, laying her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) hands, one upon
the other, on her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) left side.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, ma’am.''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>-LRB-It made me think of the young man.-RRB-

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What do I touch?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Your heart.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Broken!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) uttered the word with an eager look, and with strong emphasis, and
with a weird smile that had a kind of boast in it. Afterwards she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) kept
her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) hands there for a little while, and slowly took them away as if they
were heavy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am tired,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Miss Havisham. <div class="bookquote">``I want diversion, and I have done
with men and women. Play.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I think it will be conceded by my most disputatious reader, that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
could hardly have directed an unfortunate boy to do anything in the wide
world more difficult to be done under the circumstances.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I sometimes have sick fancies,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) went on, <div class="bookquote">``and I have a sick fancy
that I want to see some play. There, there!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>with an impatient movement
of the fingers of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) right hand; <div class="bookquote">``play, play, play!''

 (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div><p/>For a moment, with the fear of my sister's working me before my eyes, I
had a desperate idea of starting round the room in the assumed character
of Mr. Pumblechook's chaise-cart. But I felt myself so unequal to the
performance that I gave it up, and stood looking at Miss Havisham in
what I suppose she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) took for a dogged manner, inasmuch as she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said, when
we had taken a good look at each other,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you sullen and obstinate?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, ma’am, I am very sorry for you, and very sorry I can't play just
now. If you complain of me I shall get into trouble with my sister, so
I would do it if I could; but it's so new here, and so strange, and so
fine,--and melancholy--.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I stopped, fearing I might say too much, or
had already said it, and we took another look at each other.

<p/>Before she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) spoke again, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) turned her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) eyes from me, and looked at the
dress she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) wore, and at the dressing-table, and finally at herself in the
looking-glass.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So new to him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) muttered, <div class="bookquote">``so old to me; so strange to him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), so
familiar to me; so melancholy to both of us! Call Estella.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>As she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was still looking at the reflection of herself, I thought she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was
still talking to herself, and kept quiet.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Call Estella,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) repeated, flashing a look at me. <div class="bookquote">``You can do that.
Call Estella. At the door.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Estella/Miss Estella/ESTELLA</b></font>)</div><p/>To stand in the dark in a mysterious passage of an unknown house,
bawling Estella to a scornful young lady neither visible nor responsive,
and feeling it a dreadful liberty so to roar out her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) name, was almost
as bad as playing to order. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) answered at last, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) light came
along the dark passage like a star.

<p/>Miss Havisham beckoned her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) to come close, and took up a jewel from the
table, and tried its effect upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) fair young bosom and against her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>)
pretty brown hair. <div class="bookquote">``Your own, one day, my dear, and you will use it
well. Let me see you play cards with this boy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``With this boy? Why, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) is a common laboring boy!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I thought I overheard Miss Havisham answer,--only it seemed so
unlikely,--<div class="bookquote">``Well? You can break his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) heart.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you play, boy?''  (<font color='red'><b>Estella/Miss Estella/ESTELLA</b></font>)</div>asked Estella of myself, with the greatest
disdain.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing but beggar my neighbor, miss.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Beggar him (<font color='blue'><b>Beggar</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Havisham</b></font>)</div>said Miss Havisham to Estella. So we sat down to cards.

<p/>It was then I began to understand that everything in the room had
stopped, like the watch and the clock, a long time ago. I noticed that
Miss Havisham put down the jewel exactly on the spot from which she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) had
taken it up. As Estella dealt the cards, I glanced at the dressing-table
again, and saw that the shoe upon it, once white, now yellow, had never
been worn. I glanced down at the foot from which the shoe was absent,
and saw that the silk stocking on it, once white, now yellow, had been
trodden ragged. Without this arrest of everything, this standing still
of all the pale decayed objects, not even the withered bridal dress on
the collapsed form could have looked so like grave-clothes, or the long
veil so like a shroud.

<p/>So she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) sat, corpse-like, as we played at cards; the frillings and
trimmings on her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) bridal dress, looking like earthy paper. I knew nothing
then of the discoveries that are occasionally made of bodies buried in
ancient times, which fall to powder in the moment of being distinctly
seen; but, I have often thought since, that she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) must have looked as if
the admission of the natural light of day would have struck her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) to dust.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Beggar</b></font>) calls the knaves Jacks, this boy!''  (<font color='red'><b>Estella/Miss Estella/ESTELLA</b></font>)</div>said Estella with disdain, before
our first game was out. <div class="bookquote">``And what coarse hands he (<font color='blue'><b>Beggar</b></font>) has! And what thick
boots!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I had never thought of being ashamed of my hands before; but I began
to consider them a very indifferent pair. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) contempt for me was so
strong, that it became infectious, and I caught it.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) won the game, and I dealt. I misdealt, as was only natural, when I
knew she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) was lying in wait for me to do wrong; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) denounced me for
a stupid, clumsy laboring-boy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You say nothing of her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>remarked Miss Havisham to me, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) looked
on. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) says many hard things of you, but you say nothing of her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>). What
do you think of her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't like to say,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I stammered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell me in my ear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Havisham</b></font>)</div>said Miss Havisham, bending down.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) is very proud,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I replied, in a whisper.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Anything else?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) is very pretty.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Anything else?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) is very insulting.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>-LRB-She (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) was looking at me then with a look
of supreme aversion.-RRB-

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Anything else?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think I should like to go home.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And never see her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) again, though she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) is so pretty?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not sure that I shouldn't like to see her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) again, but I should like
to go home now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You shall go soon,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Havisham</b></font>)</div>said Miss Havisham, aloud. <div class="bookquote">``Play the game out.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Saving for the one weird smile at first, I should have felt almost
sure that Miss Havisham's face could not smile. It had dropped into a
watchful and brooding expression,--most likely when all the things about
her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) had become transfixed,--and it looked as if nothing could ever lift
it up again. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) chest had dropped, so that she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) stooped; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) voice
had dropped, so that she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) spoke low, and with a dead lull upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>);
altogether, she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) had the appearance of having dropped body and soul,
within and without, under the weight of a crushing blow.

<p/>I played the game to an end with Estella, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) beggared me. She (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>)
threw the cards down on the table when she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) had won them all, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>)
despised them for having been won of me.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``When shall I have you here again?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Miss Havisham. <div class="bookquote">``Let me think.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I was beginning to remind her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) that to-day was Wednesday, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>)
checked me with her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) former impatient movement of the fingers of her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>)
right hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There, there! I know nothing of days of the week; I know nothing of
weeks of the year. Come again after six days. You hear?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, ma’am.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Estella, take him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) down. Let him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) have something to eat, and let him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) roam
and look about him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) while he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) eats. Go, Pip.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I followed the candle down, as I had followed the candle up, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>)
stood it in the place where we had found it. Until she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) opened the
side entrance, I had fancied, without thinking about it, that it must
necessarily be night-time. The rush of the daylight quite confounded me,
and made me feel as if I had been in the candlelight of the strange room
many hours.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are to wait here, you boy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Estella/Miss Estella/ESTELLA</b></font>)</div>said Estella; and disappeared and
closed the door.

<p/>I took the opportunity of being alone in the courtyard to look at my
coarse hands and my common boots. My opinion of those accessories was
not favorable. They had never troubled me before, but they troubled
me now, as vulgar appendages. I determined to ask Joe why he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) had ever
taught me to call those picture-cards Jacks, which ought to be called
knaves. I wished Joe had been rather more genteelly brought up, and then
I should have been so too.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) came back, with some bread and meat and a little mug of beer. She (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>)
put the mug down on the stones of the yard, and gave me the bread
and meat without looking at me, as insolently as if I were a dog in
disgrace. I was so humiliated, hurt, spurned, offended, angry, sorry,--I
cannot hit upon the right name for the smart--God knows what its name
was,--that tears started to my eyes. The moment they sprang there, the
girl looked at me with a quick delight in having been the cause of them.
This gave me power to keep them back and to look at her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>): so, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) gave a
contemptuous toss--but with a sense, I thought, of having made too sure
that I was so wounded--and left me.

<p/>But when she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was gone, I looked about me for a place to hide my face
in, and got behind one of the gates in the brewery-lane, and leaned my
sleeve against the wall there, and leaned my forehead on it and cried.
As I cried, I kicked the wall, and took a hard twist at my hair; so
bitter were my feelings, and so sharp was the smart without a name, that
needed counteraction.

<p/>My sister's bringing up had made me sensitive. In the little world in
which children have their existence whosoever brings them up, there is
nothing so finely perceived and so finely felt as injustice. It may be
only small injustice that the child can be exposed to; but the child
is small, and its world is small, and its rocking-horse stands as many
hands high, according to scale, as a big-boned Irish hunter. Within
myself, I had sustained, from my babyhood, a perpetual conflict with
injustice. I had known, from the time when I could speak, that my
sister, in her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) capricious and violent coercion, was unjust to me. I had
cherished a profound conviction that her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) bringing me up by hand gave her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)
no right to bring me up by jerks. Through all my punishments, disgraces,
fasts, and vigils, and other penitential performances, I had nursed
this assurance; and to my communing so much with it, in a solitary and
unprotected way, I in great part refer the fact that I was morally timid
and very sensitive.

<p/>I got rid of my injured feelings for the time by kicking them into the
brewery wall, and twisting them out of my hair, and then I smoothed my
face with my sleeve, and came from behind the gate. The bread and meat
were acceptable, and the beer was warming and tingling, and I was soon
in spirits to look about me.

<p/>To be sure, it was a deserted place, down to the pigeon-house in the
brewery-yard, which had been blown crooked on its pole by some high
wind, and would have made the pigeons think themselves at sea, if there
had been any pigeons there to be rocked by it. But there were no pigeons
in the dove-cot, no horses in the stable, no pigs in the sty, no malt in
the storehouse, no smells of grains and beer in the copper or the vat.
All the uses and scents of the brewery might have evaporated with its
last reek of smoke. In a by-yard, there was a wilderness of empty casks,
which had a certain sour remembrance of better days lingering about
them; but it was too sour to be accepted as a sample of the beer that
was gone,--and in this respect I remember those recluses as being like
most others.

<p/>Behind the furthest end of the brewery, was a rank garden with an old
wall; not so high but that I could struggle up and hold on long enough
to look over it, and see that the rank garden was the garden of the
house, and that it was overgrown with tangled weeds, but that there was
a track upon the green and yellow paths, as if some one sometimes walked
there, and that Estella was walking away from me even then. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>)
seemed to be everywhere. For when I yielded to the temptation presented
by the casks, and began to walk on them, I saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) walking on them at
the end of the yard of casks. She (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) had her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) back towards me, and held her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>)
pretty brown hair spread out in her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) two hands, and never looked round,
and passed out of my view directly. So, in the brewery itself,--by which
I mean the large paved lofty place in which they used to make the beer,
and where the brewing utensils still were. When I first went into it,
and, rather oppressed by its gloom, stood near the door looking about
me, I saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) pass among the extinguished fires, and ascend some light
iron stairs, and go out by a gallery high overhead, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) were going
out into the sky.

<p/>It was in this place, and at this moment, that a strange thing happened
to my fancy. I thought it a strange thing then, and I thought it a
stranger thing long afterwards. I turned my eyes--a little dimmed by
looking up at the frosty light--towards a great wooden beam in a low
nook of the building near me on my right hand, and I saw a figure
hanging there by the neck. A figure all in yellow white, with but
one shoe to the feet; and it hung so, that I could see that the faded
trimmings of the dress were like earthy paper, and that the face was
Miss Havisham's, with a movement going over the whole countenance as if
she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) were trying to call to me. In the terror of seeing the figure,
and in the terror of being certain that it had not been there a moment
before, I at first ran from it, and then ran towards it. And my terror
was greatest of all when I found no figure there.

<p/>Nothing less than the frosty light of the cheerful sky, the sight of
people passing beyond the bars of the court-yard gate, and the reviving
influence of the rest of the bread and meat and beer, would have brought
me round. Even with those aids, I might not have come to myself as soon
as I did, but that I saw Estella approaching with the keys, to let
me out. She (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) would have some fair reason for looking down upon me, I
thought, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) saw me frightened; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) would have no fair reason.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) gave me a triumphant glance in passing me, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) rejoiced that
my hands were so coarse and my boots were so thick, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) opened the
gate, and stood holding it. I was passing out without looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>),
when she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) touched me with a taunting hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why don't you cry?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because I don't want to.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You do,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``You have been crying till you are half blind, and
you are near crying again now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) laughed contemptuously, pushed me out, and locked the gate upon me.
I went straight to Mr. Pumblechook's, and was immensely relieved to find
him (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) not at home. So, leaving word with the shopman on what day I was
wanted at Miss Havisham's again, I set off on the four-mile walk to
our forge; pondering, as I went along, on all I had seen, and deeply
revolving that I was a common laboring-boy; that my hands were coarse;
that my boots were thick; that I had fallen into a despicable habit
of calling knaves Jacks; that I was much more ignorant than I had
considered myself last night, and generally that I was in a low-lived
bad way.




<p/>Chapter IX

<p/>When I reached home, my sister was very curious to know all about Miss
Havisham's, and asked a number of questions. And I soon found myself
getting heavily bumped from behind in the nape of the neck and the small
of the back, and having my face ignominiously shoved against the kitchen
wall, because I did not answer those questions at sufficient length.

<p/>If a dread of not being understood be hidden in the breasts of other
young people to anything like the extent to which it used to be hidden
in mine,--which I consider probable, as I have no particular reason
to suspect myself of having been a monstrosity,--it is the key to many
reservations. I felt convinced that if I described Miss Havisham's as my
eyes had seen it, I should not be understood. Not only that, but I felt
convinced that Miss Havisham too would not be understood; and although
she (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) was perfectly incomprehensible to me, I entertained an impression
that there would be something coarse and treacherous in my dragging
her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) really was -LRB-to say nothing of Miss Estella-RRB- before the
contemplation of Mrs. Joe. Consequently, I said as little as I could,
and had my face shoved against the kitchen wall.

<p/>The worst of it was that that bullying old Pumblechook, preyed upon by
a devouring curiosity to be informed of all I had seen and heard, came
gaping over in his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) chaise-cart at tea-time, to have the details divulged
to him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>). And the mere sight of the torment, with his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) fishy eyes and mouth
open, his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) sandy hair inquisitively on end, and his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) waistcoat heaving
with windy arithmetic, made me vicious in my reticence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, boy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Uncle</b></font>)</div>Uncle Pumblechook began, as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) was seated in the
chair of honor by the fire. <div class="bookquote">``How did you get on up town?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I answered, <div class="bookquote">``Pretty well, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>and my sister shook her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) fist at me.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Pretty well?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Pumblechook/Pumblechook</b></font>)</div>Mr. Pumblechook repeated. <div class="bookquote">``Pretty well is no answer. Tell
us what you mean by pretty well, boy?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Whitewash on the forehead hardens the brain into a state of obstinacy
perhaps. Anyhow, with whitewash from the wall on my forehead, my
obstinacy was adamantine. I reflected for some time, and then answered
as if I had discovered a new idea, <div class="bookquote">``I mean pretty well.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>My sister with an exclamation of impatience was going to fly at me,--I
had no shadow of defence, for Joe was busy in the forge,--when Mr.
Pumblechook interposed with <div class="bookquote">``No! Don't lose your temper. Leave this
lad to me, ma’am; leave this lad to me.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Pumblechook/Pumblechook</b></font>)</div>Mr. Pumblechook then turned me
towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>), as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) were going to cut my hair, and said,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``First -LRB-to get our thoughts in order-RRB-: Forty-three pence?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>I calculated the consequences of replying <div class="bookquote">``Four Hundred Pound,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>and
finding them against me, went as near the answer as I could--which was
somewhere about eightpence off. Mr. Pumblechook then put me through my
pence-table from <div class="bookquote">``twelve pence make one shilling,''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>up to <div class="bookquote">``forty pence
make three and fourpence,''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>and then triumphantly demanded, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) had
done for me, <div class="bookquote">``Now! How much is forty-three pence?''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>To which I replied,
after a long interval of reflection, <div class="bookquote">``I don't know.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>And I was so
aggravated that I almost doubt if I did know.

<p/>Mr. Pumblechook worked his (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) head like a screw to screw it out of me,
and said, <div class="bookquote">``Is forty-three pence seven and sixpence three fardens, for
instance?''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes!''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I. And although my sister instantly boxed my ears, it was
highly gratifying to me to see that the answer spoilt his (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) joke, and
brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) to a dead stop.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Boy! What like is Miss Havisham?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Pumblechook/Pumblechook</b></font>)</div>Mr. Pumblechook began again when
he (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) had recovered; folding his (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) arms tight on his (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) chest and applying the
screw.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very tall and dark,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is she (<font color='blue'><b>Boy</b></font>), uncle?''  (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div>asked my sister.

<p/>Mr. Pumblechook winked assent; from which I at once inferred that he (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) had
never seen Miss Havisham, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) was nothing of the kind.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Pumblechook/Pumblechook</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Pumblechook conceitedly. -LRB-<div class="bookquote">``This is the way to have him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>)!
We are beginning to hold our own, I think, Mum?'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>-RRB-

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sure, uncle,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>returned Mrs. Joe, <div class="bookquote">``I wish you had him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) always; you
know so well how to deal with him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, boy! What was she (<font color='blue'><b>Mum</b></font>) a doing of, when you went in today?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Pumblechook/Pumblechook</b></font>)</div>asked Mr.
Pumblechook.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Mum</b></font>) was sitting,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I answered, <div class="bookquote">``in a black velvet coach.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Pumblechook and Mrs. Joe stared at one another--as they well
might--and both repeated, <div class="bookquote">``In a black velvet coach?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I. <div class="bookquote">``And Miss Estella--that's her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) niece, I think--handed her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>)
in cake and wine at the coach-window, on a gold plate. And we all had
cake and wine on gold plates. And I got up behind the coach to eat mine,
because she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) told me to.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Was anybody else there?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Pumblechook/Pumblechook</b></font>)</div>asked Mr. Pumblechook.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Four dogs,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Large or small?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Immense,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I. <div class="bookquote">``And they fought for veal-cutlets out of a silver
basket.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Pumblechook and Mrs. Joe stared at one another again, in utter
amazement. I was perfectly frantic,--a reckless witness under the
torture,--and would have told them anything.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where was this coach, in the name of gracious?''  (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div>asked my sister.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``In Miss Havisham's room.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>They stared again. <div class="bookquote">``But there weren't any
horses to it.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I added this saving clause, in the moment of rejecting
four richly caparisoned coursers which I had had wild thoughts of
harnessing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Can this be possible, uncle?''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>asked Mrs. Joe. <div class="bookquote">``What can the boy mean?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll tell you, Mum,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Pumblechook/Pumblechook</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Pumblechook. <div class="bookquote">``My opinion is, it's a
sedan-chair. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mum</b></font>)'s flighty, you know,--very flighty,--quite flighty
enough to pass her (<font color='blue'><b>Mum</b></font>) days in a sedan-chair.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did you ever see her (<font color='blue'><b>Mum</b></font>) in it, uncle?''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>asked Mrs. Joe.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How could I,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) returned, forced to the admission, <div class="bookquote">``when I never see
her (<font color='blue'><b>Mum</b></font>) in my life? Never clapped eyes upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Mum</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Goodness, uncle! And yet you have spoken to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mum</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, don't you know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Pumblechook/Pumblechook</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Pumblechook, testily, <div class="bookquote">``that when I have
been there, I have been took up to the outside of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mum</b></font>) door, and the door
has stood ajar, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mum</b></font>) has spoke to me that way. Don't say you don't
know that, Mum. Howsever, the boy went there to play. What did you play
at, boy?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Pumblechook/Pumblechook</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We played with flags,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said. -LRB-I beg to observe that I think of myself
with amazement, when I recall the lies I told on this occasion.-RRB-

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Flags!''  (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div>echoed my sister.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I. <div class="bookquote">``Estella waved a blue flag, and I waved a red one, and
Miss Havisham waved one sprinkled all over with little gold stars, out
at the coach-window. And then we all waved our swords and hurrahed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Swords!''  (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div>repeated my sister. <div class="bookquote">``Where did you get swords from?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Out of a cupboard,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I. <div class="bookquote">``And I saw pistols in it,--and jam,--and
pills. And there was no daylight in the room, but it was all lighted up
with candles.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's true, Mum,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Pumblechook/Pumblechook</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Pumblechook, with a grave nod. <div class="bookquote">``That's the
state of the case, for that much I've seen myself.''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>And then they
both stared at me, and I, with an obtrusive show of artlessness on my
countenance, stared at them, and plaited the right leg of my trousers
with my right hand.

<p/>If they had asked me any more questions, I should undoubtedly have
betrayed myself, for I was even then on the point of mentioning that
there was a balloon in the yard, and should have hazarded the statement
but for my invention being divided between that phenomenon and a bear
in the brewery. They were so much occupied, however, in discussing the
marvels I had already presented for their consideration, that I escaped.
The subject still held them when Joe came in from his (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) work to have a cup
of tea. To whom my sister, more for the relief of her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) own mind than for
the gratification of his (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>), related my pretended experiences.

<p/>Now, when I saw Joe open his (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) blue eyes and roll them all round the
kitchen in helpless amazement, I was overtaken by penitence; but only as
regarded him (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>),--not in the least as regarded the other two. Towards
Joe, and Joe only, I considered myself a young monster, while they sat
debating what results would come to me from Miss Havisham's acquaintance
and favor. They had no doubt that Miss Havisham would <div class="bookquote">``do something''
 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Havisham</b></font>)</div>for me; their doubts related to the form that something would take.
My sister stood out for <div class="bookquote">``property.''  (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div>Mr. Pumblechook was in favor of a
handsome premium for binding me apprentice to some genteel trade,--say,
the corn and seed trade, for instance. Joe fell into the deepest
disgrace with both, for offering the bright suggestion that I might only
be presented with one of the dogs who had fought for the veal-cutlets.
<div class="bookquote">``If a fool's head can't express better opinions than that,''  (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div>said my
sister, <div class="bookquote">``and you have got any work to do, you had better go and do it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div>So he (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) went.

<p/>After Mr. Pumblechook had driven off, and when my sister was washing up,
I stole into the forge to Joe, and remained by him (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) until he (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) had done for
the night. Then I said, <div class="bookquote">``Before the fire goes out, Joe, I should like to
tell you something.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Should you, Pip?''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>said Joe, drawing his (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) shoeing-stool near the forge.
<div class="bookquote">``Then tell us. What is it, Pip?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Joe,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, taking hold of his (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) rolled-up shirt sleeve, and twisting
it between my finger and thumb, <div class="bookquote">``you remember all that about Miss
Havisham's?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Remember?''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>said Joe. <div class="bookquote">``I believe you! Wonderful!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's a terrible thing, Joe; it ain't true.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What are you telling of, Pip?''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>cried Joe, falling back in the greatest
amazement. <div class="bookquote">``You don't mean to say it's--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes I do; it's lies, Joe.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But not all of it? Why sure you don't mean to say, Pip, that there was
no black welwet co--eh?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>For, I stood shaking my head. <div class="bookquote">``But at least
there was dogs, Pip? Come, Pip,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>said Joe, persuasively, <div class="bookquote">``if there
warn't no weal-cutlets, at least there was dogs?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, Joe.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A dog?''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>said Joe. <div class="bookquote">``A puppy? Come?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, Joe, there was nothing at all of the kind.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>As I fixed my eyes hopelessly on Joe, Joe contemplated me in dismay.
<div class="bookquote">``Pip, old chap! This won't do, old fellow! I say! Where do you expect to
go to?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's terrible, Joe; ain't it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Terrible?''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>cried Joe. <div class="bookquote">``Awful! What possessed you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know what possessed me, Joe,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I replied, letting his (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) shirt
sleeve go, and sitting down in the ashes at his (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) feet, hanging my head;
<div class="bookquote">``but I wish you hadn't taught me to call Knaves at cards Jacks; and I
wish my boots weren't so thick nor my hands so coarse.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>And then I told Joe that I felt very miserable, and that I hadn't been
able to explain myself to Mrs. Joe and Pumblechook, who were so rude to
me, and that there had been a beautiful young lady at Miss Havisham's
who was dreadfully proud, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) had said I was common, and that I
knew I was common, and that I wished I was not common, and that the lies
had come of it somehow, though I didn't know how.

<p/>This was a case of metaphysics, at least as difficult for Joe to deal
with as for me. But Joe took the case altogether out of the region of
metaphysics, and by that means vanquished it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There's one thing you may be sure of, Pip,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>said Joe, after some
rumination, <div class="bookquote">``namely, that lies is lies. Howsever they come, they didn't
ought to come, and they come from the father of lies, and work round to
the same. Don't you tell no more of `em, Pip. That ain't the way to get
out of being common, old chap. And as to being common, I don't make
it out at all clear. You are oncommon in some things. You're oncommon
small. Likewise you're a oncommon scholar.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I am ignorant and backward, Joe.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, see what a letter you wrote last night! Wrote in print even! I've
seen letters--Ah! and from gentlefolks!--that I'll swear weren't wrote
in print,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>said Joe.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have learnt next to nothing, Joe. You think much of me. It's only
that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, Pip,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>said Joe, <div class="bookquote">``be it so or be it son't, you must be a common
scholar afore you can be a oncommon one, I should hope! The king upon
his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) throne, with his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) crown upon his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) ed, can't sit and write his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) acts
of Parliament in print, without having begun, when he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) were a unpromoted
Prince, with the alphabet.--Ah!''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>added Joe, with a shake of the head
that was full of meaning, <div class="bookquote">``and begun at A too, and worked his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) way to Z.
And I know what that is to do, though I can't say I've exactly done it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div><p/>There was some hope in this piece of wisdom, and it rather encouraged
me.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Whether common ones as to callings and earnings,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>pursued Joe,
reflectively, <div class="bookquote">``mightn't be the better of continuing for to keep
company with common ones, instead of going out to play with oncommon
ones,--which reminds me to hope that there were a flag, perhaps?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, Joe.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``-LRB-I'm sorry there weren't a flag, Pip-RRB-. Whether that might be or
mightn't be, is a thing as can't be looked into now, without putting
your sister on the Rampage; and that's a thing not to be thought of as
being done intentional. Lookee here, Pip, at what is said to you by a
true friend. Which this to you the true friend say. If you can't get to
be oncommon through going straight, you'll never get to do it through
going crooked. So don't tell no more on `em, Pip, and live well and die
happy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are not angry with me, Joe?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, old chap. But bearing in mind that them were which I meantersay
of a stunning and outdacious sort,--alluding to them which bordered on
weal-cutlets and dog-fighting,--a sincere well-wisher would adwise, Pip,
their being dropped into your meditations, when you go upstairs to bed.
That's all, old chap, and don't never do it no more.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>When I got up to my little room and said my prayers, I did not forget
Joe's recommendation, and yet my young mind was in that disturbed and
unthankful state, that I thought long after I laid me down, how common
Estella would consider Joe, a mere blacksmith; how thick his (<font color='blue'><b>blacksmith</b></font>) boots, and
how coarse his (<font color='blue'><b>blacksmith</b></font>) hands. I thought how Joe and my sister were then sitting
in the kitchen, and how I had come up to bed from the kitchen, and how
Miss Havisham and Estella never sat in a kitchen, but were far above the
level of such common doings. I fell asleep recalling what I <div class="bookquote">``used to
do''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>when I was at Miss Havisham's; as though I had been there weeks or
months, instead of hours; and as though it were quite an old subject of
remembrance, instead of one that had arisen only that day.

<p/>That was a memorable day to me, for it made great changes in me. But it
is the same with any life. Imagine one selected day struck out of it,
and think how different its course would have been. Pause you who read
this, and think for a moment of the long chain of iron or gold,
of thorns or flowers, that would never have bound you, but for the
formation of the first link on one memorable day.




<p/>Chapter X

<p/>The felicitous idea occurred to me a morning or two later when I woke,
that the best step I could take towards making myself uncommon was to
get out of Biddy everything she (<font color='blue'><b>Biddy</b></font>) knew. In pursuance of this luminous
conception I mentioned to Biddy when I went to Mr. Wopsle's great-aunt's
at night, that I had a particular reason for wishing to get on in life,
and that I should feel very much obliged to her (<font color='blue'><b>great-aunt</b></font>) if she (<font color='blue'><b>great-aunt</b></font>) would impart
all her (<font color='blue'><b>great-aunt</b></font>) learning to me. Biddy, who was the most obliging of girls,
immediately said she (<font color='blue'><b>great-aunt</b></font>) would, and indeed began to carry out her (<font color='blue'><b>great-aunt</b></font>) promise
within five minutes.

<p/>The Educational scheme or Course established by Mr. Wopsle's great-aunt
may be resolved into the following synopsis. The pupils ate apples
and put straws down one another's backs, until Mr. Wopsle's great-aunt
collected her (<font color='blue'><b>great-aunt</b></font>) energies, and made an indiscriminate totter at them with
a birch-rod. After receiving the charge with every mark of derision, the
pupils formed in line and buzzingly passed a ragged book from hand to
hand. The book had an alphabet in it, some figures and tables, and
a little spelling,--that is to say, it had had once. As soon as this
volume began to circulate, Mr. Wopsle's great-aunt fell into a state of
coma, arising either from sleep or a rheumatic paroxysm. The pupils then
entered among themselves upon a competitive examination on the subject
of Boots, with the view of ascertaining who could tread the hardest upon
whose toes. This mental exercise lasted until Biddy made a rush at
them and distributed three defaced Bibles -LRB-shaped as if they had been
unskilfully cut off the chump end of something-RRB-, more illegibly printed
at the best than any curiosities of literature I have since met with,
speckled all over with ironmould, and having various specimens of the
insect world smashed between their leaves. This part of the Course was
usually lightened by several single combats between Biddy and refractory
students. When the fights were over, Biddy gave out the number of a
page, and then we all read aloud what we could,--or what we couldn't--in
a frightful chorus; Biddy leading with a high, shrill, monotonous voice,
and none of us having the least notion of, or reverence for, what we
were reading about. When this horrible din had lasted a certain time,
it mechanically awoke Mr. Wopsle's great-aunt, who staggered at a boy
fortuitously, and pulled his (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) ears. This was understood to terminate
the Course for the evening, and we emerged into the air with shrieks of
intellectual victory. It is fair to remark that there was no prohibition
against any pupil's entertaining himself with a slate or even with the
ink -LRB-when there was any-RRB-, but that it was not easy to pursue that branch
of study in the winter season, on account of the little general shop
in which the classes were holden--and which was also Mr. Wopsle's
great-aunt's sitting-room and bedchamber--being but faintly illuminated
through the agency of one low-spirited dip-candle and no snuffers.

<p/>It appeared to me that it would take time to become uncommon, under
these circumstances: nevertheless, I resolved to try it, and that
very evening Biddy entered on our special agreement, by imparting some
information from her (<font color='blue'><b>great-aunt</b></font>) little catalogue of Prices, under the head of moist
sugar, and lending me, to copy at home, a large old English D which she (<font color='blue'><b>great-aunt</b></font>)
had imitated from the heading of some newspaper, and which I supposed,
until she (<font color='blue'><b>great-aunt</b></font>) told me what it was, to be a design for a buckle.

<p/>Of course there was a public-house in the village, and of course Joe
liked sometimes to smoke his (<font color='blue'><b>great-aunt</b></font>) pipe there. I had received strict orders
from my sister to call for him (<font color='blue'><b>great-aunt</b></font>) at the Three Jolly Bargemen, that
evening, on my way from school, and bring him (<font color='blue'><b>great-aunt</b></font>) home at my peril. To the
Three Jolly Bargemen, therefore, I directed my steps.

<p/>There was a bar at the Jolly Bargemen, with some alarmingly long chalk
scores in it on the wall at the side of the door, which seemed to me to
be never paid off. They had been there ever since I could remember, and
had grown more than I had. But there was a quantity of chalk about our
country, and perhaps the people neglected no opportunity of turning it
to account.

<p/>It being Saturday night, I found the landlord looking rather grimly
at these records; but as my business was with Joe and not with him (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>), I
merely wished him (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) good evening, and passed into the common room at the
end of the passage, where there was a bright large kitchen fire,
and where Joe was smoking his (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) pipe in company with Mr. Wopsle and a
stranger. Joe greeted me as usual with <div class="bookquote">``Halloa, Pip, old chap!''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>and the
moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) said that, the stranger turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) head and looked at me.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) was a secret-looking man whom I had never seen before. His (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) head was
all on one side, and one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) eyes was half shut up, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) were
taking aim at something with an invisible gun. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) had a pipe in his (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>)
mouth, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) took it out, and, after slowly blowing all his (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) smoke away
and looking hard at me all the time, nodded. So, I nodded, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>)
nodded again, and made room on the settle beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) that I might sit
down there.

<p/>But as I was used to sit beside Joe whenever I entered that place of
resort, I said <div class="bookquote">``No, thank you, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>and fell into the space Joe made
for me on the opposite settle. The strange man, after glancing at Joe,
and seeing that his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) attention was otherwise engaged, nodded to me again
when I had taken my seat, and then rubbed his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) leg--in a very odd way, as
it struck me.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You was saying,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the strange man, turning to Joe, <div class="bookquote">``that you was a
blacksmith.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. I said it, you know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>said Joe.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What'll you drink, Mr.--? You didn't mention your name, by the bye.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div><p/>Joe mentioned it now, and the strange man called him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) by it. <div class="bookquote">``What'll you
drink, Mr. Gargery? At my expense? To top up with?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>said Joe, <div class="bookquote">``to tell you the truth, I ain't much in the habit of
drinking at anybody's expense but my own.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Habit? No,''  (<font color='red'><b>the stranger</b></font>)</div>returned the stranger, <div class="bookquote">``but once and away, and on a
Saturday night too. Come! Put a name to it, Mr. Gargery.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the stranger</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wouldn't wish to be stiff company,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>said Joe. <div class="bookquote">``Rum.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Rum,''  (<font color='red'><b>the stranger</b></font>)</div>repeated the stranger. <div class="bookquote">``And will the other gentleman originate a
sentiment.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Rum,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wopsle/Wopsle</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Wopsle.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Three Rums!''  (<font color='red'><b>the stranger</b></font>)</div>cried the stranger, calling to the landlord. <div class="bookquote">``Glasses
round!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``This other gentleman,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>observed Joe, by way of introducing Mr. Wopsle,
<div class="bookquote">``is a gentleman that you would like to hear give it out. Our clerk at
church.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wopsle/Wopsle</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Aha!''  (<font color='red'><b>the stranger</b></font>)</div>said the stranger, quickly, and cocking his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) eye at me. <div class="bookquote">``The
lonely church, right out on the marshes, with graves round it!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>said Joe.

<p/>The stranger, with a comfortable kind of grunt over his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) pipe, put
his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) legs up on the settle that he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) had to himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) wore a flapping
broad-brimmed traveller's hat, and under it a handkerchief tied over his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>)
head in the manner of a cap: so that he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) showed no hair. As he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) looked
at the fire, I thought I saw a cunning expression, followed by a
half-laugh, come into his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not acquainted with this country, gentlemen, but it seems a
solitary country towards the river.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Most marshes is solitary,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>said Joe.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No doubt, no doubt. Do you find any gypsies, now, or tramps, or
vagrants of any sort, out there?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>said Joe; <div class="bookquote">``none but a runaway convict now and then. And we don't
find them, easy. Eh, Mr. Wopsle?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Wopsle, with a majestic remembrance of old discomfiture, assented;
but not warmly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Seems you have been out after such?''  (<font color='red'><b>the stranger</b></font>)</div>asked the stranger.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Once,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>returned Joe. <div class="bookquote">``Not that we wanted to take them, you understand;
we went out as lookers on; me, and Mr. Wopsle, and Pip. Didn't us, Pip?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Joe.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The stranger</b></font>)</div><p/>The stranger looked at me again,--still cocking his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) eye, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) were
expressly taking aim at me with his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) invisible gun,--and said, <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>)'s a
likely young parcel of bones that. What is it you call him (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pip,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>said Joe.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Christened Pip?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, not christened Pip.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Surname Pip?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>said Joe, <div class="bookquote">``it's a kind of family name what he (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) gave himself when a
infant, and is called by.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Son of yours?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>said Joe, meditatively, not, of course, that it could be in
anywise necessary to consider about it, but because it was the way at
the Jolly Bargemen to seem to consider deeply about everything that was
discussed over pipes,--<div class="bookquote">``well--no. No, he (<font color='blue'><b>Son</b></font>) ain't.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nevvy?''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the strange man.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>said Joe, with the same appearance of profound cogitation, <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Son</b></font>)
is not--no, not to deceive you, he (<font color='blue'><b>Son</b></font>) is not--my nevvy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What the Blue Blazes is he (<font color='blue'><b>Son</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>the stranger</b></font>)</div>asked the stranger. Which appeared to me
to be an inquiry of unnecessary strength.

<p/>Mr. Wopsle struck in upon that; as one who knew all about relationships,
having professional occasion to bear in mind what female relations a man
might not marry; and expounded the ties between me and Joe. Having
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand in, Mr. Wopsle finished off with a most terrifically snarling
passage from Richard the Third, and seemed to think he (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) had done quite
enough to account for it when he (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``--as the poet says.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And here I may remark that when Mr. Wopsle referred to me, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) considered
it a necessary part of such reference to rumple my hair and poke it into
my eyes. I cannot conceive why everybody of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) standing who visited
at our house should always have put me through the same inflammatory
process under similar circumstances. Yet I do not call to mind that I
was ever in my earlier youth the subject of remark in our social family
circle, but some large-handed person took some such ophthalmic steps to
patronize me.

<p/>All this while, the strange man looked at nobody but me, and looked at
me as if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) were determined to have a shot at me at last, and bring me
down. But he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said nothing after offering his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) Blue Blazes observation,
until the glasses of rum and water were brought; and then he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) made his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
shot, and a most extraordinary shot it was.

<p/>It was not a verbal remark, but a proceeding in dumb-show, and was
pointedly addressed to me. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stirred his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) rum and water pointedly at me,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) tasted his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) rum and water pointedly at me. And he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stirred it and
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) tasted it; not with a spoon that was brought to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), but with a file.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did this so that nobody but I saw the file; and when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had done it
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wiped the file and put it in a breast-pocket. I knew it to be
Joe's file, and I knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knew my convict, the moment I saw the
instrument. I sat gazing at him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), spell-bound. But he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) now reclined on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
settle, taking very little notice of me, and talking principally about
turnips.

<p/>There was a delicious sense of cleaning-up and making a quiet pause
before going on in life afresh, in our village on Saturday nights, which
stimulated Joe to dare to stay out half an hour longer on Saturdays
than at other times. The half-hour and the rum and water running out
together, Joe got up to go, and took me by the hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Stop half a moment, Mr. Gargery,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the strange man. <div class="bookquote">``I think I've
got a bright new shilling somewhere in my pocket, and if I have, the boy
shall have it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) looked it out from a handful of small change, folded it in some
crumpled paper, and gave it to me. <div class="bookquote">``Yours!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Mind! Your own.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I thanked him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), staring at him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) far beyond the bounds of good manners,
and holding tight to Joe. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) gave Joe good-night, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) gave Mr. Wopsle
good-night -LRB-who went out with us-RRB-, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) gave me only a look with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
aiming eye,--no, not a look, for he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shut it up, but wonders may be done
with an eye by hiding it.

<p/>On the way home, if I had been in a humor for talking, the talk must
have been all on my side, for Mr. Wopsle parted from us at the door of
the Jolly Bargemen, and Joe went all the way home with his (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) mouth wide
open, to rinse the rum out with as much air as possible. But I was in
a manner stupefied by this turning up of my old misdeed and old
acquaintance, and could think of nothing else.

<p/>My sister was not in a very bad temper when we presented ourselves in
the kitchen, and Joe was encouraged by that unusual circumstance to tell
her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) about the bright shilling. <div class="bookquote">``A bad un, I'll be bound,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Joe
triumphantly, <div class="bookquote">``or he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) wouldn't have given it to the boy! Let's look at
it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div><p/>I took it out of the paper, and it proved to be a good one. <div class="bookquote">``But what's
this?''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Joe, throwing down the shilling and catching up the
paper. <div class="bookquote">``Two One-Pound notes?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Nothing less than two fat sweltering one-pound notes that seemed to have
been on terms of the warmest intimacy with all the cattle-markets in
the county. Joe caught up his (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) hat again, and ran with them to the Jolly
Bargemen to restore them to their owner. While he (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) was gone, I sat down
on my usual stool and looked vacantly at my sister, feeling pretty sure
that the man would not be there.

<p/>Presently, Joe came back, saying that the man was gone, but that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>),
Joe, had left word at the Three Jolly Bargemen concerning the notes.
Then my sister sealed them up in a piece of paper, and put them under
some dried rose-leaves in an ornamental teapot on the top of a press in
the state parlor. There they remained, a nightmare to me, many and many
a night and day.

<p/>I had sadly broken sleep when I got to bed, through thinking of the
strange man taking aim at me with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) invisible gun, and of the guiltily
coarse and common thing it was, to be on secret terms of conspiracy with
convicts,--a feature in my low career that I had previously forgotten.
I was haunted by the file too. A dread possessed me that when I least
expected it, the file would reappear. I coaxed myself to sleep by
thinking of Miss Havisham's, next Wednesday; and in my sleep I saw
the file coming at me out of a door, without seeing who held it, and I
screamed myself awake.




<p/>Chapter XI

<p/>At the appointed time I returned to Miss Havisham's, and my hesitating
ring at the gate brought out Estella. She (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) locked it after admitting
me, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) had done before, and again preceded me into the dark passage
where her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) candle stood. She (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) took no notice of me until she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) had the
candle in her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) hand, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) looked over her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) shoulder, superciliously
saying, <div class="bookquote">``You are to come this way to-day,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and took me to quite another
part of the house.

<p/>The passage was a long one, and seemed to pervade the whole square
basement of the Manor House. We traversed but one side of the square,
however, and at the end of it she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) stopped, and put her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) candle down and
opened a door. Here, the daylight reappeared, and I found myself in
a small paved courtyard, the opposite side of which was formed by a
detached dwelling-house, that looked as if it had once belonged to the
manager or head clerk of the extinct brewery. There was a clock in the
outer wall of this house. Like the clock in Miss Havisham's room, and
like Miss Havisham's watch, it had stopped at twenty minutes to nine.

<p/>We went in at the door, which stood open, and into a gloomy room with a
low ceiling, on the ground-floor at the back. There was some company in
the room, and Estella said to me as she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) joined it, <div class="bookquote">``You are to go and
stand there boy, till you are wanted.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``There'' (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>, being the window, I
crossed to it, and stood <div class="bookquote">``there,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>in a very uncomfortable state of mind,
looking out.

<p/>It opened to the ground, and looked into a most miserable corner of the
neglected garden, upon a rank ruin of cabbage-stalks, and one box-tree
that had been clipped round long ago, like a pudding, and had a new
growth at the top of it, out of shape and of a different color, as if
that part of the pudding had stuck to the saucepan and got burnt. This
was my homely thought, as I contemplated the box-tree. There had been
some light snow, overnight, and it lay nowhere else to my knowledge;
but, it had not quite melted from the cold shadow of this bit of garden,
and the wind caught it up in little eddies and threw it at the window,
as if it pelted me for coming there.

<p/>I divined that my coming had stopped conversation in the room, and that
its other occupants were looking at me. I could see nothing of the room
except the shining of the fire in the window-glass, but I stiffened in
all my joints with the consciousness that I was under close inspection.

<p/>There were three ladies in the room and one gentleman. Before I had been
standing at the window five minutes, they somehow conveyed to me that
they were all toadies and humbugs, but that each of them pretended not
to know that the others were toadies and humbugs: because the admission
that he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) or she (<font color='blue'><b>toadies</b></font>) did know it, would have made him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) or her (<font color='blue'><b>toadies</b></font>) out to be a toady
and humbug.

<p/>They all had a listless and dreary air of waiting somebody's pleasure,
and the most talkative of the ladies had to speak quite rigidly to
repress a yawn. This lady, whose name was Camilla, very much reminded
me of my sister, with the difference that she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) was older, and -LRB-as I found
when I caught sight of her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)-RRB- of a blunter cast of features. Indeed, when
I knew her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) better I began to think it was a Mercy she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) had any features
at all, so very blank and high was the dead wall of her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Poor dear soul!''  (<font color='red'><b>this lady</b></font>)</div>said this lady, with an abruptness of manner quite my
sister's. <div class="bookquote">``Nobody's enemy but his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) own!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It would be much more commendable to be somebody else's enemy,''  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>said
the gentleman; <div class="bookquote">``far more natural.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Cousin Raymond,''  (<font color='red'><b>another lady</b></font>)</div>observed another lady, <div class="bookquote">``we are to love our neighbor.''

 (<font color='red'><b>another lady</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sarah Pocket,''  (<font color='red'><b>Raymond/Cousin Raymond</b></font>)</div>returned Cousin Raymond, <div class="bookquote">``if a man is not his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own
neighbor, who is?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Raymond/Cousin Raymond</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Pocket laughed, and Camilla laughed and said -LRB-checking a yawn-RRB-,
<div class="bookquote">``The idea!''  (<font color='red'><b>Camilla/Mrs. Camilla</b></font>)</div>But I thought they seemed to think it rather a good
idea too. The other lady, who had not spoken yet, said gravely and
emphatically, <div class="bookquote">``Very true!''

 (<font color='red'><b>The lady</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Poor soul!''  (<font color='red'><b>Camilla/Mrs. Camilla</b></font>)</div>Camilla presently went on -LRB-I knew they had all been looking
at me in the mean time-RRB-, <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is so very strange! Would anyone believe
that when Tom's wife died, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) actually could not be induced to see the
importance of the children's having the deepest of trimmings to their
mourning? `Good Lord!' says he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>), `Camilla, what can it signify so long
as the poor bereaved little things are in black?' So like Matthew! The
idea!''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good points in him (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>), good points in him (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Raymond/Cousin Raymond</b></font>)</div>said Cousin Raymond; <div class="bookquote">``Heaven
forbid I should deny good points in him (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>); but he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) never had, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) never
will have, any sense of the proprieties.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Raymond/Cousin Raymond</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You know I was obliged,''  (<font color='red'><b>Camilla/Mrs. Camilla</b></font>)</div>said Camilla,--<div class="bookquote">``I was obliged to be firm. I
said, `It WILL NOT DO, for the credit of the family.' I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) that,
without deep trimmings, the family was disgraced. I cried about it from
breakfast till dinner. I injured my digestion. And at last he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) flung out
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) violent way, and said, with a D, `Then do as you like.' Thank
Goodness it will always be a consolation to me to know that I instantly
went out in a pouring rain and bought the things.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Camilla/Mrs. Camilla</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) paid for them, did he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) not?''  (<font color='red'><b>Estella/Miss Estella/ESTELLA</b></font>)</div>asked Estella.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's not the question, my dear child, who paid for them,''  (<font color='red'><b>Camilla/Mrs. Camilla</b></font>)</div>returned
Camilla. <div class="bookquote">``I bought them. And I shall often think of that with peace,
when I wake up in the night.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>The ringing of a distant bell, combined with the echoing of some cry or
call along the passage by which I had come, interrupted the conversation
and caused Estella to say to me, <div class="bookquote">``Now, boy!''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>On my turning round, they
all looked at me with the utmost contempt, and, as I went out, I heard
Sarah Pocket say, <div class="bookquote">``Well I am sure! What next!''  (<font color='red'><b>Sarah Pocket/Sarah/Miss Sarah Pocket</b></font>)</div>and Camilla add, with
indignation, <div class="bookquote">``Was there ever such a fancy! The i-de-a!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Camilla/Mrs. Camilla</b></font>)</div><p/>As we were going with our candle along the dark passage, Estella stopped
all of a sudden, and, facing round, said in her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) taunting manner, with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) face quite close to mine,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Estella/Miss Estella/ESTELLA</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, miss?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I answered, almost falling over her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) and checking myself.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) stood looking at me, and, of course, I stood looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Am I pretty?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; I think you are very pretty.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Am I insulting?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not so much so as you were last time,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not so much so?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) fired when she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) asked the last question, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) slapped my face with
such force as she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) had, when I answered it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``You little coarse monster, what do you think of me
now?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall not tell you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because you are going to tell upstairs. Is that it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, <div class="bookquote">``that's not it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why don't you cry again, you little wretch?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because I'll never cry for you again,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I. Which was, I suppose, as
false a declaration as ever was made; for I was inwardly crying for her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>)
then, and I know what I know of the pain she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) cost me afterwards.

<p/>We went on our way upstairs after this episode; and, as we were going
up, we met a gentleman groping his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) way down.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Whom have we here?''  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>asked the gentleman, stopping and looking at me.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A boy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Estella/Miss Estella/ESTELLA</b></font>)</div>said Estella.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was a burly man of an exceedingly dark complexion, with an
exceedingly large head, and a corresponding large hand. He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) took my chin
in his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) large hand and turned up my face to have a look at me by the
light of the candle. He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was prematurely bald on the top of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) head, and
had bushy black eyebrows that wouldn't lie down but stood up bristling.
His (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) eyes were set very deep in his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) head, and were disagreeably sharp and
suspicious. He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had a large watch-chain, and strong black dots where his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
beard and whiskers would have been if he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had let them. He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was nothing
to me, and I could have had no foresight then, that he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) ever would be
anything to me, but it happened that I had this opportunity of observing
him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) well.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Boy of the neighborhood? Hey?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How do you come here?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Havisham sent for me, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I explained.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well! Behave yourself. I have a pretty large experience of boys, and
you're a bad set of fellows. Now mind!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>), biting the side of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
great forefinger as he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) frowned at me, <div class="bookquote">``you behave yourself!''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>With those words, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) released me--which I was glad of, for his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) hand
smelt of scented soap--and went his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) way downstairs. I wondered whether
he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) could be a doctor; but no, I thought; he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) couldn't be a doctor, or he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
would have a quieter and more persuasive manner. There was not much time
to consider the subject, for we were soon in Miss Havisham's room, where
she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) and everything else were just as I had left them. Estella left me
standing near the door, and I stood there until Miss Havisham cast her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>)
eyes upon me from the dressing-table.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) said, without being startled or surprised: <div class="bookquote">``the days have worn
away, have they?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, ma’am. To-day is--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There, there, there!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>with the impatient movement of her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) fingers. <div class="bookquote">``I
don't want to know. Are you ready to play?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I was obliged to answer in some confusion, <div class="bookquote">``I don't think I am, ma’am.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not at cards again?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) demanded, with a searching look.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, ma’am; I could do that, if I was wanted.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Since this house strikes you old and grave, boy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Havisham</b></font>)</div>said Miss Havisham,
impatiently, <div class="bookquote">``and you are unwilling to play, are you willing to work?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Havisham</b></font>)</div><p/>I could answer this inquiry with a better heart than I had been able to
find for the other question, and I said I was quite willing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then go into that opposite room,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>), pointing at the door behind
me with her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) withered hand, <div class="bookquote">``and wait there till I come.''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>I crossed the staircase landing, and entered the room she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) indicated.
From that room, too, the daylight was completely excluded, and it had an
airless smell that was oppressive. A fire had been lately kindled in
the damp old-fashioned grate, and it was more disposed to go out than
to burn up, and the reluctant smoke which hung in the room seemed colder
than the clearer air,--like our own marsh mist. Certain wintry branches
of candles on the high chimney-piece faintly lighted the chamber; or it
would be more expressive to say, faintly troubled its darkness. It was
spacious, and I dare say had once been handsome, but every discernible
thing in it was covered with dust and mould, and dropping to pieces. The
most prominent object was a long table with a tablecloth spread on it,
as if a feast had been in preparation when the house and the clocks all
stopped together. An epergne or centre-piece of some kind was in the
middle of this cloth; it was so heavily overhung with cobwebs that its
form was quite undistinguishable; and, as I looked along the yellow
expanse out of which I remember its seeming to grow, like a black
fungus, I saw speckle-legged spiders with blotchy bodies running home
to it, and running out from it, as if some circumstances of the greatest
public importance had just transpired in the spider community.

<p/>I heard the mice too, rattling behind the panels, as if the same
occurrence were important to their interests. But the black beetles took
no notice of the agitation, and groped about the hearth in a ponderous
elderly way, as if they were short-sighted and hard of hearing, and not
on terms with one another.

<p/>These crawling things had fascinated my attention, and I was watching
them from a distance, when Miss Havisham laid a hand upon my shoulder.
In her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) other hand she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) had a crutch-headed stick on which she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) leaned, and
she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) looked like the Witch of the place.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), pointing to the long table with her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) stick, <div class="bookquote">``is where I
will be laid when I am dead. They shall come and look at me here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>With some vague misgiving that she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) might get upon the table then and
there and die at once, the complete realization of the ghastly waxwork
at the Fair, I shrank under her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) touch.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you think that is?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) asked me, again pointing with her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)
stick; <div class="bookquote">``that, where those cobwebs are?''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't guess what it is, ma’am.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's a great cake. A bride-cake. Mine!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) looked all round the room in a glaring manner, and then said,
leaning on me while her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) hand twitched my shoulder, <div class="bookquote">``Come, come, come!
Walk me, walk me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>I made out from this, that the work I had to do, was to walk Miss
Havisham round and round the room. Accordingly, I started at once, and
she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) leaned upon my shoulder, and we went away at a pace that might have
been an imitation -LRB-founded on my first impulse under that roof-RRB- of Mr.
Pumblechook's chaise-cart.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) was not physically strong, and after a little time said, <div class="bookquote">``Slower!''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>Still, we went at an impatient fitful speed, and as we went, she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)
twitched the hand upon my shoulder, and worked her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) mouth, and led me to
believe that we were going fast because her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) thoughts went fast. After a
while she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Call Estella!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>so I went out on the landing and
roared that name as I had done on the previous occasion. When her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) light
appeared, I returned to Miss Havisham, and we started away again round
and round the room.

<p/>If only Estella had come to be a spectator of our proceedings, I should
have felt sufficiently discontented; but as she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) brought with her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) the
three ladies and the gentleman whom I had seen below, I didn't know
what to do. In my politeness, I would have stopped; but Miss
Havisham twitched my shoulder, and we posted on,--with a shame-faced
consciousness on my part that they would think it was all my doing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear Miss Havisham,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sarah Pocket/Sarah/Miss Sarah Pocket</b></font>)</div>said Miss Sarah Pocket. <div class="bookquote">``How well you look!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>returned Miss Havisham. <div class="bookquote">``I am yellow skin and bone.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Camilla/Mrs. Camilla</b></font>)</div><p/>Camilla brightened when Miss Pocket met with this rebuff; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>)
murmured, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) plaintively contemplated Miss Havisham, <div class="bookquote">``Poor dear
soul! Certainly not to be expected to look well, poor thing. The idea!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Havisham</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And how are you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Camilla/Mrs. Camilla</b></font>)</div>said Miss Havisham to Camilla. As we were close to
Camilla then, I would have stopped as a matter of course, only Miss
Havisham wouldn't stop. We swept on, and I felt that I was highly
obnoxious to Camilla.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you, Miss Havisham,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) returned, <div class="bookquote">``I am as well as can be
expected.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, what's the matter with you?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>asked Miss Havisham, with exceeding
sharpness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing worth mentioning,''  (<font color='red'><b>Camilla/Mrs. Camilla</b></font>)</div>replied Camilla. <div class="bookquote">``I don't wish to make a
display of my feelings, but I have habitually thought of you more in the
night than I am quite equal to.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then don't think of me,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>retorted Miss Havisham.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very easily said!''  (<font color='red'><b>Camilla/Mrs. Camilla</b></font>)</div>remarked Camilla, amiably repressing a sob, while a
hitch came into her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) upper lip, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) tears overflowed. <div class="bookquote">``Raymond is a
witness what ginger and sal volatile I am obliged to take in the night.
Raymond is a witness what nervous jerkings I have in my legs. Chokings
and nervous jerkings, however, are nothing new to me when I think with
anxiety of those I love. If I could be less affectionate and sensitive,
I should have a better digestion and an iron set of nerves. I am sure
I wish it could be so. But as to not thinking of you in the night--The
idea!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Here, a burst of tears.

<p/>The Raymond referred to, I understood to be the gentleman present, and
him (<font color='blue'><b>Raymond</b></font>) I understood to be Mr. Camilla. He (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) came to the rescue at this point,
and said in a consolatory and complimentary voice, <div class="bookquote">``Camilla, my dear, it
is well known that your family feelings are gradually undermining you to
the extent of making one of your legs shorter than the other.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not aware,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>observed the grave lady whose voice I had heard but
once, <div class="bookquote">``that to think of any person is to make a great claim upon that
person, my dear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Sarah Pocket, whom I now saw to be a little dry, brown, corrugated
old woman, with a small face that might have been made of walnut-shells,
and a large mouth like a cat's without the whiskers, supported this
position by saying, <div class="bookquote">``No, indeed, my dear. Hem!''

 (<font color='red'><b>a cat</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thinking is easy enough,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>said the grave lady.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is easier, you know?''  (<font color='red'><b>Sarah Pocket/Sarah/Miss Sarah Pocket</b></font>)</div>assented Miss Sarah Pocket.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes, yes!''  (<font color='red'><b>Camilla/Mrs. Camilla</b></font>)</div>cried Camilla, whose fermenting feelings appeared to
rise from her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) legs to her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) bosom. <div class="bookquote">``It's all very true! It's a weakness
to be so affectionate, but I can't help it. No doubt my health would be
much better if it was otherwise, still I wouldn't change my disposition
if I could. It's the cause of much suffering, but it's a consolation to
know I posses it, when I wake up in the night.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Here another burst of
feeling.

<p/>Miss Havisham and I had never stopped all this time, but kept going
round and round the room; now brushing against the skirts of the
visitors, now giving them the whole length of the dismal chamber.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There's Matthew!''  (<font color='red'><b>Camilla/Mrs. Camilla</b></font>)</div>said Camilla. <div class="bookquote">``Never mixing with any natural ties,
never coming here to see how Miss Havisham is! I have taken to the sofa
with my staylace cut, and have lain there hours insensible, with my head
over the side, and my hair all down, and my feet I don't know where--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Camilla</b></font>)</div><p/>-LRB-<div class="bookquote">``Much higher than your head, my love,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Camilla</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Camilla.-RRB-

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have gone off into that state, hours and hours, on account of
Matthew's strange and inexplicable conduct, and nobody has thanked me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Really I must say I should think not!''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>interposed the grave lady.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You see, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sarah Pocket/Sarah/Miss Sarah Pocket</b></font>)</div>added Miss Sarah Pocket -LRB-a blandly vicious
personage-RRB-, <div class="bookquote">``the question to put to yourself is, who did you expect to
thank you, my love?''

 (<font color='red'><b>a personage</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Without expecting any thanks, or anything of the sort,''  (<font color='red'><b>Camilla/Mrs. Camilla</b></font>)</div>resumed
Camilla, <div class="bookquote">``I have remained in that state, hours and hours, and Raymond
is a witness of the extent to which I have choked, and what the total
inefficacy of ginger has been, and I have been heard at the piano-forte
tuner's across the street, where the poor mistaken children have even
supposed it to be pigeons cooing at a distance,--and now to be told--''
 (<font color='red'><b>Camilla/Mrs. Camilla</b></font>)</div>Here Camilla put her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) hand to her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) throat, and began to be quite chemical
as to the formation of new combinations there.

<p/>When this same Matthew was mentioned, Miss Havisham stopped me and
herself, and stood looking at the speaker. This change had a great
influence in bringing Camilla's chemistry to a sudden end.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Matthew will come and see me at last,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Havisham</b></font>)</div>said Miss Havisham, sternly,
<div class="bookquote">``when I am laid on that table. That will be his (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) place,--there,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Havisham</b></font>)</div>striking
the table with her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) stick, <div class="bookquote">``at my head! And yours will be there! And your
husband's there! And Sarah Pocket's there! And Georgiana's there! Now
you all know where to take your stations when you come to feast upon me.
And now go!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>At the mention of each name, she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) had struck the table with her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) stick in
a new place. She (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) now said, <div class="bookquote">``Walk me, walk me!''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>and we went on again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose there's nothing to be done,''  (<font color='red'><b>Camilla/Mrs. Camilla</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Camilla, <div class="bookquote">``but comply
and depart. It's something to have seen the object of one's love and
duty for even so short a time. I shall think of it with a melancholy
satisfaction when I wake up in the night. I wish Matthew could have
that comfort, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) sets it at defiance. I am determined not to make a
display of my feelings, but it's very hard to be told one wants to feast
on one's relations,--as if one was a Giant,--and to be told to go. The
bare idea!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Camilla/Mrs. Camilla</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Camilla interposing, as Mrs. Camilla laid her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) hand upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) heaving
bosom, that lady assumed an unnatural fortitude of manner which I
supposed to be expressive of an intention to drop and choke when out of
view, and kissing her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) hand to Miss Havisham, was escorted forth. Sarah
Pocket and Georgiana contended who should remain last; but Sarah was
too knowing to be outdone, and ambled round Georgiana with that artful
slipperiness that the latter was obliged to take precedence. Sarah
Pocket then made her (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) separate effect of departing with, <div class="bookquote">``Bless you, Miss
Havisham dear!''  (<font color='red'><b>Sarah Pocket/Sarah/Miss Sarah Pocket</b></font>)</div>and with a smile of forgiving pity on her (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) walnut-shell
countenance for the weaknesses of the rest.

<p/>While Estella was away lighting them down, Miss Havisham still walked
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) hand on my shoulder, but more and more slowly. At last she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>)
stopped before the fire, and said, after muttering and looking at it
some seconds,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This is my birthday, Pip.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>I was going to wish her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) many happy returns, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) lifted her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) stick.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't suffer it to be spoken of. I don't suffer those who were here
just now, or any one to speak of it. They come here on the day, but they
dare not refer to it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Of course I made no further effort to refer to it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``On this day of the year, long before you were born, this heap of
decay,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>stabbing with her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) crutched stick at the pile of cobwebs on the
table, but not touching it, <div class="bookquote">``was brought here. It and I have worn away
together. The mice have gnawed at it, and sharper teeth than teeth of
mice have gnawed at me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) held the head of her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) stick against her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) heart as she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) stood looking
at the table; she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) once white dress, all yellow and withered; the
once white cloth all yellow and withered; everything around in a state
to crumble under a touch.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``When the ruin is complete,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>), with a ghastly look, <div class="bookquote">``and when
they lay me dead, in my bride's dress on the bride's table,--which shall
be done, and which will be the finished curse upon him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>),--so much the
better if it is done on this day!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) stood looking at the table as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) stood looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) own figure
lying there. I remained quiet. Estella returned, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) too remained
quiet. It seemed to me that we continued thus for a long time. In
the heavy air of the room, and the heavy darkness that brooded in its
remoter corners, I even had an alarming fancy that Estella and I might
presently begin to decay.

<p/>At length, not coming out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) distraught state by degrees, but in an
instant, Miss Havisham said, <div class="bookquote">``Let me see you two play cards; why have
you not begun?''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Havisham</b></font>)</div>With that, we returned to her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) room, and sat down as
before; I was beggared, as before; and again, as before, Miss Havisham
watched us all the time, directed my attention to Estella's beauty, and
made me notice it the more by trying her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) jewels on Estella's breast and
hair.

<p/>Estella, for her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) part, likewise treated me as before, except that she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>)
did not condescend to speak. When we had played some half-dozen games,
a day was appointed for my return, and I was taken down into the yard
to be fed in the former dog-like manner. There, too, I was again left to
wander about as I liked.

<p/>It is not much to the purpose whether a gate in that garden wall which
I had scrambled up to peep over on the last occasion was, on that last
occasion, open or shut. Enough that I saw no gate then, and that I
saw one now. As it stood open, and as I knew that Estella had let
the visitors out,--for she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) had returned with the keys in her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) hand,--I
strolled into the garden, and strolled all over it. It was quite a
wilderness, and there were old melon-frames and cucumber-frames in it,
which seemed in their decline to have produced a spontaneous growth of
weak attempts at pieces of old hats and boots, with now and then a weedy
offshoot into the likeness of a battered saucepan.

<p/>When I had exhausted the garden and a greenhouse with nothing in it but
a fallen-down grape-vine and some bottles, I found myself in the dismal
corner upon which I had looked out of the window. Never questioning for
a moment that the house was now empty, I looked in at another window,
and found myself, to my great surprise, exchanging a broad stare with a
pale young gentleman with red eyelids and light hair.

<p/>This pale young gentleman quickly disappeared, and reappeared beside me.
He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had been at his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) books when I had found myself staring at him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>), and I
now saw that he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was inky.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Halloa!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``young fellow!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Halloa being a general observation which I had usually observed to
be best answered by itself, I said, <div class="bookquote">``Halloa!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>politely omitting young
fellow.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who let you in?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Estella.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who gave you leave to prowl about?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Estella.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Come and fight,''  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>said the pale young gentleman.

<p/>What could I do but follow him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)? I have often asked myself the question
since; but what else could I do? His (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) manner was so final, and I was
so astonished, that I followed where he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) led, as if I had been under a
spell.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Stop a minute, though,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) said, wheeling round before we had gone many
paces. <div class="bookquote">``I ought to give you a reason for fighting, too. There it is!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>In a most irritating manner he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) instantly slapped his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) hands against one
another, daintily flung one of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) legs up behind him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>), pulled my hair,
slapped his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) hands again, dipped his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) head, and butted it into my stomach.

<p/>The bull-like proceeding last mentioned, besides that it was
unquestionably to be regarded in the light of a liberty, was
particularly disagreeable just after bread and meat. I therefore hit out
at him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) and was going to hit out again, when he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Aha! Would you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and began dancing backwards and forwards in a manner quite unparalleled
within my limited experience.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Laws of the game!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>). Here, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) skipped from his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) left leg on to
his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) right. <div class="bookquote">``Regular rules!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Here, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) skipped from his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) right leg on to
his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) left. <div class="bookquote">``Come to the ground, and go through the preliminaries!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Here,
he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) dodged backwards and forwards, and did all sorts of things while I
looked helplessly at him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>).

<p/>I was secretly afraid of him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) when I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) so dexterous; but I felt
morally and physically convinced that his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) light head of hair could have
had no business in the pit of my stomach, and that I had a right to
consider it irrelevant when so obtruded on my attention. Therefore, I
followed him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) without a word, to a retired nook of the garden, formed by
the junction of two walls and screened by some rubbish. On his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) asking me
if I was satisfied with the ground, and on my replying Yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) begged my
leave to absent himself for a moment, and quickly returned with a bottle
of water and a sponge dipped in vinegar. <div class="bookquote">``Available for both,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) said,
placing these against the wall. And then fell to pulling off, not
only his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) jacket and waistcoat, but his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) shirt too, in a manner at once
light-hearted, business-like, and bloodthirsty.

<p/>Although he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) did not look very healthy,--having pimples on his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) face, and
a breaking out at his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) mouth,--these dreadful preparations quite appalled
me. I judged him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) to be about my own age, but he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was much taller, and he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
had a way of spinning himself about that was full of appearance. For
the rest, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was a young gentleman in a gray suit -LRB-when not denuded
for battle-RRB-, with his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) elbows, knees, wrists, and heels considerably in
advance of the rest of him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) as to development.

<p/>My heart failed me when I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) squaring at me with every
demonstration of mechanical nicety, and eyeing my anatomy as if he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) were
minutely choosing his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) bone. I never have been so surprised in my life,
as I was when I let out the first blow, and saw him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) lying on his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
back, looking up at me with a bloody nose and his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) face exceedingly
fore-shortened.

<p/>But, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was on his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) feet directly, and after sponging himself with
a great show of dexterity began squaring again. The second greatest
surprise I have ever had in my life was seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) on his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) back again,
looking up at me out of a black eye.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) spirit inspired me with great respect. He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) seemed to have no
strength, and he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) never once hit me hard, and he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was always knocked down;
but he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) would be up again in a moment, sponging himself or drinking out
of the water-bottle, with the greatest satisfaction in seconding himself
according to form, and then came at me with an air and a show that made
me believe he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) really was going to do for me at last. He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) got heavily
bruised, for I am sorry to record that the more I hit him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>), the harder I
hit him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>); but he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) came up again and again and again, until at last he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) got
a bad fall with the back of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) head against the wall. Even after that
crisis in our affairs, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) got up and turned round and round confusedly a
few times, not knowing where I was; but finally went on his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) knees to his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
sponge and threw it up: at the same time panting out, <div class="bookquote">``That means you
have won.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) seemed so brave and innocent, that although I had not proposed the
contest, I felt but a gloomy satisfaction in my victory. Indeed, I go
so far as to hope that I regarded myself while dressing as a species of
savage young wolf or other wild beast. However, I got dressed, darkly
wiping my sanguinary face at intervals, and I said, <div class="bookquote">``Can I help you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>wolf</b></font>) said <div class="bookquote">``No thankee,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and I said <div class="bookquote">``Good afternoon,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>wolf</b></font>) said <div class="bookquote">``Same
to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>When I got into the courtyard, I found Estella waiting with the keys.
But she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) neither asked me where I had been, nor why I had kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>)
waiting; and there was a bright flush upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) face, as though something
had happened to delight her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>). Instead of going straight to the gate, too,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) stepped back into the passage, and beckoned me.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come here! You may kiss me, if you like.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) cheek as she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) turned it to me. I think I would have gone
through a great deal to kiss her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) cheek. But I felt that the kiss was
given to the coarse common boy as a piece of money might have been, and
that it was worth nothing.

<p/>What with the birthday visitors, and what with the cards, and what with
the fight, my stay had lasted so long, that when I neared home the light
on the spit of sand off the point on the marshes was gleaming against
a black night-sky, and Joe's furnace was flinging a path of fire across
the road.




<p/>Chapter XII

<p/>My mind grew very uneasy on the subject of the pale young gentleman. The
more I thought of the fight, and recalled the pale young gentleman on
his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) back in various stages of puffy and incrimsoned countenance, the
more certain it appeared that something would be done to me. I felt that
the pale young gentleman's blood was on my head, and that the Law would
avenge it. Without having any definite idea of the penalties I had
incurred, it was clear to me that village boys could not go stalking
about the country, ravaging the houses of gentlefolks and pitching into
the studious youth of England, without laying themselves open to severe
punishment. For some days, I even kept close at home, and looked out at
the kitchen door with the greatest caution and trepidation before going
on an errand, lest the officers of the County Jail should pounce upon
me. The pale young gentleman's nose had stained my trousers, and I tried
to wash out that evidence of my guilt in the dead of night. I had cut
my knuckles against the pale young gentleman's teeth, and I twisted my
imagination into a thousand tangles, as I devised incredible ways of
accounting for that damnatory circumstance when I should be haled before
the Judges.

<p/>When the day came round for my return to the scene of the deed of
violence, my terrors reached their height. Whether myrmidons of Justice,
specially sent down from London, would be lying in ambush behind the
gate;--whether Miss Havisham, preferring to take personal vengeance for
an outrage done to her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) house, might rise in those grave-clothes of hers,
draw a pistol, and shoot me dead:--whether suborned boys--a numerous
band of mercenaries--might be engaged to fall upon me in the brewery,
and cuff me until I was no more;--it was high testimony to my confidence
in the spirit of the pale young gentleman, that I never imagined him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
accessory to these retaliations; they always came into my mind as the
acts of injudicious relatives of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>), goaded on by the state of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
visage and an indignant sympathy with the family features.

<p/>However, go to Miss Havisham's I must, and go I did. And behold! nothing
came of the late struggle. It was not alluded to in any way, and no pale
young gentleman was to be discovered on the premises. I found the same
gate open, and I explored the garden, and even looked in at the windows
of the detached house; but my view was suddenly stopped by the closed
shutters within, and all was lifeless. Only in the corner where
the combat had taken place could I detect any evidence of the young
gentleman's existence. There were traces of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) gore in that spot, and I
covered them with garden-mould from the eye of man.

<p/>On the broad landing between Miss Havisham's own room and that other
room in which the long table was laid out, I saw a garden-chair,--a
light chair on wheels, that you pushed from behind. It had been placed
there since my last visit, and I entered, that same day, on a regular
occupation of pushing Miss Havisham in this chair -LRB-when she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) was tired of
walking with her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) hand upon my shoulder-RRB- round her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) own room, and across
the landing, and round the other room. Over and over and over again,
we would make these journeys, and sometimes they would last as long as
three hours at a stretch. I insensibly fall into a general mention of
these journeys as numerous, because it was at once settled that I should
return every alternate day at noon for these purposes, and because I am
now going to sum up a period of at least eight or ten months.

<p/>As we began to be more used to one another, Miss Havisham talked more
to me, and asked me such questions as what had I learnt and what was
I going to be? I told her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) I was going to be apprenticed to Joe, I
believed; and I enlarged upon my knowing nothing and wanting to know
everything, in the hope that she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) might offer some help towards that
desirable end. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) did not; on the contrary, she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) seemed to prefer my
being ignorant. Neither did she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) ever give me any money,--or anything
but my daily dinner,--nor ever stipulate that I should be paid for my
services.

<p/>Estella was always about, and always let me in and out, but never told
me I might kiss her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) again. Sometimes, she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) would coldly tolerate me;
sometimes, she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) would condescend to me; sometimes, she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) would be quite
familiar with me; sometimes, she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) would tell me energetically that she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>)
hated me. Miss Havisham would often ask me in a whisper, or when we were
alone, <div class="bookquote">``Does she (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) grow prettier and prettier, Pip?''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>And when I said yes
-LRB-for indeed she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) did-RRB-, would seem to enjoy it greedily. Also, when we
played at cards Miss Havisham would look on, with a miserly relish of
Estella's moods, whatever they were. And sometimes, when her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) moods were
so many and so contradictory of one another that I was puzzled what
to say or do, Miss Havisham would embrace her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) with lavish fondness,
murmuring something in her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) ear that sounded like <div class="bookquote">``Break their hearts my
pride and hope, break their hearts and have no mercy!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Havisham</b></font>)</div><p/>There was a song Joe used to hum fragments of at the forge, of which the
burden was Old Clem. This was not a very ceremonious way of rendering
homage to a patron saint, but I believe Old Clem stood in that relation
towards smiths. It was a song that imitated the measure of beating upon
iron, and was a mere lyrical excuse for the introduction of Old Clem's
respected name. Thus, you were to hammer boys round--Old Clem! With a
thump and a sound--Old Clem! Beat it out, beat it out--Old Clem! With a
clink for the stout--Old Clem! Blow the fire, blow the fire--Old
Clem! Roaring dryer, soaring higher--Old Clem! One day soon after the
appearance of the chair, Miss Havisham suddenly saying to me, with the
impatient movement of her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) fingers, <div class="bookquote">``There, there, there! Sing!''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>I was
surprised into crooning this ditty as I pushed her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) over the floor. It
happened so to catch her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) fancy that she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) took it up in a low brooding
voice as if she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) were singing in her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) sleep. After that, it became
customary with us to have it as we moved about, and Estella would often
join in; though the whole strain was so subdued, even when there were
three of us, that it made less noise in the grim old house than the
lightest breath of wind.

<p/>What could I become with these surroundings? How could my character fail
to be influenced by them? Is it to be wondered at if my thoughts were
dazed, as my eyes were, when I came out into the natural light from the
misty yellow rooms?

<p/>Perhaps I might have told Joe about the pale young gentleman, if I had
not previously been betrayed into those enormous inventions to which
I had confessed. Under the circumstances, I felt that Joe could hardly
fail to discern in the pale young gentleman, an appropriate passenger
to be put into the black velvet coach; therefore, I said nothing of him (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>).
Besides, that shrinking from having Miss Havisham and Estella discussed,
which had come upon me in the beginning, grew much more potent as time
went on. I reposed complete confidence in no one but Biddy; but I told
poor Biddy everything. Why it came natural to me to do so, and why Biddy
had a deep concern in everything I told her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>), I did not know then, though
I think I know now.

<p/>Meanwhile, councils went on in the kitchen at home, fraught with
almost insupportable aggravation to my exasperated spirit. That ass,
Pumblechook, used often to come over of a night for the purpose of
discussing my prospects with my sister; and I really do believe -LRB-to
this hour with less penitence than I ought to feel-RRB-, that if these hands
could have taken a linchpin out of his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) chaise-cart, they would have done
it. The miserable man was a man of that confined stolidity of mind, that
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could not discuss my prospects without having me before him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>),--as it
were, to operate upon,--and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would drag me up from my stool -LRB-usually
by the collar-RRB- where I was quiet in a corner, and, putting me before the
fire as if I were going to be cooked, would begin by saying, <div class="bookquote">``Now, Mum,
here is this boy! Here is this boy which you brought up by hand. Hold up
your head, boy, and be forever grateful unto them which so did do. Now,
Mum, with respections to this boy!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>And then he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would rumple my hair
the wrong way,--which from my earliest remembrance, as already hinted,
I have in my soul denied the right of any fellow-creature to do,--and
would hold me before him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) by the sleeve,--a spectacle of imbecility only
to be equalled by himself.

<p/>Then, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and my sister would pair off in such nonsensical speculations
about Miss Havisham, and about what she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) would do with me and for me,
that I used to want--quite painfully--to burst into spiteful tears, fly
at Pumblechook, and pummel him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) all over. In these dialogues, my sister
spoke to me as if she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) were morally wrenching one of my teeth out at
every reference; while Pumblechook himself, self-constituted my patron,
would sit supervising me with a depreciatory eye, like the architect of
my fortunes who thought himself engaged on a very unremunerative job.

<p/>In these discussions, Joe bore no part. But he (<font color='blue'><b>architect</b></font>) was often talked at,
while they were in progress, by reason of Mrs. Joe's perceiving that
he (<font color='blue'><b>architect</b></font>) was not favorable to my being taken from the forge. I was fully old
enough now to be apprenticed to Joe; and when Joe sat with the poker on
his (<font color='blue'><b>architect</b></font>) knees thoughtfully raking out the ashes between the lower bars, my
sister would so distinctly construe that innocent action into opposition
on his (<font color='blue'><b>architect</b></font>) part, that she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) would dive at him (<font color='blue'><b>architect</b></font>), take the poker out of his (<font color='blue'><b>architect</b></font>)
hands, shake him (<font color='blue'><b>architect</b></font>), and put it away. There was a most irritating end to
every one of these debates. All in a moment, with nothing to lead up to
it, my sister would stop herself in a yawn, and catching sight of me as
it were incidentally, would swoop upon me with, <div class="bookquote">``Come! there's enough of
you! You get along to bed; you've given trouble enough for one night, I
hope!''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>As if I had besought them as a favor to bother my life out.

<p/>We went on in this way for a long time, and it seemed likely that we
should continue to go on in this way for a long time, when one day Miss
Havisham stopped short as she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) and I were walking, she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) leaning on my
shoulder; and said with some displeasure,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are growing tall, Pip!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>I thought it best to hint, through the medium of a meditative look, that
this might be occasioned by circumstances over which I had no control.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) said no more at the time; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) presently stopped and looked at me
again; and presently again; and after that, looked frowning and moody.
On the next day of my attendance, when our usual exercise was over, and
I had landed her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) at her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) dressing-table, she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) stayed me with a movement of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) impatient fingers:--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell me the name again of that blacksmith of yours.''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Joe Gargery, ma’am.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Meaning the master you were to be apprenticed to?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Miss Havisham.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You had better be apprenticed at once. Would Gargery come here with
you, and bring your indentures, do you think?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I signified that I had no doubt he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) would take it as an honor to be
asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then let him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) come.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``At any particular time, Miss Havisham?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There, there! I know nothing about times. Let him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) come soon, and come
along with you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>When I got home at night, and delivered this message for Joe, my sister
<div class="bookquote">``went on the Rampage,''  (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div>in a more alarming degree than at any previous
period. She (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) asked me and Joe whether we supposed she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) was door-mats under
our feet, and how we dared to use her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) so, and what company we graciously
thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) was fit for? When she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) had exhausted a torrent of such
inquiries, she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) threw a candlestick at Joe, burst into a loud sobbing,
got out the dustpan,--which was always a very bad sign,--put on her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>)
coarse apron, and began cleaning up to a terrible extent. Not satisfied
with a dry cleaning, she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) took to a pail and scrubbing-brush, and cleaned
us out of house and home, so that we stood shivering in the back-yard.
It was ten o’clock at night before we ventured to creep in again, and
then she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) asked Joe why he (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) hadn't married a Negress Slave at once?
Joe offered no answer, poor fellow, but stood feeling his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) whisker and
looking dejectedly at me, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) thought it really might have been a
better speculation.




<p/>Chapter XIII

<p/>It was a trial to my feelings, on the next day but one, to see
Joe arraying himself in his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) Sunday clothes to accompany me to Miss
Havisham's. However, as he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) thought his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) court-suit necessary to the
occasion, it was not for me to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) looked far better in his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)
working-dress; the rather, because I knew he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) made himself so dreadfully
uncomfortable, entirely on my account, and that it was for me he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) pulled
up his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) shirt-collar so very high behind, that it made the hair on the
crown of his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) head stand up like a tuft of feathers.

<p/>At breakfast-time my sister declared her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) intention of going to town with
us, and being left at Uncle Pumblechook's and called for <div class="bookquote">``when we had
done with our fine ladies'' (<font color='red'><b>Uncle</b></font>)</div>--a way of putting the case, from which Joe
appeared inclined to augur the worst. The forge was shut up for the day,
and Joe inscribed in chalk upon the door -LRB-as it was his (<font color='blue'><b>Uncle</b></font>) custom to do on
the very rare occasions when he (<font color='blue'><b>Uncle</b></font>) was not at work-RRB- the monosyllable
HOUT, accompanied by a sketch of an arrow supposed to be flying in the
direction he (<font color='blue'><b>Uncle</b></font>) had taken.

<p/>We walked to town, my sister leading the way in a very large beaver
bonnet, and carrying a basket like the Great Seal of England in plaited
Straw, a pair of pattens, a spare shawl, and an umbrella, though it
was a fine bright day. I am not quite clear whether these articles were
carried penitentially or ostentatiously; but I rather think they were
displayed as articles of property,--much as Cleopatra or any other
sovereign lady on the Rampage might exhibit her (<font color='blue'><b>Cleopatra</b></font>) wealth in a pageant or
procession.

<p/>When we came to Pumblechook's, my sister bounced in and left us. As it
was almost noon, Joe and I held straight on to Miss Havisham's house.
Estella opened the gate as usual, and, the moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) appeared, Joe took
his (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) hat off and stood weighing it by the brim in both his (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) hands; as if
he (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) had some urgent reason in his (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) mind for being particular to half a
quarter of an ounce.

<p/>Estella took no notice of either of us, but led us the way that I knew
so well. I followed next to her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>), and Joe came last. When I looked back
at Joe in the long passage, he (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) was still weighing his (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) hat with the
greatest care, and was coming after us in long strides on the tips of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) toes.

<p/>Estella told me we were both to go in, so I took Joe by the coat-cuff
and conducted him (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) into Miss Havisham's presence. She (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) was seated at her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>)
dressing-table, and looked round at us immediately.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) to Joe. <div class="bookquote">``You are the husband of the sister of this boy?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I could hardly have imagined dear old Joe looking so unlike himself or
so like some extraordinary bird; standing as he (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) did speechless, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>)
tuft of feathers ruffled, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) mouth open as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) wanted a worm.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are the husband,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Havisham</b></font>)</div>repeated Miss Havisham, <div class="bookquote">``of the sister of this
boy?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Havisham</b></font>)</div><p/>It was very aggravating; but, throughout the interview, Joe persisted in
addressing Me instead of Miss Havisham.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Which I meantersay, Pip,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>Joe now observed in a manner that was at
once expressive of forcible argumentation, strict confidence, and great
politeness, <div class="bookquote">``as I hup and married your sister, and I were at the time
what you might call -LRB-if you was anyways inclined-RRB- a single man.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Miss Havisham. <div class="bookquote">``And you have reared the boy, with the
intention of taking him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) for your apprentice; is that so, Mr. Gargery?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You know, Pip,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>replied Joe, <div class="bookquote">``as you and me were ever friends, and it
were looked for'ard to betwixt us, as being calc'lated to lead to
larks. Not but what, Pip, if you had ever made objections to the
business,--such as its being open to black and sut, or such-like,--not
but what they would have been attended to, don't you see?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Has the boy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Havisham</b></font>)</div>said Miss Havisham, <div class="bookquote">``ever made any objection? Does he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
like the trade?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Havisham</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Which it is well beknown to yourself, Pip,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>returned Joe, strengthening
his (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) former mixture of argumentation, confidence, and politeness, <div class="bookquote">``that
it were the wish of your own hart.''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>-LRB-I saw the idea suddenly break upon
him (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) would adapt his (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) epitaph to the occasion, before he (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) went on
to say-RRB- <div class="bookquote">``And there weren't no objection on your part, and Pip it were
the great wish of your hart!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>It was quite in vain for me to endeavor to make him (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) sensible that he (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>)
ought to speak to Miss Havisham. The more I made faces and gestures
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) to do it, the more confidential, argumentative, and polite, he (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>)
persisted in being to Me.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you brought his (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) indentures with you?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>asked Miss Havisham.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, Pip, you know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>replied Joe, as if that were a little
unreasonable, <div class="bookquote">``you yourself see me put `em in my `at, and therefore you
know as they are here.''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>With which he (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) took them out, and gave them, not
to Miss Havisham, but to me. I am afraid I was ashamed of the dear good
fellow,--I know I was ashamed of him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>),--when I saw that Estella stood
at the back of Miss Havisham's chair, and that her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) eyes laughed
mischievously. I took the indentures out of his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) hand and gave them to
Miss Havisham.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You expected,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Havisham</b></font>)</div>said Miss Havisham, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) looked them over, <div class="bookquote">``no premium
with the boy?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Joe!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I remonstrated, for he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) made no reply at all. <div class="bookquote">``Why don't you
answer--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pip,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>returned Joe, cutting me short as if he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) were hurt, <div class="bookquote">``which I
meantersay that were not a question requiring a answer betwixt yourself
and me, and which you know the answer to be full well No. You know it to
be No, Pip, and wherefore should I say it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Havisham glanced at him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) understood what he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) really was
better than I had thought possible, seeing what he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) was there; and took
up a little bag from the table beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Pip has earned a premium here,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``and here it is. There are
five-and-twenty guineas in this bag. Give it to your master, Pip.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>As if he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) were absolutely out of his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) mind with the wonder awakened in
him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) by her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) strange figure and the strange room, Joe, even at this pass,
persisted in addressing me.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This is wery liberal on your part, Pip,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>said Joe, <div class="bookquote">``and it is as such
received and grateful welcome, though never looked for, far nor near,
nor nowheres. And now, old chap,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>said Joe, conveying to me a sensation,
first of burning and then of freezing, for I felt as if that familiar
expression were applied to Miss Havisham,--<div class="bookquote">``and now, old chap, may we
do our duty! May you and me do our duty, both on us, by one and another,
and by them which your liberal present--have-conweyed--to be--for the
satisfaction of mind-of--them as never--''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>here Joe showed that he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) felt
he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) had fallen into frightful difficulties, until he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) triumphantly rescued
himself with the words, <div class="bookquote">``and from myself far be it!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>These words had
such a round and convincing sound for him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) said them twice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good-bye, Pip!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Miss Havisham. <div class="bookquote">``Let them out, Estella.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Am I to come again, Miss Havisham?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No. Gargery is your master now. Gargery! One word!''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>Thus calling him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) back as I went out of the door, I heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) say to Joe
in a distinct emphatic voice, <div class="bookquote">``The boy has been a good boy here, and
that is his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) reward. Of course, as an honest man, you will expect no
other and no more.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div><p/>How Joe got out of the room, I have never been able to determine; but
I know that when he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) did get out he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) was steadily proceeding upstairs
instead of coming down, and was deaf to all remonstrances until I went
after him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) and laid hold of him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>). In another minute we were outside the
gate, and it was locked, and Estella was gone. When we stood in the
daylight alone again, Joe backed up against a wall, and said to me,
<div class="bookquote">``Astonishing!''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>And there he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) remained so long saying, <div class="bookquote">``Astonishing''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>at
intervals, so often, that I began to think his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) senses were never coming
back. At length he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) prolonged his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) remark into <div class="bookquote">``Pip, I do assure you this
is as-TON-ishing!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and so, by degrees, became conversational and able to
walk away.

<p/>I have reason to think that Joe's intellects were brightened by the
encounter they had passed through, and that on our way to Pumblechook's
he (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) invented a subtle and deep design. My reason is to be found in
what took place in Mr. Pumblechook's parlor: where, on our presenting
ourselves, my sister sat in conference with that detested seedsman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well?''  (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div>cried my sister, addressing us both at once. <div class="bookquote">``And what's
happened to you? I wonder you condescend to come back to such poor
society as this, I am sure I do!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Havisham,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>said Joe, with a fixed look at me, like an effort of
remembrance, <div class="bookquote">``made it wery partick'ler that we should give her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)--were it
compliments or respects, Pip?''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Compliments,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Which that were my own belief,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>answered Joe; <div class="bookquote">``her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) compliments to Mrs.
J. Gargery--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Much good they'll do me!''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>observed my sister; but rather gratified too.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And wishing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>pursued Joe, with another fixed look at me, like another
effort of remembrance, <div class="bookquote">``that the state of Miss Havisham's elth were
sitch as would have--allowed, were it, Pip?''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gargery</b></font>) having the pleasure,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I added.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of ladies' company,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>said Joe. And drew a long breath.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well!''  (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div>cried my sister, with a mollified glance at Mr. Pumblechook.
<div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Gargery</b></font>) might have had the politeness to send that message at first, but
it's better late than never. And what did she (<font color='blue'><b>Gargery</b></font>) give young Rantipole
here?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Gargery</b></font>) giv' him (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>said Joe, <div class="bookquote">``nothing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Joe was going to break out, but Joe went on.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What she (<font color='blue'><b>Gargery</b></font>) giv',''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>said Joe, <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>Gargery</b></font>) giv' to his (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) friends. `And by his (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>)
friends,' were her (<font color='blue'><b>Gargery</b></font>) explanation, `I mean into the hands of his (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) sister
Mrs. J. Gargery.' Them were her (<font color='blue'><b>Gargery</b></font>) words; `Mrs. J. Gargery.' She (<font color='blue'><b>Gargery</b></font>) mayn't
have know'd,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>added Joe, with an appearance of reflection, <div class="bookquote">``whether it
were Joe, or Jorge.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div><p/>My sister looked at Pumblechook: who smoothed the elbows of his (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) wooden
arm-chair, and nodded at her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) and at the fire, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) had known all
about it beforehand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And how much have you got?''  (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div>asked my sister, laughing. Positively
laughing!

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What would present company say to ten pound?''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>demanded Joe.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They'd say,''  (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div>returned my sister, curtly, <div class="bookquote">``pretty well. Not too much,
but pretty well.''

 (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's more than that, then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>said Joe.

<p/>That fearful Impostor, Pumblechook, immediately nodded, and said, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>)
rubbed the arms of his (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) chair, <div class="bookquote">``It's more than that, Mum.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, you don't mean to say--''  (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div>began my sister.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes I do, Mum,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Pumblechook/Pumblechook</b></font>)</div>said Pumblechook; <div class="bookquote">``but wait a bit. Go on, Joseph. Good
in you! Go on!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Pumblechook/Pumblechook</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What would present company say,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>proceeded Joe, <div class="bookquote">``to twenty pound?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Handsome would be the word,''  (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div>returned my sister.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>said Joe, <div class="bookquote">``It's more than twenty pound.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div><p/>That abject hypocrite, Pumblechook, nodded again, and said, with a
patronizing laugh, <div class="bookquote">``It's more than that, Mum. Good again! Follow her (<font color='blue'><b>Mum</b></font>) up,
Joseph!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Pumblechook/Pumblechook</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then to make an end of it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>said Joe, delightedly handing the bag to my
sister; <div class="bookquote">``it's five-and-twenty pound.''

 (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's five-and-twenty pound, Mum,''  (<font color='red'><b>swindlers Pumblechook</b></font>)</div>echoed that basest of swindlers,
Pumblechook, rising to shake hands with her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``and it's no more than your
merits -LRB-as I said when my opinion was asked-RRB-, and I wish you joy of the
money!''

 (<font color='red'><b>swindlers Pumblechook</b></font>)</div><p/>If the villain had stopped here, his (<font color='blue'><b>villain</b></font>) case would have been sufficiently
awful, but he (<font color='blue'><b>villain</b></font>) blackened his (<font color='blue'><b>villain</b></font>) guilt by proceeding to take me into custody,
with a right of patronage that left all his (<font color='blue'><b>villain</b></font>) former criminality far
behind.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now you see, Joseph and wife,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Pumblechook/Pumblechook</b></font>)</div>said Pumblechook, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) took me by the
arm above the elbow, <div class="bookquote">``I am one of them that always go right through with
what they've begun. This boy must be bound, out of hand. That's my way.
Bound out of hand.''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Goodness knows, Uncle Pumblechook,''  (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div>said my sister -LRB-grasping the
money-RRB-, <div class="bookquote">``we're deeply beholden to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never mind me, Mum,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>returned that diabolical cornchandler. <div class="bookquote">``A
pleasure's a pleasure all the world over. But this boy, you know; we
must have him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) bound. I said I'd see to it--to tell you the truth.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The Justices</b></font>)</div><p/>The Justices were sitting in the Town Hall near at hand, and we at
once went over to have me bound apprentice to Joe in the Magisterial
presence. I say we went over, but I was pushed over by Pumblechook,
exactly as if I had that moment picked a pocket or fired a rick; indeed,
it was the general impression in Court that I had been taken red-handed;
for, as Pumblechook shoved me before him (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) through the crowd, I heard some
people say, <div class="bookquote">``What's he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) done?''  (<font color='red'><b>some people</b></font>)</div>and others, <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)'s a young `un, too, but
looks bad, don't he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>others un</b></font>)</div>One person of mild and benevolent aspect even gave
me a tract ornamented with a woodcut of a malevolent young man fitted
up with a perfect sausage-shop of fetters, and entitled TO BE READ IN MY
CELL.

<p/>The Hall was a queer place, I thought, with higher pews in it than a
church,--and with people hanging over the pews looking on,--and with
mighty Justices -LRB-one with a powdered head-RRB- leaning back in chairs, with
folded arms, or taking snuff, or going to sleep, or writing, or reading
the newspapers,--and with some shining black portraits on the walls,
which my unartistic eye regarded as a composition of hardbake and
sticking-plaster. Here, in a corner my indentures were duly signed and
attested, and I was <div class="bookquote">``bound'' (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>; Mr. Pumblechook holding me all the while
as if we had looked in on our way to the scaffold, to have those little
preliminaries disposed of.

<p/>When we had come out again, and had got rid of the boys who had been put
into great spirits by the expectation of seeing me publicly tortured,
and who were much disappointed to find that my friends were merely
rallying round me, we went back to Pumblechook's. And there my sister
became so excited by the twenty-five guineas, that nothing would serve
her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) but we must have a dinner out of that windfall at the Blue Boar, and
that Pumblechook must go over in his (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) chaise-cart, and bring the Hubbles
and Mr. Wopsle.

<p/>It was agreed to be done; and a most melancholy day I passed. For,
it inscrutably appeared to stand to reason, in the minds of the whole
company, that I was an excrescence on the entertainment. And to make it
worse, they all asked me from time to time,--in short, whenever they
had nothing else to do,--why I didn't enjoy myself? And what could I
possibly do then, but say I was enjoying myself,--when I wasn't!

<p/>However, they were grown up and had their own way, and they made the
most of it. That swindling Pumblechook, exalted into the beneficent
contriver of the whole occasion, actually took the top of the table;
and, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) addressed them on the subject of my being bound, and had
fiendishly congratulated them on my being liable to imprisonment if I
played at cards, drank strong liquors, kept late hours or bad company,
or indulged in other vagaries which the form of my indentures appeared
to contemplate as next to inevitable, he (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) placed me standing on a chair
beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) to illustrate his (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) remarks.

<p/>My only other remembrances of the great festival are, That they wouldn't
let me go to sleep, but whenever they saw me dropping off, woke me up
and told me to enjoy myself. That, rather late in the evening Mr. Wopsle
gave us Collins's ode, and threw his (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) bloodstained sword in thunder
down, with such effect, that a waiter came in and said, <div class="bookquote">``The Commercials
underneath sent up their compliments, and it wasn't the Tumblers' Arms.''
 (<font color='red'><b>a waiter</b></font>)</div>That, they were all in excellent spirits on the road home, and sang, O
Lady Fair! Mr. Wopsle taking the bass, and asserting with a tremendously
strong voice -LRB-in reply to the inquisitive bore who leads that piece
of music in a most impertinent manner, by wanting to know all about
everybody's private affairs-RRB- that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) was the man with his (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) white locks
flowing, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) was upon the whole the weakest pilgrim going.

<p/>Finally, I remember that when I got into my little bedroom, I was truly
wretched, and had a strong conviction on me that I should never like
Joe's trade. I had liked it once, but once was not now.




<p/>Chapter XIV

<p/>It is a most miserable thing to feel ashamed of home. There may be black
ingratitude in the thing, and the punishment may be retributive and well
deserved; but that it is a miserable thing, I can testify.

<p/>Home had never been a very pleasant place to me, because of my sister's
temper. But, Joe had sanctified it, and I had believed in it. I had
believed in the best parlor as a most elegant saloon; I had believed
in the front door, as a mysterious portal of the Temple of State whose
solemn opening was attended with a sacrifice of roast fowls; I had
believed in the kitchen as a chaste though not magnificent apartment;
I had believed in the forge as the glowing road to manhood and
independence. Within a single year all this was changed. Now it was all
coarse and common, and I would not have had Miss Havisham and Estella
see it on any account.

<p/>How much of my ungracious condition of mind may have been my own fault,
how much Miss Havisham's, how much my sister's, is now of no moment to
me or to any one. The change was made in me; the thing was done. Well or
ill done, excusably or inexcusably, it was done.

<p/>Once, it had seemed to me that when I should at last roll up my
shirt-sleeves and go into the forge, Joe's `prentice, I should be
distinguished and happy. Now the reality was in my hold, I only felt
that I was dusty with the dust of small-coal, and that I had a weight
upon my daily remembrance to which the anvil was a feather. There have
been occasions in my later life -LRB-I suppose as in most lives-RRB- when I have
felt for a time as if a thick curtain had fallen on all its interest
and romance, to shut me out from anything save dull endurance any more.
Never has that curtain dropped so heavy and blank, as when my way in
life lay stretched out straight before me through the newly entered road
of apprenticeship to Joe.

<p/>I remember that at a later period of my <div class="bookquote">``time,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I used to stand about
the churchyard on Sunday evenings when night was falling, comparing my
own perspective with the windy marsh view, and making out some likeness
between them by thinking how flat and low both were, and how on both
there came an unknown way and a dark mist and then the sea. I was quite
as dejected on the first working-day of my apprenticeship as in that
after-time; but I am glad to know that I never breathed a murmur to Joe
while my indentures lasted. It is about the only thing I am glad to know
of myself in that connection.

<p/>For, though it includes what I proceed to add, all the merit of what I
proceed to add was Joe's. It was not because I was faithful, but because
Joe was faithful, that I never ran away and went for a soldier or
a sailor. It was not because I had a strong sense of the virtue of
industry, but because Joe had a strong sense of the virtue of industry,
that I worked with tolerable zeal against the grain. It is not possible
to know how far the influence of any amiable honest-hearted duty-doing
man flies out into the world; but it is very possible to know how it has
touched one's self in going by, and I know right well that any good that
intermixed itself with my apprenticeship came of plain contented Joe,
and not of restlessly aspiring discontented me.

<p/>What I wanted, who can say? How can I say, when I never knew? What
I dreaded was, that in some unlucky hour I, being at my grimiest and
commonest, should lift up my eyes and see Estella looking in at one
of the wooden windows of the forge. I was haunted by the fear that she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>)
would, sooner or later, find me out, with a black face and hands, doing
the coarsest part of my work, and would exult over me and despise me.
Often after dark, when I was pulling the bellows for Joe, and we were
singing Old Clem, and when the thought how we used to sing it at Miss
Havisham's would seem to show me Estella's face in the fire, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>)
pretty hair fluttering in the wind and her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) eyes scorning me,--often at
such a time I would look towards those panels of black night in the wall
which the wooden windows then were, and would fancy that I saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) just
drawing her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) face away, and would believe that she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) had come at last.

<p/>After that, when we went into supper, the place and the meal would have
a more homely look than ever, and I would feel more ashamed of home than
ever, in my own ungracious breast.




<p/>Chapter XV

<p/>As I was getting too big for Mr. Wopsle's great-aunt's room, my
education under that preposterous female terminated. Not, however, until
Biddy had imparted to me everything she (<font color='blue'><b>great-aunt</b></font>) knew, from the little catalogue
of prices, to a comic song she (<font color='blue'><b>great-aunt</b></font>) had once bought for a half-penny.
Although the only coherent part of the latter piece of literature were
the opening lines.

<p/>When I went to Lunnon town sirs,
Too rul loo rul
Too rul loo rul
Wasn't I done very brown sirs?
Too rul loo rul
Too rul loo rul

<p/>--still, in my desire to be wiser, I got this composition by heart with the utmost gravity; nor do I recollect that I questioned its merit, except that I
thought -LRB-as I still do-RRB- the amount of Too rul somewhat in excess of the
poetry. In my hunger for information, I made proposals to Mr. Wopsle to
bestow some intellectual crumbs upon me, with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) kindly complied.
As it turned out, however, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) only wanted me for a dramatic
lay-figure, to be contradicted and embraced and wept over and bullied
and clutched and stabbed and knocked about in a variety of ways, I soon
declined that course of instruction; though not until Mr. Wopsle in his (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>)
poetic fury had severely mauled me.

<p/>Whatever I acquired, I tried to impart to Joe. This statement sounds so
well, that I cannot in my conscience let it pass unexplained. I wanted
to make Joe less ignorant and common, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) might be worthier of my
society and less open to Estella's reproach.

<p/>The old Battery out on the marshes was our place of study, and a broken
slate and a short piece of slate-pencil were our educational implements:
to which Joe always added a pipe of tobacco. I never knew Joe to
remember anything from one Sunday to another, or to acquire, under my
tuition, any piece of information whatever. Yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) would smoke his (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) pipe
at the Battery with a far more sagacious air than anywhere else,--even
with a learned air,--as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) considered himself to be advancing
immensely. Dear fellow, I hope he (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) did.

<p/>It was pleasant and quiet, out there with the sails on the river passing
beyond the earthwork, and sometimes, when the tide was low, looking
as if they belonged to sunken ships that were still sailing on at the
bottom of the water. Whenever I watched the vessels standing out to sea
with their white sails spread, I somehow thought of Miss Havisham and
Estella; and whenever the light struck aslant, afar off, upon a cloud
or sail or green hillside or water-line, it was just the same.--Miss
Havisham and Estella and the strange house and the strange life appeared
to have something to do with everything that was picturesque.

<p/>One Sunday when Joe, greatly enjoying his (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) pipe, had so plumed himself on
being <div class="bookquote">``most awful dull,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>that I had given him (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) up for the day, I lay on
the earthwork for some time with my chin on my hand, descrying traces of
Miss Havisham and Estella all over the prospect, in the sky and in the
water, until at last I resolved to mention a thought concerning them
that had been much in my head.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Joe,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I; <div class="bookquote">``don't you think I ought to make Miss Havisham a visit?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, Pip,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>returned Joe, slowly considering. <div class="bookquote">``What for?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What for, Joe? What is any visit made for?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There is some wisits p'r'aps,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>said Joe, <div class="bookquote">``as for ever remains open to
the question, Pip. But in regard to wisiting Miss Havisham. She (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) might
think you wanted something,--expected something of her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't you think I might say that I did not, Joe?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You might, old chap,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>said Joe. <div class="bookquote">``And she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) might credit it. Similarly she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>)
mightn't.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div><p/>Joe felt, as I did, that he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) had made a point there, and he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) pulled hard
at his (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) pipe to keep himself from weakening it by repetition.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You see, Pip,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>Joe pursued, as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) was past that danger, <div class="bookquote">``Miss
Havisham done the handsome thing by you. When Miss Havisham done the
handsome thing by you, she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) called me back to say to me as that were
all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Joe. I heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``ALL,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>Joe repeated, very emphatically.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Joe. I tell you, I heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Which I meantersay, Pip, it might be that her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) meaning were,--Make a
end on it!--As you was!--Me to the North, and you to the South!--Keep in
sunders!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I had thought of that too, and it was very far from comforting to me
to find that he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) had thought of it; for it seemed to render it more
probable.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But, Joe.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, old chap.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Here am I, getting on in the first year of my time, and, since the day
of my being bound, I have never thanked Miss Havisham, or asked after
her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>), or shown that I remember her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's true, Pip; and unless you was to turn her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) out a set of shoes
all four round,--and which I meantersay as even a set of shoes all
four round might not be acceptable as a present, in a total wacancy of
hoofs--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't mean that sort of remembrance, Joe; I don't mean a present.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div><p/>But Joe had got the idea of a present in his (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) head and must harp upon it.
<div class="bookquote">``Or even,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``if you was helped to knocking her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) up a new chain
for the front door,--or say a gross or two of shark-headed screws for
general use,--or some light fancy article, such as a toasting-fork
when she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) took her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) muffins,--or a gridiron when she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) took a sprat or such
like--''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't mean any present at all, Joe,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>I interposed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>said Joe, still harping on it as though I had particularly
pressed it, <div class="bookquote">``if I was yourself, Pip, I wouldn't. No, I would not. For
what's a door-chain when she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>)'s got one always up? And shark-headers is
open to misrepresentations. And if it was a toasting-fork, you'd go into
brass and do yourself no credit. And the oncommonest workman can't show
himself oncommon in a gridiron,--for a gridiron IS a gridiron,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said
Joe, steadfastly impressing it upon me, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) were endeavouring to
rouse me from a fixed delusion, <div class="bookquote">``and you may haim at what you like, but
a gridiron it will come out, either by your leave or again your leave,
and you can't help yourself--''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear Joe,''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>I cried, in desperation, taking hold of his (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) coat, <div class="bookquote">``don't
go on in that way. I never thought of making Miss Havisham any present.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, Pip,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>Joe assented, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) had been contending for that, all
along; <div class="bookquote">``and what I say to you is, you are right, Pip.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Joe; but what I wanted to say, was, that as we are rather slack
just now, if you would give me a half-holiday to-morrow, I think I would
go uptown and make a call on Miss Est--Havisham.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Which her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) name,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>said Joe, gravely, <div class="bookquote">``ain't Estavisham, Pip, unless she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>)
have been rechris'ened.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know, Joe, I know. It was a slip of mine. What do you think of it,
Joe?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div><p/>In brief, Joe thought that if I thought well of it, he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) thought well of
it. But, he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) was particular in stipulating that if I were not received
with cordiality, or if I were not encouraged to repeat my visit as a
visit which had no ulterior object but was simply one of gratitude for a
favor received, then this experimental trip should have no successor. By
these conditions I promised to abide.

<p/>Now, Joe kept a journeyman at weekly wages whose name was Orlick.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) pretended that his (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) Christian name was Dolge,--a clear
Impossibility,--but he (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) was a fellow of that obstinate disposition that I
believe him (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) to have been the prey of no delusion in this particular, but
wilfully to have imposed that name upon the village as an affront to its
understanding. He (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) was a broadshouldered loose-limbed swarthy fellow of
great strength, never in a hurry, and always slouching. He (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) never even
seemed to come to his (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) work on purpose, but would slouch in as if by mere
accident; and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) went to the Jolly Bargemen to eat his (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) dinner, or
went away at night, he (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) would slouch out, like Cain or the Wandering Jew,
as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) had no idea where he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) was going and no intention of ever
coming back. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) lodged at a sluice-keeper's out on the marshes, and on
working-days would come slouching from his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) hermitage, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) hands in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) pockets and his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) dinner loosely tied in a bundle round his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) neck
and dangling on his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) back. On Sundays he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) mostly lay all day on the
sluice-gates, or stood against ricks and barns. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) always slouched,
locomotively, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) eyes on the ground; and, when accosted or
otherwise required to raise them, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) looked up in a half-resentful,
half-puzzled way, as though the only thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) ever had was, that it
was rather an odd and injurious fact that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) should never be thinking.

<p/>This morose journeyman had no liking for me. When I was very small and
timid, he (<font color='blue'><b>journeyman</b></font>) gave me to understand that the Devil lived in a black corner
of the forge, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Devil</b></font>) knew the fiend very well: also that it was
necessary to make up the fire, once in seven years, with a live boy, and
that I might consider myself fuel. When I became Joe's `prentice, Orlick
was perhaps confirmed in some suspicion that I should displace him (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>);
howbeit, he (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) liked me still less. Not that he (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) ever said anything, or did
anything, openly importing hostility; I only noticed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) always beat
his (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) sparks in my direction, and that whenever I sang Old Clem, he (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) came
in out of time.

<p/>Dolge Orlick was at work and present, next day, when I reminded Joe of
my half-holiday. He (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) said nothing at the moment, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) and Joe had just
got a piece of hot iron between them, and I was at the bellows; but by
and by he (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) said, leaning on his (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) hammer,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, master! Sure you're not a going to favor only one of us. If Young
Pip has a half-holiday, do as much for Old Orlick.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>I suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) was
about five-and-twenty, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) usually spoke of himself as an ancient
person.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, what'll you do with a half-holiday, if you get it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>said Joe.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What'll I do with it! What'll he (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) do with it? I'll do as much with it as
him (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Orlick/Old Orlick</b></font>)</div>said Orlick.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``As to Pip, he (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>)'s going up town,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>said Joe.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well then, as to Old Orlick, he (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>)'s a going up town,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>retorted that
worthy. ``Two can go up town. Tain't only one wot can go up town.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't lose your temper,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>said Joe.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Shall if I like,''  (<font color='red'><b>Orlick/Old Orlick</b></font>)</div>growled Orlick. <div class="bookquote">``Some and their uptowning! Now,
master! Come. No favoring in this shop. Be a man!''

 (<font color='red'><b>The master</b></font>)</div><p/>The master refusing to entertain the subject until the journeyman was in
a better temper, Orlick plunged at the furnace, drew out a red-hot
bar, made at me with it as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) were going to run it through my body,
whisked it round my head, laid it on the anvil, hammered it out,--as
if it were I, I thought, and the sparks were my spirting blood,--and
finally said, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) had hammered himself hot and the iron cold, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>)
again leaned on his (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) hammer,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, master!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you all right now?''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>demanded Joe.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! I am all right,''  (<font color='red'><b>Orlick/Old Orlick</b></font>)</div>said gruff Old Orlick.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then, as in general you stick to your work as well as most men,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>said
Joe, <div class="bookquote">``let it be a half-holiday for all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div><p/>My sister had been standing silent in the yard, within hearing,--she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) was
a most unscrupulous spy and listener,--and she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) instantly looked in at
one of the windows.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Like you, you fool!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) to Joe, <div class="bookquote">``giving holidays to great idle
hulkers like that. You are a rich man, upon my life, to waste wages in
that way. I wish I was his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) master!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You'd be everybody's master, if you durst,''  (<font color='red'><b>Orlick/Old Orlick</b></font>)</div>retorted Orlick, with an
ill-favored grin.

<p/>-LRB-<div class="bookquote">``Let her (<font color='blue'><b>everybody</b></font>) alone,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>said Joe.-RRB-

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'd be a match for all noodles and all rogues,''  (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div>returned my sister,
beginning to work herself into a mighty rage. <div class="bookquote">``And I couldn't be a
match for the noodles, without being a match for your master, who's the
dunder-headed king of the noodles. And I couldn't be a match for the
rogues, without being a match for you, who are the blackest-looking and
the worst rogue between this and France. Now!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You're a foul shrew, Mother Gargery,''  (<font color='red'><b>the journeyman</b></font>)</div>growled the journeyman. <div class="bookquote">``If that
makes a judge of rogues, you ought to be a good'un.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>-LRB-<div class="bookquote">``Let her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) alone, will you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>said Joe.-RRB-

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What did you say?''  (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div>cried my sister, beginning to scream. <div class="bookquote">``What did you
say? What did that fellow Orlick say to me, Pip? What did he (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) call me,
with my husband standing by? Oh! oh! oh!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Each of these exclamations was
a shriek; and I must remark of my sister, what is equally true of all
the violent women I have ever seen, that passion was no excuse for
her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>), because it is undeniable that instead of lapsing into passion, she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)
consciously and deliberately took extraordinary pains to force herself
into it, and became blindly furious by regular stages; <div class="bookquote">``what was the
name he (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) gave me before the base man who swore to defend me? Oh! Hold me!
Oh!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah-h-h!''  (<font color='red'><b>the journeyman</b></font>)</div>growled the journeyman, between his (<font color='blue'><b>journeyman</b></font>) teeth, <div class="bookquote">``I'd hold you, if
you was my wife. I'd hold you under the pump, and choke it out of you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the journeyman</b></font>)</div><p/>-LRB-<div class="bookquote">``I tell you, let her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) alone,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>said Joe.-RRB-

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! To hear him (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div>cried my sister, with a clap of her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) hands and a
scream together,--which was her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) next stage. <div class="bookquote">``To hear the names he (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>)'s
giving me! That Orlick! In my own house! Me, a married woman! With my
husband standing by! Oh! Oh!''  (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div>Here my sister, after a fit of clappings
and screamings, beat her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) hands upon her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) bosom and upon her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) knees, and
threw her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) cap off, and pulled her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) hair down,--which were the last stages
on her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) road to frenzy. Being by this time a perfect Fury and a complete
success, she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) made a dash at the door which I had fortunately locked.

<p/>What could the wretched Joe do now, after his (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) disregarded parenthetical
interruptions, but stand up to his (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) journeyman, and ask him (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) what he (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) meant
by interfering betwixt himself and Mrs. Joe; and further whether he (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) was
man enough to come on? Old Orlick felt that the situation admitted of
nothing less than coming on, and was on his (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) defence straightway; so,
without so much as pulling off their singed and burnt aprons, they went
at one another, like two giants. But, if any man in that neighborhood
could stand uplong against Joe, I never saw the man. Orlick, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>)
had been of no more account than the pale young gentleman, was very
soon among the coal-dust, and in no hurry to come out of it. Then Joe
unlocked the door and picked up my sister, who had dropped insensible
at the window -LRB-but who had seen the fight first, I think-RRB-, and who was
carried into the house and laid down, and who was recommended to revive,
and would do nothing but struggle and clench her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) hands in Joe's hair.
Then, came that singular calm and silence which succeed all uproars; and
then, with the vague sensation which I have always connected with such
a lull,--namely, that it was Sunday, and somebody was dead,--I went upstairs
to dress myself.

<p/>When I came down again, I found Joe and Orlick sweeping up, without any
other traces of discomposure than a slit in one of Orlick's nostrils,
which was neither expressive nor ornamental. A pot of beer had appeared
from the Jolly Bargemen, and they were sharing it by turns in a
peaceable manner. The lull had a sedative and philosophical influence on
Joe, who followed me out into the road to say, as a parting observation
that might do me good, <div class="bookquote">``On the Rampage, Pip, and off the Rampage,
Pip:--such is Life!''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>With what absurd emotions -LRB-for we think the feelings that are very
serious in a man quite comical in a boy-RRB- I found myself again going to
Miss Havisham's, matters little here. Nor, how I passed and repassed
the gate many times before I could make up my mind to ring. Nor, how
I debated whether I should go away without ringing; nor, how I should
undoubtedly have gone, if my time had been my own, to come back.

<p/>Miss Sarah Pocket came to the gate. No Estella.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How, then? You here again?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Miss Pocket. <div class="bookquote">``What do you want?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>When I said that I only came to see how Miss Havisham was, Sarah
evidently deliberated whether or no she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) should send me about my
business. But unwilling to hazard the responsibility, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) let me in, and
presently brought the sharp message that I was to <div class="bookquote">``come up.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Everything was unchanged, and Miss Havisham was alone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>), fixing her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) eyes upon me. <div class="bookquote">``I hope you want nothing?
You'll get nothing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No indeed, Miss Havisham. I only wanted you to know that I am doing
very well in my apprenticeship, and am always much obliged to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There, there!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>with the old restless fingers. <div class="bookquote">``Come now and then; come
on your birthday.--Ay!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) cried suddenly, turning herself and her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>)
chair towards me, <div class="bookquote">``You are looking round for Estella? Hey?''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>I had been looking round,--in fact, for Estella,--and I stammered that I
hoped she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) was well.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Abroad,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Havisham</b></font>)</div>said Miss Havisham; <div class="bookquote">``educating for a lady; far out of reach;
prettier than ever; admired by all who see her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>). Do you feel that you
have lost her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Havisham</b></font>)</div><p/>There was such a malignant enjoyment in her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) utterance of the last words,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) broke into such a disagreeable laugh, that I was at a loss what
to say. She (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) spared me the trouble of considering, by dismissing me. When
the gate was closed upon me by Sarah of the walnut-shell countenance, I
felt more than ever dissatisfied with my home and with my trade and with
everything; and that was all I took by that motion.

<p/>As I was loitering along the High Street, looking in disconsolately at
the shop windows, and thinking what I would buy if I were a gentleman,
who should come out of the bookshop but Mr. Wopsle. Mr. Wopsle had in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) hand the affecting tragedy of George Barnwell, in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) had that
moment invested sixpence, with the view of heaping every word of it on
the head of Pumblechook, with whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) was going to drink tea. No sooner
did he (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) see me, than he (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) appeared to consider that a special Providence
had put a `prentice in his (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) way to be read at; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) laid hold of me,
and insisted on my accompanying him (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) to the Pumblechookian parlor. As I
knew it would be miserable at home, and as the nights were dark and the
way was dreary, and almost any companionship on the road was better
than none, I made no great resistance; consequently, we turned into
Pumblechook's just as the street and the shops were lighting up.

<p/>As I never assisted at any other representation of George Barnwell, I
don't know how long it may usually take; but I know very well that it
took until half-past nine o' clock that night, and that when Mr. Wopsle
got into Newgate, I thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) never would go to the scaffold, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) became
so much slower than at any former period of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) disgraceful career. I
thought it a little too much that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) should complain of being cut short
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) flower after all, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) had not been running to seed, leaf
after leaf, ever since his (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) course began. This, however, was a
mere question of length and wearisomeness. What stung me, was the
identification of the whole affair with my unoffending self. When
Barnwell began to go wrong, I declare that I felt positively apologetic,
Pumblechook's indignant stare so taxed me with it. Wopsle, too, took
pains to present me in the worst light. At once ferocious and maudlin, I
was made to murder my uncle with no extenuating circumstances whatever;
Millwood put me down in argument, on every occasion; it became sheer
monomania in my master's daughter to care a button for me; and all I can
say for my gasping and procrastinating conduct on the fatal morning, is,
that it was worthy of the general feebleness of my character. Even after
I was happily hanged and Wopsle had closed the book, Pumblechook sat
staring at me, and shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) head, and saying, <div class="bookquote">``Take warning, boy,
take warning!''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>as if it were a well-known fact that I contemplated
murdering a near relation, provided I could only induce one to have the
weakness to become my benefactor.

<p/>It was a very dark night when it was all over, and when I set out with
Mr. Wopsle on the walk home. Beyond town, we found a heavy mist out, and
it fell wet and thick. The turnpike lamp was a blur, quite out of the
lamp's usual place apparently, and its rays looked solid substance on
the fog. We were noticing this, and saying how that the mist rose with a
change of wind from a certain quarter of our marshes, when we came upon
a man, slouching under the lee of the turnpike house.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Halloa!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>we said, stopping. <div class="bookquote">``Orlick there?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) answered, slouching out. <div class="bookquote">``I was standing by a minute, on the
chance of company.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are late,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I remarked.

<p/>Orlick not unnaturally answered, <div class="bookquote">``Well? And you're late.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Orlick/Old Orlick</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We have been,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wopsle/Wopsle</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Wopsle, exalted with his (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) late performance,--<div class="bookquote">``we
have been indulging, Mr. Orlick, in an intellectual evening.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wopsle/Wopsle</b></font>)</div><p/>Old Orlick growled, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) had nothing to say about that, and we all
went on together. I asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) presently whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) had been spending his (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>)
half-holiday up and down town?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``all of it. I come in behind yourself. I didn't see you,
but I must have been pretty close behind you. By the by, the guns is
going again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``At the Hulks?''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay! There's some of the birds flown from the cages. The guns have been
going since dark, about. You'll hear one presently.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div><p/>In effect, we had not walked many yards further, when the
well-remembered boom came towards us, deadened by the mist, and heavily
rolled away along the low grounds by the river, as if it were pursuing
and threatening the fugitives.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A good night for cutting off in,''  (<font color='red'><b>Orlick/Old Orlick</b></font>)</div>said Orlick. <div class="bookquote">``We'd be puzzled how to
bring down a jail-bird on the wing, to-night.''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>The subject was a suggestive one to me, and I thought about it in
silence. Mr. Wopsle, as the ill-requited uncle of the evening's tragedy,
fell to meditating aloud in his (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) garden at Camberwell. Orlick, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>)
hands in his (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) pockets, slouched heavily at my side. It was very dark,
very wet, very muddy, and so we splashed along. Now and then, the sound
of the signal cannon broke upon us again, and again rolled sulkily along
the course of the river. I kept myself to myself and my thoughts. Mr.
Wopsle died amiably at Camberwell, and exceedingly game on Bosworth
Field, and in the greatest agonies at Glastonbury. Orlick sometimes
growled, <div class="bookquote">``Beat it out, beat it out,--Old Clem! With a clink for the
stout,--Old Clem!''  (<font color='red'><b>Orlick/Old Orlick</b></font>)</div>I thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) had been drinking, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) was not drunk.

<p/>Thus, we came to the village. The way by which we approached it took us
past the Three Jolly Bargemen, which we were surprised to find--it being
eleven o’clock--in a state of commotion, with the door wide open, and
unwonted lights that had been hastily caught up and put down scattered
about. Mr. Wopsle dropped into ask what was the matter -LRB-surmising that
a convict had been taken-RRB-, but came running out in a great hurry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There's something wrong,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>), without stopping, <div class="bookquote">``up at your place,
Pip. Run all!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What is it?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked, keeping up with him (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>). So did Orlick, at my side.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't quite understand. The house seems to have been violently
entered when Joe Gargery was out. Supposed by convicts. Somebody has
been attacked and hurt.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>We were running too fast to admit of more being said, and we made no
stop until we got into our kitchen. It was full of people; the whole
village was there, or in the yard; and there was a surgeon, and there
was Joe, and there were a group of women, all on the floor in the midst
of the kitchen. The unemployed bystanders drew back when they saw me,
and so I became aware of my sister,--lying without sense or movement on
the bare boards where she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) had been knocked down by a tremendous blow
on the back of the head, dealt by some unknown hand when her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) face was
turned towards the fire,--destined never to be on the Rampage again,
while she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) was the wife of Joe.




<p/>Chapter XVI

<p/>With my head full of George Barnwell, I was at first disposed to believe
that I must have had some hand in the attack upon my sister, or at
all events that as her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) near relation, popularly known to be under
obligations to her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>), I was a more legitimate object of suspicion than
any one else. But when, in the clearer light of next morning, I began to
reconsider the matter and to hear it discussed around me on all sides, I
took another view of the case, which was more reasonable.

<p/>Joe had been at the Three Jolly Bargemen, smoking his (<font color='blue'><b>Bargemen</b></font>) pipe, from a
quarter after eight o’clock to a quarter before ten. While he (<font color='blue'><b>Bargemen</b></font>) was there,
my sister had been seen standing at the kitchen door, and had exchanged
Good Night with a farm-laborer going home. The man could not be more
particular as to the time at which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) -LRB-he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) got into dense
confusion when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) tried to be-RRB-, than that it must have been before nine.
When Joe went home at five minutes before ten, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) found her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) struck down
on the floor, and promptly called in assistance. The fire had not then
burnt unusually low, nor was the snuff of the candle very long; the
candle, however, had been blown out.

<p/>Nothing had been taken away from any part of the house. Neither, beyond
the blowing out of the candle,--which stood on a table between the door
and my sister, and was behind her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) when she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) stood facing the fire and was
struck,--was there any disarrangement of the kitchen, excepting such
as she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) herself had made, in falling and bleeding. But, there was one
remarkable piece of evidence on the spot. She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) had been struck with
something blunt and heavy, on the head and spine; after the blows were
dealt, something heavy had been thrown down at her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) with considerable
violence, as she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) lay on her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) face. And on the ground beside her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>), when Joe
picked her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) up, was a convict's leg-iron which had been filed asunder.

<p/>Now, Joe, examining this iron with a smith's eye, declared it to have
been filed asunder some time ago. The hue and cry going off to the
Hulks, and people coming thence to examine the iron, Joe's opinion
was corroborated. They did not undertake to say when it had left the
prison-ships to which it undoubtedly had once belonged; but they claimed
to know for certain that that particular manacle had not been worn by
either of the two convicts who had escaped last night. Further, one of
those two was already retaken, and had not freed himself of his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) iron.

<p/>Knowing what I knew, I set up an inference of my own here. I believed
the iron to be my convict's iron,--the iron I had seen and heard him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)
filing at, on the marshes,--but my mind did not accuse him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) of having put
it to its latest use. For I believed one of two other persons to have
become possessed of it, and to have turned it to this cruel account.
Either Orlick, or the strange man who had shown me the file.

<p/>Now, as to Orlick; he (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) had gone to town exactly as he (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) told us when we
picked him (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) up at the turnpike, he (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) had been seen about town all the
evening, he (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) had been in divers companies in several public-houses, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) had come back with myself and Mr. Wopsle. There was nothing against
him (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>), save the quarrel; and my sister had quarrelled with him (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>), and with
everybody else about her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>), ten thousand times. As to the strange man; if
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had come back for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) two bank-notes there could have been no dispute
about them, because my sister was fully prepared to restore them.
Besides, there had been no altercation; the assailant had come in so
silently and suddenly, that she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) had been felled before she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) could look
round.

<p/>It was horrible to think that I had provided the weapon, however
undesignedly, but I could hardly think otherwise. I suffered unspeakable
trouble while I considered and reconsidered whether I should at last
dissolve that spell of my childhood and tell Joe all the story. For
months afterwards, I every day settled the question finally in the
negative, and reopened and reargued it next morning. The contention
came, after all, to this;--the secret was such an old one now, had so
grown into me and become a part of myself, that I could not tear it
away. In addition to the dread that, having led up to so much mischief,
it would be now more likely than ever to alienate Joe from me if he (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>)
believed it, I had a further restraining dread that he (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) would not believe
it, but would assort it with the fabulous dogs and veal-cutlets as a
monstrous invention. However, I temporized with myself, of course--for,
was I not wavering between right and wrong, when the thing is always
done?--and resolved to make a full disclosure if I should see any
such new occasion as a new chance of helping in the discovery of the
assailant.

<p/>The Constables and the Bow Street men from London--for, this happened in
the days of the extinct red-waistcoated police--were about the house for
a week or two, and did pretty much what I have heard and read of like
authorities doing in other such cases. They took up several obviously
wrong people, and they ran their heads very hard against wrong ideas,
and persisted in trying to fit the circumstances to the ideas, instead
of trying to extract ideas from the circumstances. Also, they stood
about the door of the Jolly Bargemen, with knowing and reserved looks
that filled the whole neighborhood with admiration; and they had a
mysterious manner of taking their drink, that was almost as good as
taking the culprit. But not quite, for they never did it.

<p/>Long after these constitutional powers had dispersed, my sister lay very
ill in bed. Her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) sight was disturbed, so that she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) saw objects multiplied,
and grasped at visionary teacups and wineglasses instead of the
realities; her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) hearing was greatly impaired; her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) memory also; and her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)
speech was unintelligible. When, at last, she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) came round so far as to
be helped downstairs, it was still necessary to keep my slate always by
her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>), that she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) might indicate in writing what she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) could not indicate in
speech. As she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) was -LRB-very bad handwriting apart-RRB- a more than indifferent
speller, and as Joe was a more than indifferent reader, extraordinary
complications arose between them which I was always called in to solve.
The administration of mutton instead of medicine, the substitution of
Tea for Joe, and the baker for bacon, were among the mildest of my own
mistakes.

<p/>However, her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) temper was greatly improved, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) was patient. A
tremulous uncertainty of the action of all her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) limbs soon became a
part of her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) regular state, and afterwards, at intervals of two or three
months, she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) would often put her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) hands to her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) head, and would then remain
for about a week at a time in some gloomy aberration of mind. We were
at a loss to find a suitable attendant for her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>), until a circumstance
happened conveniently to relieve us. Mr. Wopsle's great-aunt conquered a
confirmed habit of living into which she (<font color='blue'><b>great-aunt</b></font>) had fallen, and Biddy became a
part of our establishment.

<p/>It may have been about a month after my sister's reappearance in the
kitchen, when Biddy came to us with a small speckled box containing the
whole of her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) worldly effects, and became a blessing to the household.
Above all, she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) was a blessing to Joe, for the dear old fellow was sadly
cut up by the constant contemplation of the wreck of his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) wife, and had
been accustomed, while attending on her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) of an evening, to turn to me
every now and then and say, with his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) blue eyes moistened, <div class="bookquote">``Such a fine
figure of a woman as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) once were, Pip!''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>Biddy instantly taking the
cleverest charge of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) as though she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had studied her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) from infancy; Joe
became able in some sort to appreciate the greater quiet of his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) life,
and to get down to the Jolly Bargemen now and then for a change that did
him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) good. It was characteristic of the police people that they had all
more or less suspected poor Joe -LRB-though he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) never knew it-RRB-, and that they
had to a man concurred in regarding him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) as one of the deepest spirits
they had ever encountered.

<p/>Biddy's first triumph in her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) new office, was to solve a difficulty
that had completely vanquished me. I had tried hard at it, but had made
nothing of it. Thus it was:--

<p/>Again and again and again, my sister had traced upon the slate, a
character that looked like a curious T, and then with the utmost
eagerness had called our attention to it as something she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) particularly
wanted. I had in vain tried everything producible that began with a T,
from tar to toast and tub. At length it had come into my head that the
sign looked like a hammer, and on my lustily calling that word in my
sister's ear, she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) had begun to hammer on the table and had expressed a
qualified assent. Thereupon, I had brought in all our hammers, one after
another, but without avail. Then I bethought me of a crutch, the shape
being much the same, and I borrowed one in the village, and displayed
it to my sister with considerable confidence. But she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) shook her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) head to
that extent when she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) was shown it, that we were terrified lest in her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)
weak and shattered state she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) should dislocate her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) neck.

<p/>When my sister found that Biddy was very quick to understand her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>), this
mysterious sign reappeared on the slate. Biddy looked thoughtfully
at it, heard my explanation, looked thoughtfully at my sister, looked
thoughtfully at Joe -LRB-who was always represented on the slate by his (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)
initial letter-RRB-, and ran into the forge, followed by Joe and me.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, of course!''  (<font color='red'><b>Biddy</b></font>)</div>cried Biddy, with an exultant face. <div class="bookquote">``Don't you see?
It's him (<font color='blue'><b>Clem</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Orlick/Old Orlick</b></font>)</div><p/>Orlick, without a doubt! She (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) had lost his (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) name, and could only signify
him (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) by his (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) hammer. We told him (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) why we wanted him (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) to come into the
kitchen, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) slowly laid down his (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) hammer, wiped his (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) brow with his (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>)
arm, took another wipe at it with his (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) apron, and came slouching
out, with a curious loose vagabond bend in the knees that strongly
distinguished him (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>).

<p/>I confess that I expected to see my sister denounce him (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>), and that I
was disappointed by the different result. She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) manifested the greatest
anxiety to be on good terms with him (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>), was evidently much pleased by his (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>)
being at length produced, and motioned that she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) would have him (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>)
given something to drink. She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) watched his (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) countenance as if she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) were
particularly wishful to be assured that he (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) took kindly to his (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) reception,
she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) showed every possible desire to conciliate him (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>), and there was an air
of humble propitiation in all she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) did, such as I have seen pervade the
bearing of a child towards a hard master. After that day, a day rarely
passed without her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) drawing the hammer on her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) slate, and without Orlick's
slouching in and standing doggedly before her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>), as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) knew no more
than I did what to make of it.




<p/>Chapter XVII

<p/>I now fell into a regular routine of apprenticeship life, which was
varied beyond the limits of the village and the marshes, by no more
remarkable circumstance than the arrival of my birthday and my paying
another visit to Miss Havisham. I found Miss Sarah Pocket still on duty
at the gate; I found Miss Havisham just as I had left her (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) spoke
of Estella in the very same way, if not in the very same words. The
interview lasted but a few minutes, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) gave me a guinea when I was
going, and told me to come again on my next birthday. I may mention at
once that this became an annual custom. I tried to decline taking the
guinea on the first occasion, but with no better effect than causing her (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>)
to ask me very angrily, if I expected more? Then, and after that, I took
it.

<p/>So unchanging was the dull old house, the yellow light in the darkened
room, the faded spectre in the chair by the dressing-table glass, that
I felt as if the stopping of the clocks had stopped Time in that
mysterious place, and, while I and everything else outside it grew
older, it stood still. Daylight never entered the house as to my
thoughts and remembrances of it, any more than as to the actual fact. It
bewildered me, and under its influence I continued at heart to hate my
trade and to be ashamed of home.

<p/>Imperceptibly I became conscious of a change in Biddy, however. Her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)
shoes came up at the heel, her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) hair grew bright and neat, her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) hands were
always clean. She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) was not beautiful,--she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) was common, and could not be
like Estella,--but she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) was pleasant and wholesome and sweet-tempered.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) had not been with us more than a year -LRB-I remember her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) being newly
out of mourning at the time it struck me-RRB-, when I observed to myself one
evening that she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) had curiously thoughtful and attentive eyes; eyes that
were very pretty and very good.

<p/>It came of my lifting up my own eyes from a task I was poring
at--writing some passages from a book, to improve myself in two ways at
once by a sort of stratagem--and seeing Biddy observant of what I was
about. I laid down my pen, and Biddy stopped in her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) needlework without
laying it down.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Biddy,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, <div class="bookquote">``how do you manage it? Either I am very stupid, or you
are very clever.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What is it that I manage? I don't know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Biddy</b></font>)</div>returned Biddy, smiling.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) managed our whole domestic life, and wonderfully too; but I did not
mean that, though that made what I did mean more surprising.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How do you manage, Biddy,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, <div class="bookquote">``to learn everything that I learn,
and always to keep up with me?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I was beginning to be rather vain of
my knowledge, for I spent my birthday guineas on it, and set aside the
greater part of my pocket-money for similar investment; though I have no
doubt, now, that the little I knew was extremely dear at the price.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I might as well ask you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Biddy</b></font>)</div>said Biddy, <div class="bookquote">``how you manage?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Biddy</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; because when I come in from the forge of a night, any one can see
me turning to at it. But you never turn to at it, Biddy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose I must catch it like a cough,''  (<font color='red'><b>Biddy</b></font>)</div>said Biddy, quietly; and went
on with her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) sewing.

<p/>Pursuing my idea as I leaned back in my wooden chair, and looked at
Biddy sewing away with her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) head on one side, I began to think her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) rather
an extraordinary girl. For I called to mind now, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) was equally
accomplished in the terms of our trade, and the names of our different
sorts of work, and our various tools. In short, whatever I knew, Biddy
knew. Theoretically, she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) was already as good a blacksmith as I, or
better.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are one of those, Biddy,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, <div class="bookquote">``who make the most of every
chance. You never had a chance before you came here, and see how
improved you are!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Biddy looked at me for an instant, and went on with her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) sewing. <div class="bookquote">``I was
your first teacher though; wasn't I?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>), as she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) sewed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Biddy!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I exclaimed, in amazement. <div class="bookquote">``Why, you are crying!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No I am not,''  (<font color='red'><b>Biddy</b></font>)</div>said Biddy, looking up and laughing. <div class="bookquote">``What put that in
your head?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>What could have put it in my head but the glistening of a tear as it
dropped on her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) work? I sat silent, recalling what a drudge she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) had been
until Mr. Wopsle's great-aunt successfully overcame that bad habit of
living, so highly desirable to be got rid of by some people. I recalled
the hopeless circumstances by which she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) had been surrounded in the
miserable little shop and the miserable little noisy evening school,
with that miserable old bundle of incompetence always to be dragged and
shouldered. I reflected that even in those untoward times there must
have been latent in Biddy what was now developing, for, in my first
uneasiness and discontent I had turned to her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) for help, as a matter of
course. Biddy sat quietly sewing, shedding no more tears, and while I
looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) and thought about it all, it occurred to me that perhaps
I had not been sufficiently grateful to Biddy. I might have been too
reserved, and should have patronized her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) more -LRB-though I did not use that
precise word in my meditations-RRB- with my confidence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Biddy,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I observed, when I had done turning it over, <div class="bookquote">``you were my
first teacher, and that at a time when we little thought of ever being
together like this, in this kitchen.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, poor thing!''  (<font color='red'><b>Biddy</b></font>)</div>replied Biddy. It was like her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) self-forgetfulness to
transfer the remark to my sister, and to get up and be busy about her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>),
making her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) more comfortable; <div class="bookquote">``that's sadly true!''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, <div class="bookquote">``we must talk together a little more, as we used to do.
And I must consult you a little more, as I used to do. Let us have a
quiet walk on the marshes next Sunday, Biddy, and a long chat.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>My sister was never left alone now; but Joe more than readily undertook
the care of her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) on that Sunday afternoon, and Biddy and I went out
together. It was summer-time, and lovely weather. When we had passed the
village and the church and the churchyard, and were out on the marshes
and began to see the sails of the ships as they sailed on, I began to
combine Miss Havisham and Estella with the prospect, in my usual way.
When we came to the river-side and sat down on the bank, with the water
rippling at our feet, making it all more quiet than it would have been
without that sound, I resolved that it was a good time and place for the
admission of Biddy into my inner confidence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Biddy,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, after binding her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) to secrecy, <div class="bookquote">``I want to be a
gentleman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``O, I wouldn't, if I was you!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) returned. <div class="bookquote">``I don't think it would
answer.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Biddy,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, with some severity, <div class="bookquote">``I have particular reasons for
wanting to be a gentleman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You know best, Pip; but don't you think you are happier as you are?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Biddy,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I exclaimed, impatiently, <div class="bookquote">``I am not at all happy as I am. I
am disgusted with my calling and with my life. I have never taken to
either, since I was bound. Don't be absurd.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Was I absurd?''  (<font color='red'><b>Biddy</b></font>)</div>said Biddy, quietly raising her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) eyebrows; <div class="bookquote">``I am sorry
for that; I didn't mean to be. I only want you to do well, and to be
comfortable.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Biddy</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, then, understand once for all that I never shall or can be
comfortable--or anything but miserable--there, Biddy!--unless I can lead
a very different sort of life from the life I lead now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's a pity!''  (<font color='red'><b>Biddy</b></font>)</div>said Biddy, shaking her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) head with a sorrowful air.

<p/>Now, I too had so often thought it a pity, that, in the singular kind of
quarrel with myself which I was always carrying on, I was half inclined
to shed tears of vexation and distress when Biddy gave utterance to her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>)
sentiment and my own. I told her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) was right, and I knew it was much
to be regretted, but still it was not to be helped.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If I could have settled down,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said to Biddy, plucking up the short
grass within reach, much as I had once upon a time pulled my feelings
out of my hair and kicked them into the brewery wall,--<div class="bookquote">``if I could have
settled down and been but half as fond of the forge as I was when I was
little, I know it would have been much better for me. You and I and Joe
would have wanted nothing then, and Joe and I would perhaps have gone
partners when I was out of my time, and I might even have grown up to
keep company with you, and we might have sat on this very bank on a fine
Sunday, quite different people. I should have been good enough for you;
shouldn't I, Biddy?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Biddy sighed as she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) looked at the ships sailing on, and returned for
answer, <div class="bookquote">``Yes; I am not over-particular.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>It scarcely sounded flattering,
but I knew she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) meant well.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Instead of that,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, plucking up more grass and chewing a blade or
two, <div class="bookquote">``see how I am going on. Dissatisfied, and uncomfortable, and--what
would it signify to me, being coarse and common, if nobody had told me
so!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Biddy turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) face suddenly towards mine, and looked far more
attentively at me than she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) had looked at the sailing ships.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It was neither a very true nor a very polite thing to say,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>)
remarked, directing her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) eyes to the ships again. <div class="bookquote">``Who said it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I was disconcerted, for I had broken away without quite seeing where
I was going to. It was not to be shuffled off now, however, and I
answered, <div class="bookquote">``The beautiful young lady at Miss Havisham's, and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)'s more
beautiful than anybody ever was, and I admire her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) dreadfully, and I want
to be a gentleman on her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) account.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Having made this lunatic confession,
I began to throw my torn-up grass into the river, as if I had some
thoughts of following it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you want to be a gentleman, to spite her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) or to gain her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) over?''  (<font color='red'><b>Biddy</b></font>)</div>Biddy
quietly asked me, after a pause.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I moodily answered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Because, if it is to spite her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Biddy</b></font>)</div>Biddy pursued, <div class="bookquote">``I should think--but
you know best--that might be better and more independently done by
caring nothing for her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) words. And if it is to gain her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) over, I should
think--but you know best--she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was not worth gaining over.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Biddy</b></font>)</div><p/>Exactly what I myself had thought, many times. Exactly what was
perfectly manifest to me at the moment. But how could I, a poor dazed
village lad, avoid that wonderful inconsistency into which the best and
wisest of men fall every day?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It may be all quite true,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I to Biddy, <div class="bookquote">``but I admire her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
dreadfully.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Biddy</b></font>)</div><p/>In short, I turned over on my face when I came to that, and got a good
grasp on the hair on each side of my head, and wrenched it well. All the
while knowing the madness of my heart to be so very mad and misplaced,
that I was quite conscious it would have served my face right, if I
had lifted it up by my hair, and knocked it against the pebbles as a
punishment for belonging to such an idiot.

<p/>Biddy was the wisest of girls, and she (<font color='blue'><b>idiot</b></font>) tried to reason no more with me.
She (<font color='blue'><b>idiot</b></font>) put her (<font color='blue'><b>idiot</b></font>) hand, which was a comfortable hand though roughened by work,
upon my hands, one after another, and gently took them out of my hair.
Then she (<font color='blue'><b>idiot</b></font>) softly patted my shoulder in a soothing way, while with my face
upon my sleeve I cried a little,--exactly as I had done in the brewery
yard,--and felt vaguely convinced that I was very much ill-used by
somebody, or by everybody; I can't say which.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am glad of one thing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Biddy</b></font>)</div>said Biddy, <div class="bookquote">``and that is, that you have felt
you could give me your confidence, Pip. And I am glad of another thing,
and that is, that of course you know you may depend upon my keeping it
and always so far deserving it. If your first teacher -LRB-dear! such a poor
one, and so much in need of being taught herself!-RRB- had been your teacher
at the present time, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) thinks she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) knows what lesson she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) would set. But
it would be a hard one to learn, and you have got beyond her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), and it's
of no use now.''  (<font color='red'><b>Biddy</b></font>)</div>So, with a quiet sigh for me, Biddy rose from the bank,
and said, with a fresh and pleasant change of voice, <div class="bookquote">``Shall we walk a
little farther, or go home?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Biddy</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Biddy,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I cried, getting up, putting my arm round her (<font color='blue'><b>idiot</b></font>) neck, and giving
her (<font color='blue'><b>idiot</b></font>) a kiss, <div class="bookquote">``I shall always tell you everything.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Till you're a gentleman,''  (<font color='red'><b>Biddy</b></font>)</div>said Biddy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You know I never shall be, so that's always. Not that I have any
occasion to tell you anything, for you know everything I know,--as I
told you at home the other night.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah!''  (<font color='red'><b>Biddy</b></font>)</div>said Biddy, quite in a whisper, as she (<font color='blue'><b>idiot</b></font>) looked away at the ships.
And then repeated, with her (<font color='blue'><b>idiot</b></font>) former pleasant change, <div class="bookquote">``shall we walk a
little farther, or go home?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I said to Biddy we would walk a little farther, and we did so, and the
summer afternoon toned down into the summer evening, and it was very
beautiful. I began to consider whether I was not more naturally and
wholesomely situated, after all, in these circumstances, than playing
beggar my neighbor by candle-light in the room with the stopped clocks,
and being despised by Estella. I thought it would be very good for me if
I could get her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) out of my head, with all the rest of those remembrances
and fancies, and could go to work determined to relish what I had to do,
and stick to it, and make the best of it. I asked myself the question
whether I did not surely know that if Estella were beside me at that
moment instead of Biddy, she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) would make me miserable? I was obliged to
admit that I did know it for a certainty, and I said to myself, <div class="bookquote">``Pip,
what a fool you are!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>We talked a good deal as we walked, and all that Biddy said seemed
right. Biddy was never insulting, or capricious, or Biddy to-day and
somebody else to-morrow; she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) would have derived only pain, and no
pleasure, from giving me pain; she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) would far rather have wounded her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) own
breast than mine. How could it be, then, that I did not like her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) much
the better of the two?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Biddy,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, when we were walking homeward, <div class="bookquote">``I wish you could put me
right.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish I could!''  (<font color='red'><b>Biddy</b></font>)</div>said Biddy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If I could only get myself to fall in love with you,--you don't mind my
speaking so openly to such an old acquaintance?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh dear, not at all!''  (<font color='red'><b>Biddy</b></font>)</div>said Biddy. <div class="bookquote">``Don't mind me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If I could only get myself to do it, that would be the thing for me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you never will, you see,''  (<font color='red'><b>Biddy</b></font>)</div>said Biddy.

<p/>It did not appear quite so unlikely to me that evening, as it would have
done if we had discussed it a few hours before. I therefore observed
I was not quite sure of that. But Biddy said she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) was, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) said it
decisively. In my heart I believed her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) to be right; and yet I took it
rather ill, too, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) should be so positive on the point.

<p/>When we came near the churchyard, we had to cross an embankment, and
get over a stile near a sluice-gate. There started up, from the gate, or
from the rushes, or from the ooze -LRB-which was quite in his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) stagnant way-RRB-,
Old Orlick.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Halloa!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) growled, <div class="bookquote">``where are you two going?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Where should we be going, but home?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, then,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``I'm jiggered if I don't see you home!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>This penalty of being jiggered was a favorite supposititious case of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) attached no definite meaning to the word that I am aware of, but
used it, like his (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) own pretended Christian name, to affront mankind, and
convey an idea of something savagely damaging. When I was younger, I
had had a general belief that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) had jiggered me personally, he (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) would
have done it with a sharp and twisted hook.

<p/>Biddy was much against his (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) going with us, and said to me in a whisper,
<div class="bookquote">``Don't let him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) come; I don't like him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>As I did not like him (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) either,
I took the liberty of saying that we thanked him (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>), but we didn't want
seeing home. He (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) received that piece of information with a yell of
laughter, and dropped back, but came slouching after us at a little
distance.

<p/>Curious to know whether Biddy suspected him (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) of having had a hand in
that murderous attack of which my sister had never been able to give any
account, I asked her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) why she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) did not like him (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) replied, glancing over her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) shoulder as he (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) slouched after us,
<div class="bookquote">``because I--I am afraid he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) likes me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) ever tell you he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) liked you?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked indignantly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Biddy</b></font>)</div>said Biddy, glancing over her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) shoulder again, <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) never told me
so; but he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) dances at me, whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) can catch my eye.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Biddy</b></font>)</div><p/>However novel and peculiar this testimony of attachment, I did not
doubt the accuracy of the interpretation. I was very hot indeed upon
Old Orlick's daring to admire her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>); as hot as if it were an outrage on
myself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But it makes no difference to you, you know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Biddy</b></font>)</div>said Biddy, calmly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, Biddy, it makes no difference to me; only I don't like it; I don't
approve of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nor I neither,''  (<font color='red'><b>Biddy</b></font>)</div>said Biddy. <div class="bookquote">``Though that makes no difference to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Exactly,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I; <div class="bookquote">``but I must tell you I should have no opinion of you,
Biddy, if he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) danced at you with your own consent.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I kept an eye on Orlick after that night, and, whenever circumstances
were favorable to his (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) dancing at Biddy, got before him (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) to obscure that
demonstration. He (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) had struck root in Joe's establishment, by reason
of my sister's sudden fancy for him (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>), or I should have tried to get him (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>)
dismissed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) quite understood and reciprocated my good intentions, as I
had reason to know thereafter.

<p/>And now, because my mind was not confused enough before, I complicated
its confusion fifty thousand-fold, by having states and seasons when I
was clear that Biddy was immeasurably better than Estella, and that the
plain honest working life to which I was born had nothing in it to
be ashamed of, but offered me sufficient means of self-respect
and happiness. At those times, I would decide conclusively that my
disaffection to dear old Joe and the forge was gone, and that I was
growing up in a fair way to be partners with Joe and to keep company
with Biddy,--when all in a moment some confounding remembrance of the
Havisham days would fall upon me like a destructive missile, and scatter
my wits again. Scattered wits take a long time picking up; and often
before I had got them well together, they would be dispersed in all
directions by one stray thought, that perhaps after all Miss Havisham
was going to make my fortune when my time was out.

<p/>If my time had run out, it would have left me still at the height of my
perplexities, I dare say. It never did run out, however, but was brought
to a premature end, as I proceed to relate.




<p/>Chapter XVIII

<p/>It was in the fourth year of my apprenticeship to Joe, and it was a
Saturday night. There was a group assembled round the fire at the Three
Jolly Bargemen, attentive to Mr. Wopsle as he (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) read the newspaper aloud.
Of that group I was one.

<p/>A highly popular murder had been committed, and Mr. Wopsle was imbrued
in blood to the eyebrows. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) gloated over every abhorrent adjective
in the description, and identified himself with every witness at the
Inquest. He (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) faintly moaned, <div class="bookquote">``I am done for,''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>as the victim, and he (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>)
barbarously bellowed, <div class="bookquote">``I'll serve you out,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>as the murderer. He (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) gave the
medical testimony, in pointed imitation of our local practitioner; and
he (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) piped and shook, as the aged turnpike-keeper who had heard blows, to
an extent so very paralytic as to suggest a doubt regarding the mental
competency of that witness. The coroner, in Mr. Wopsle's hands, became
Timon of Athens; the beadle, Coriolanus. He (<font color='blue'><b>beadle</b></font>) enjoyed himself thoroughly,
and we all enjoyed ourselves, and were delightfully comfortable. In this
cosey state of mind we came to the verdict Wilful Murder.

<p/>Then, and not sooner, I became aware of a strange gentleman leaning over
the back of the settle opposite me, looking on. There was an expression
of contempt on his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) face, and he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) bit the side of a great forefinger as he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
watched the group of faces.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well!''  (<font color='red'><b>the stranger</b></font>)</div>said the stranger to Mr. Wopsle, when the reading was done, <div class="bookquote">``you
have settled it all to your own satisfaction, I have no doubt?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wopsle/Wopsle</b></font>)</div><p/>Everybody started and looked up, as if it were the murderer. He (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) looked
at everybody coldly and sarcastically.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Guilty, of course?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Out with it. Come!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wopsle/Wopsle</b></font>)</div>returned Mr. Wopsle, <div class="bookquote">``without having the honor of your
acquaintance, I do say Guilty.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wopsle/Wopsle</b></font>)</div>Upon this we all took courage to unite
in a confirmatory murmur.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I know you do,''  (<font color='red'><b>the stranger</b></font>)</div>said the stranger; <div class="bookquote">``I knew you would. I told you so.
But now I'll ask you a question. Do you know, or do you not know,
that the law of England supposes every man to be innocent, until he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is
proved--proved--to be guilty?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the stranger</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wopsle/Wopsle</b></font>)</div>Mr. Wopsle began to reply, <div class="bookquote">``as an Englishman myself, I--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wopsle/Wopsle</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Come!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wopsle/Wopsle</b></font>)</div>said the stranger, biting his (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) forefinger at him (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Don't evade
the question. Either you know it, or you don't know it. Which is it to
be?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) stood with his (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) head on one side and himself on one side, in a
bullying, interrogative manner, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) threw his (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) forefinger at Mr.
Wopsle,--as it were to mark him (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) out--before biting it again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Do you know it, or don't you know it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly I know it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wopsle/Wopsle</b></font>)</div>replied Mr. Wopsle.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly you know it. Then why didn't you say so at first? Now, I'll
ask you another question,'' (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wopsle/Wopsle</b></font>)</div>--taking possession of Mr. Wopsle, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>)
had a right to him (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>),--<div class="bookquote">``do you know that none of these witnesses have yet
been cross-examined?''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Wopsle was beginning, <div class="bookquote">``I can only say--''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wopsle/Wopsle</b></font>)</div>when the stranger stopped
him (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What? You won't answer the question, yes or no? Now, I'll try you
again.''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Throwing his (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) finger at him (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) again. <div class="bookquote">``Attend to me. Are you
aware, or are you not aware, that none of these witnesses have yet been
cross-examined? Come, I only want one word from you. Yes, or no?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wopsle/Wopsle</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Wopsle hesitated, and we all began to conceive rather a poor opinion
of him (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come!''  (<font color='red'><b>the stranger</b></font>)</div>said the stranger, <div class="bookquote">``I'll help you. You don't deserve help, but
I'll help you. Look at that paper you hold in your hand. What is it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the stranger</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What is it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wopsle/Wopsle</b></font>)</div>repeated Mr. Wopsle, eyeing it, much at a loss.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it,''  (<font color='red'><b>the stranger</b></font>)</div>pursued the stranger in his (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) most sarcastic and suspicious
manner, <div class="bookquote">``the printed paper you have just been reading from?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the stranger</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Undoubtedly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Undoubtedly. Now, turn to that paper, and tell me whether it distinctly
states that the prisoner expressly said that his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) legal advisers
instructed him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) altogether to reserve his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) defence?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I read that just now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wopsle/Wopsle</b></font>)</div>Mr. Wopsle pleaded.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Never mind what you read just now, sir; I don't ask you what you read
just now. You may read the Lord's Prayer backwards, if you like,--and,
perhaps, have done it before to-day. Turn to the paper. No, no, no my
friend; not to the top of the column; you know better than that; to
the bottom, to the bottom.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wopsle/Wopsle</b></font>)</div>-LRB-We all began to think Mr. Wopsle full of
subterfuge.-RRB- <div class="bookquote">``Well? Have you found it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Here it is,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wopsle/Wopsle</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Wopsle.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, follow that passage with your eye, and tell me whether it
distinctly states that the prisoner expressly said that he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) was
instructed by his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) legal advisers wholly to reserve his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) defence? Come! Do
you make that of it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wopsle/Wopsle</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Wopsle answered, <div class="bookquote">``Those are not the exact words.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wopsle/Wopsle</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not the exact words!''  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>repeated the gentleman bitterly. <div class="bookquote">``Is that the
exact substance?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wopsle/Wopsle</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Wopsle.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>the stranger</b></font>)</div>repeated the stranger, looking round at the rest of the company
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) right hand extended towards the witness, Wopsle. <div class="bookquote">``And now I ask
you what you say to the conscience of that man who, with that passage
before his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes, can lay his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head upon his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pillow after having
pronounced a fellow-creature guilty, unheard?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wopsle/Wopsle</b></font>)</div><p/>We all began to suspect that Mr. Wopsle was not the man we had thought
him (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>), and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) was beginning to be found out.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And that same man, remember,''  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>pursued the gentleman, throwing his (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>)
finger at Mr. Wopsle heavily,--<div class="bookquote">``that same man might be summoned as a
juryman upon this very trial, and, having thus deeply committed himself,
might return to the bosom of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) family and lay his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head upon his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
pillow, after deliberately swearing that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would well and truly try the
issue joined between Our Sovereign Lord the King and the prisoner at the
bar, and would a true verdict give according to the evidence, so help
him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) God!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wopsle/Wopsle</b></font>)</div><p/>We were all deeply persuaded that the unfortunate Wopsle had gone too
far, and had better stop in his (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) reckless career while there was yet
time.

<p/>The strange gentleman, with an air of authority not to be disputed, and
with a manner expressive of knowing something secret about every one of
us that would effectually do for each individual if he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) chose to disclose
it, left the back of the settle, and came into the space between the two
settles, in front of the fire, where he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) remained standing, his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) left hand
in his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) pocket, and he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) biting the forefinger of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) right.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``From information I have received,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>), looking round at us as we
all quailed before him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``I have reason to believe there is a blacksmith
among you, by name Joseph--or Joe--Gargery. Which is the man?''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Here is the man,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>said Joe.

<p/>The strange gentleman beckoned him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) out of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) place, and Joe went.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You have an apprentice,''  (<font color='red'><b>the stranger</b></font>)</div>pursued the stranger, <div class="bookquote">``commonly known as Pip?
Is he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) here?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the stranger</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am here!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I cried.

<p/>The stranger did not recognize me, but I recognized him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) as the gentleman
I had met on the stairs, on the occasion of my second visit to Miss
Havisham. I had known him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) the moment I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) looking over the settle,
and now that I stood confronting him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) hand upon my shoulder,
I checked off again in detail his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) large head, his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) dark complexion, his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
deep-set eyes, his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) bushy black eyebrows, his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) large watch-chain, his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
strong black dots of beard and whisker, and even the smell of scented
soap on his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) great hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish to have a private conference with you two,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>), when he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had
surveyed me at his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) leisure. <div class="bookquote">``It will take a little time. Perhaps we
had better go to your place of residence. I prefer not to anticipate my
communication here; you will impart as much or as little of it as you
please to your friends afterwards; I have nothing to do with that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Amidst a wondering silence, we three walked out of the Jolly Bargemen,
and in a wondering silence walked home. While going along, the strange
gentleman occasionally looked at me, and occasionally bit the side of
his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) finger. As we neared home, Joe vaguely acknowledging the occasion as
an impressive and ceremonious one, went on ahead to open the front door.
Our conference was held in the state parlor, which was feebly lighted by
one candle.

<p/>It began with the strange gentleman's sitting down at the table, drawing
the candle to him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>), and looking over some entries in his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) pocket-book.
He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) then put up the pocket-book and set the candle a little aside, after
peering round it into the darkness at Joe and me, to ascertain which was
which.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My name,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``is Jaggers, and I am a lawyer in London. I am
pretty well known. I have unusual business to transact with you, and I
commence by explaining that it is not of my originating. If my advice
had been asked, I should not have been here. It was not asked, and you
see me here. What I have to do as the confidential agent of another, I
do. No less, no more.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Finding that he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) could not see us very well from where he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) sat, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) got
up, and threw one leg over the back of a chair and leaned upon it; thus
having one foot on the seat of the chair, and one foot on the ground.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, Joseph Gargery, I am the bearer of an offer to relieve you of
this young fellow your apprentice. You would not object to cancel his (<font color='blue'><b>Gargery</b></font>)
indentures at his (<font color='blue'><b>Gargery</b></font>) request and for his (<font color='blue'><b>Gargery</b></font>) good? You would want nothing for
so doing?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Lord forbid that I should want anything for not standing in Pip's way,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>said Joe, staring.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Lord forbidding is pious, but not to the purpose,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jaggers/Jaggers/MR. JAGGERS</b></font>)</div>returned Mr.
Jaggers. <div class="bookquote">``The question is, Would you want anything? Do you want
anything?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The answer is,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>returned Joe, sternly, <div class="bookquote">``No.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div><p/>I thought Mr. Jaggers glanced at Joe, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) considered him (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) a fool for
his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) disinterestedness. But I was too much bewildered between breathless
curiosity and surprise, to be sure of it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jaggers/Jaggers/MR. JAGGERS</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Jaggers. <div class="bookquote">``Recollect the admission you have made,
and don't try to go from it presently.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who's a going to try?''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>retorted Joe.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't say anybody is. Do you keep a dog?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I do keep a dog.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Bear in mind then, that Brag is a good dog, but Holdfast is a better.
Bear that in mind, will you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jaggers/Jaggers/MR. JAGGERS</b></font>)</div>repeated Mr. Jaggers, shutting his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) eyes
and nodding his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) head at Joe, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) were forgiving him (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) something.
<div class="bookquote">``Now, I return to this young fellow. And the communication I have got to
make is, that he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) has great expectations.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div><p/>Joe and I gasped, and looked at one another.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am instructed to communicate to him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jaggers/Jaggers/MR. JAGGERS</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Jaggers, throwing
his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) finger at me sideways, <div class="bookquote">``that he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) will come into a handsome property.
Further, that it is the desire of the present possessor of that
property, that he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) be immediately removed from his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) present sphere of life
and from this place, and be brought up as a gentleman,--in a word, as a
young fellow of great expectations.''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>My dream was out; my wild fancy was surpassed by sober reality; Miss
Havisham was going to make my fortune on a grand scale.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, Mr. Pip,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lawyer</b></font>)</div>pursued the lawyer, <div class="bookquote">``I address the rest of what I have
to say, to you. You are to understand, first, that it is the request
of the person from whom I take my instructions that you always bear
the name of Pip. You will have no objection, I dare say, to your great
expectations being encumbered with that easy condition. But if you have
any objection, this is the time to mention it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the lawyer</b></font>)</div><p/>My heart was beating so fast, and there was such a singing in my ears,
that I could scarcely stammer I had no objection.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I should think not! Now you are to understand, secondly, Mr. Pip, that
the name of the person who is your liberal benefactor remains a profound
secret, until the person chooses to reveal it. I am empowered to mention
that it is the intention of the person to reveal it at first hand by
word of mouth to yourself. When or where that intention may be carried
out, I cannot say; no one can say. It may be years hence. Now, you are
distinctly to understand that you are most positively prohibited from
making any inquiry on this head, or any allusion or reference, however
distant, to any individual whomsoever as the individual, in all the
communications you may have with me. If you have a suspicion in your own
breast, keep that suspicion in your own breast. It is not the least to
the purpose what the reasons of this prohibition are; they may be the
strongest and gravest reasons, or they may be mere whim. This is not for
you to inquire into. The condition is laid down. Your acceptance of it,
and your observance of it as binding, is the only remaining condition
that I am charged with, by the person from whom I take my instructions,
and for whom I am not otherwise responsible. That person is the person
from whom you derive your expectations, and the secret is solely held by
that person and by me. Again, not a very difficult condition with which
to encumber such a rise in fortune; but if you have any objection to it,
this is the time to mention it. Speak out.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Once more, I stammered with difficulty that I had no objection.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I should think not! Now, Mr. Pip, I have done with stipulations.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Though he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) called me Mr. Pip, and began rather to make up to me, he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) still
could not get rid of a certain air of bullying suspicion; and even now
he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) occasionally shut his (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) eyes and threw his (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) finger at me while he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>)
spoke, as much as to express that he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) knew all kinds of things to my
disparagement, if he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) only chose to mention them. <div class="bookquote">``We come next, to mere
details of arrangement. You must know that, although I have used
the term `expectations' more than once, you are not endowed with
expectations only. There is already lodged in my hands a sum of money
amply sufficient for your suitable education and maintenance. You will
please consider me your guardian. Oh!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>for I was going to thank him (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``I
tell you at once, I am paid for my services, or I shouldn't render them.
It is considered that you must be better educated, in accordance with
your altered position, and that you will be alive to the importance and
necessity of at once entering on that advantage.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>I said I had always longed for it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Never mind what you have always longed for, Mr. Pip,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) retorted;
<div class="bookquote">``keep to the record. If you long for it now, that's enough. Am I
answered that you are ready to be placed at once under some proper
tutor? Is that it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>I stammered yes, that was it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good. Now, your inclinations are to be consulted. I don't think that
wise, mind, but it's my trust. Have you ever heard of any tutor whom you
would prefer to another?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I had never heard of any tutor but Biddy and Mr. Wopsle's great-aunt;
so, I replied in the negative.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There is a certain tutor, of whom I have some knowledge, who I think
might suit the purpose,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jaggers/Jaggers/MR. JAGGERS</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Jaggers. <div class="bookquote">``I don't recommend him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>),
observe; because I never recommend anybody. The gentleman I speak of is
one Mr. Matthew Pocket.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Ah! I caught at the name directly. Miss Havisham's relation. The Matthew
whom Mr. and Mrs. Camilla had spoken of. The Matthew whose place was to
be at Miss Havisham's head, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) lay dead, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) bride's dress on
the bride's table.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You know the name?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jaggers/Jaggers/MR. JAGGERS</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Jaggers, looking shrewdly at me, and then
shutting up his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) eyes while he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) waited for my answer.

<p/>My answer was, that I had heard of the name.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``You have heard of the name. But the question is, what do
you say of it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I said, or tried to say, that I was much obliged to him (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) for his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>)
recommendation--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, my young friend!''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) interrupted, shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) great head very
slowly. <div class="bookquote">``Recollect yourself!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Not recollecting myself, I began again that I was much obliged to him (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>)
for his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) recommendation--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, my young friend,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) interrupted, shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) head and frowning and
smiling both at once,--<div class="bookquote">``no, no, no; it's very well done, but it won't
do; you are too young to fix me with it. Recommendation is not the word,
Mr. Pip. Try another.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Correcting myself, I said that I was much obliged to him (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) for his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) mention
of Mr. Matthew Pocket--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's more like it!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Pocket/Matthew/Mr. Matthew Pocket</b></font>)</div>cried Mr. Jaggers.--And -LRB-I added-RRB-, I would
gladly try that gentleman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good. You had better try him (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) own house. The way shall be
prepared for you, and you can see his (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) son first, who is in London. When
will you come to London?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I said -LRB-glancing at Joe, who stood looking on, motionless-RRB-, that I
supposed I could come directly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``First,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jaggers/Jaggers/MR. JAGGERS</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Jaggers, <div class="bookquote">``you should have some new clothes to come in,
and they should not be working-clothes. Say this day week. You'll want
some money. Shall I leave you twenty guineas?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jaggers/Jaggers/MR. JAGGERS</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) produced a long purse, with the greatest coolness, and counted them
out on the table and pushed them over to me. This was the first time he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>)
had taken his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) leg from the chair. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) sat astride of the chair when he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>)
had pushed the money over, and sat swinging his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) purse and eyeing Joe.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, Joseph Gargery? You look dumbfoundered?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am!''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>said Joe, in a very decided manner.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It was understood that you wanted nothing for yourself, remember?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It were understood,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>said Joe. <div class="bookquote">``And it are understood. And it ever will
be similar according.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But what,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jaggers/Jaggers/MR. JAGGERS</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Jaggers, swinging his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) purse,--<div class="bookquote">``what if it was in my
instructions to make you a present, as compensation?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jaggers/Jaggers/MR. JAGGERS</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``As compensation what for?''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>Joe demanded.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``For the loss of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gargery</b></font>) services.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div><p/>Joe laid his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) hand upon my shoulder with the touch of a woman. I have
often thought him (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) since, like the steam-hammer that can crush a man or
pat an egg-shell, in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) combination of strength with gentleness. <div class="bookquote">``Pip
is that hearty welcome,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>said Joe, <div class="bookquote">``to go free with his (<font color='blue'><b>Gargery</b></font>) services, to
honor and fortun', as no words can tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Gargery</b></font>). But if you think as Money
can make compensation to me for the loss of the little child--what come
to the forge--and ever the best of friends!--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div><p/>O dear good Joe, whom I was so ready to leave and so unthankful to, I
see you again, with your muscular blacksmith's arm before your eyes,
and your broad chest heaving, and your voice dying away. O dear good
faithful tender Joe, I feel the loving tremble of your hand upon my arm,
as solemnly this day as if it had been the rustle of an angel's wing!

<p/>But I encouraged Joe at the time. I was lost in the mazes of my future
fortunes, and could not retrace the by-paths we had trodden together. I
begged Joe to be comforted, for -LRB-as he (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) said-RRB- we had ever been the best
of friends, and -LRB-as I said-RRB- we ever would be so. Joe scooped his (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) eyes
with his (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) disengaged wrist, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) were bent on gouging himself, but
said not another word.

<p/>Mr. Jaggers had looked on at this, as one who recognized in Joe the
village idiot, and in me his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) keeper. When it was over, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) said, weighing
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) hand the purse he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) had ceased to swing:--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, Joseph Gargery, I warn you this is your last chance. No half
measures with me. If you mean to take a present that I have it in charge
to make you, speak out, and you shall have it. If on the contrary you
mean to say--''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Here, to his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) great amazement, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) was stopped by Joe's
suddenly working round him (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) with every demonstration of a fell pugilistic
purpose.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Which I meantersay,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>cried Joe, <div class="bookquote">``that if you come into my place
bull-baiting and badgering me, come out! Which I meantersay as sech if
you're a man, come on! Which I meantersay that what I say, I meantersay
and stand or fall by!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div><p/>I drew Joe away, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) immediately became placable; merely stating to
me, in an obliging manner and as a polite expostulatory notice to any
one whom it might happen to concern, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) were not a going to be
bull-baited and badgered in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) own place. Mr. Jaggers had risen when
Joe demonstrated, and had backed near the door. Without evincing
any inclination to come in again, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) there delivered his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) valedictory
remarks. They were these.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, Mr. Pip, I think the sooner you leave here--as you are to be a
gentleman--the better. Let it stand for this day week, and you shall
receive my printed address in the meantime. You can take a hackney-coach
at the stage-coach office in London, and come straight to me.
Understand, that I express no opinion, one way or other, on the trust
I undertake. I am paid for undertaking it, and I do so. Now, understand
that, finally. Understand that!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) was throwing his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) finger at both of us, and I think would have gone
on, but for his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) seeming to think Joe dangerous, and going off.

<p/>Something came into my head which induced me to run after him (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>), as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) was
going down to the Jolly Bargemen, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) had left a hired carriage.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I beg your pardon, Mr. Jaggers.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Halloa!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>), facing round, <div class="bookquote">``what's the matter?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish to be quite right, Mr. Jaggers, and to keep to your directions;
so I thought I had better ask. Would there be any objection to my taking
leave of any one I know, about here, before I go away?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>), looking as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) hardly understood me.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't mean in the village only, but up town?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``No objection.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I thanked him (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) and ran home again, and there I found that Joe had already
locked the front door and vacated the state parlor, and was seated
by the kitchen fire with a hand on each knee, gazing intently at the
burning coals. I too sat down before the fire and gazed at the coals,
and nothing was said for a long time.

<p/>My sister was in her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) cushioned chair in her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) corner, and Biddy sat at her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)
needle-work before the fire, and Joe sat next Biddy, and I sat next Joe
in the corner opposite my sister. The more I looked into the glowing
coals, the more incapable I became of looking at Joe; the longer the
silence lasted, the more unable I felt to speak.

<p/>At length I got out, <div class="bookquote">``Joe, have you told Biddy?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, Pip,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>returned Joe, still looking at the fire, and holding his (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>)
knees tight, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) had private information that they intended to make
off somewhere, <div class="bookquote">``which I left it to yourself, Pip.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I would rather you told, Joe.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pip's a gentleman of fortun' then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>said Joe, <div class="bookquote">``and God bless him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) in
it!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div><p/>Biddy dropped her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) work, and looked at me. Joe held his (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) knees and looked
at me. I looked at both of them. After a pause, they both heartily
congratulated me; but there was a certain touch of sadness in their
congratulations that I rather resented.

<p/>I took it upon myself to impress Biddy -LRB-and through Biddy, Joe-RRB- with the
grave obligation I considered my friends under, to know nothing and say
nothing about the maker of my fortune. It would all come out in good
time, I observed, and in the meanwhile nothing was to be said, save
that I had come into great expectations from a mysterious patron. Biddy
nodded her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) head thoughtfully at the fire as she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) took up her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) work again,
and said she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) would be very particular; and Joe, still detaining his (<font color='blue'><b>patron</b></font>)
knees, said, <div class="bookquote">``Ay, ay, I'll be ekervally partickler, Pip;''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>and then they
congratulated me again, and went on to express so much wonder at the
notion of my being a gentleman that I didn't half like it.

<p/>Infinite pains were then taken by Biddy to convey to my sister some idea
of what had happened. To the best of my belief, those efforts entirely
failed. She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) laughed and nodded her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) head a great many times, and even
repeated after Biddy, the words <div class="bookquote">``Pip''  (<font color='red'><b>Biddy</b></font>)</div>and <div class="bookquote">``Property.''  (<font color='red'><b>Biddy</b></font>)</div>But I doubt if
they had more meaning in them than an election cry, and I cannot suggest
a darker picture of her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) state of mind.

<p/>I never could have believed it without experience, but as Joe and
Biddy became more at their cheerful ease again, I became quite gloomy.
Dissatisfied with my fortune, of course I could not be; but it is
possible that I may have been, without quite knowing it, dissatisfied
with myself.

<p/>Any how, I sat with my elbow on my knee and my face upon my hand,
looking into the fire, as those two talked about my going away, and
about what they should do without me, and all that. And whenever I
caught one of them looking at me, though never so pleasantly -LRB-and they
often looked at me,--particularly Biddy-RRB-, I felt offended: as if they
were expressing some mistrust of me. Though Heaven knows they never did
by word or sign.

<p/>At those times I would get up and look out at the door; for our kitchen
door opened at once upon the night, and stood open on summer evenings to
air the room. The very stars to which I then raised my eyes, I am afraid
I took to be but poor and humble stars for glittering on the rustic
objects among which I had passed my life.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Saturday night,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, when we sat at our supper of bread and cheese
and beer. <div class="bookquote">``Five more days, and then the day before the day! They'll soon
go.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Pip,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>observed Joe, whose voice sounded hollow in his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) beer-mug.
<div class="bookquote">``They'll soon go.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Soon, soon go,''  (<font color='red'><b>Biddy</b></font>)</div>said Biddy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have been thinking, Joe, that when I go down town on Monday, and
order my new clothes, I shall tell the tailor that I'll come and put
them on there, or that I'll have them sent to Mr. Pumblechook's. It
would be very disagreeable to be stared at by all the people here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. and Mrs. Hubble might like to see you in your new gen-teel figure
too, Pip,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>said Joe, industriously cutting his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) bread, with his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) cheese on
it, in the palm of his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) left hand, and glancing at my untasted supper
as if he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) thought of the time when we used to compare slices. <div class="bookquote">``So might
Wopsle. And the Jolly Bargemen might take it as a compliment.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's just what I don't want, Joe. They would make such a business of
it,--such a coarse and common business,--that I couldn't bear myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, that indeed, Pip!''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>said Joe. <div class="bookquote">``If you couldn't abear yourself--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Biddy</b></font>)</div><p/>Biddy asked me here, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) sat holding my sister's plate, <div class="bookquote">``Have you
thought about when you'll show yourself to Mr. Gargery, and your sister
and me? You will show yourself to us; won't you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Biddy,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I returned with some resentment, <div class="bookquote">``you are so exceedingly quick
that it's difficult to keep up with you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>-LRB-<div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) always were quick,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>observed Joe.-RRB-

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you had waited another moment, Biddy, you would have heard me say
that I shall bring my clothes here in a bundle one evening,--most likely
on the evening before I go away.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Biddy</b></font>)</div><p/>Biddy said no more. Handsomely forgiving her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>), I soon exchanged an
affectionate good night with her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) and Joe, and went up to bed. When I got
into my little room, I sat down and took a long look at it, as a mean
little room that I should soon be parted from and raised above, for
ever. It was furnished with fresh young remembrances too, and even at
the same moment I fell into much the same confused division of mind
between it and the better rooms to which I was going, as I had been in
so often between the forge and Miss Havisham's, and Biddy and Estella.

<p/>The sun had been shining brightly all day on the roof of my attic, and
the room was warm. As I put the window open and stood looking out, I saw
Joe come slowly forth at the dark door, below, and take a turn or two
in the air; and then I saw Biddy come, and bring him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) a pipe and light
it for him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) never smoked so late, and it seemed to hint to me that he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)
wanted comforting, for some reason or other.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) presently stood at the door immediately beneath me, smoking his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) pipe,
and Biddy stood there too, quietly talking to him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), and I knew that they
talked of me, for I heard my name mentioned in an endearing tone by both
of them more than once. I would not have listened for more, if I could
have heard more; so I drew away from the window, and sat down in my one
chair by the bedside, feeling it very sorrowful and strange that this
first night of my bright fortunes should be the loneliest I had ever
known.

<p/>Looking towards the open window, I saw light wreaths from Joe's pipe
floating there, and I fancied it was like a blessing from Joe,--not
obtruded on me or paraded before me, but pervading the air we shared
together. I put my light out, and crept into bed; and it was an uneasy
bed now, and I never slept the old sound sleep in it any more.




<p/>Chapter XIX

<p/>Morning made a considerable difference in my general prospect of Life,
and brightened it so much that it scarcely seemed the same. What lay
heaviest on my mind was, the consideration that six days intervened
between me and the day of departure; for I could not divest myself of
a misgiving that something might happen to London in the meanwhile, and
that, when I got there, it would be either greatly deteriorated or clean
gone.

<p/>Joe and Biddy were very sympathetic and pleasant when I spoke of our
approaching separation; but they only referred to it when I did. After
breakfast, Joe brought out my indentures from the press in the best
parlor, and we put them in the fire, and I felt that I was free. With
all the novelty of my emancipation on me, I went to church with Joe, and
thought perhaps the clergyman wouldn't have read that about the rich man
and the kingdom of Heaven, if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had known all.

<p/>After our early dinner, I strolled out alone, purposing to finish off
the marshes at once, and get them done with. As I passed the church, I
felt -LRB-as I had felt during service in the morning-RRB- a sublime compassion
for the poor creatures who were destined to go there, Sunday after
Sunday, all their lives through, and to lie obscurely at last among the
low green mounds. I promised myself that I would do something for them
one of these days, and formed a plan in outline for bestowing a
dinner of roast-beef and plum-pudding, a pint of ale, and a gallon of
condescension, upon everybody in the village.

<p/>If I had often thought before, with something allied to shame, of my
companionship with the fugitive whom I had once seen limping among those
graves, what were my thoughts on this Sunday, when the place recalled
the wretch, ragged and shivering, with his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) felon iron and badge! My
comfort was, that it happened a long time ago, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) had doubtless
been transported a long way off, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) was dead to me, and might
be veritably dead into the bargain.

<p/>No more low, wet grounds, no more dikes and sluices, no more of these
grazing cattle,--though they seemed, in their dull manner, to wear a
more respectful air now, and to face round, in order that they
might stare as long as possible at the possessor of such great
expectations,--farewell, monotonous acquaintances of my childhood,
henceforth I was for London and greatness; not for smith's work in
general, and for you! I made my exultant way to the old Battery, and,
lying down there to consider the question whether Miss Havisham intended
me for Estella, fell asleep.

<p/>When I awoke, I was much surprised to find Joe sitting beside me,
smoking his (<font color='blue'><b>smith</b></font>) pipe. He (<font color='blue'><b>smith</b></font>) greeted me with a cheerful smile on my opening my
eyes, and said,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``As being the last time, Pip, I thought I'd foller.''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And Joe, I am very glad you did so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thankee, Pip.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You may be sure, dear Joe,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I went on, after we had shaken hands, <div class="bookquote">``that
I shall never forget you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no, Pip!''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>said Joe, in a comfortable tone, <div class="bookquote">``I'm sure of that. Ay,
ay, old chap! Bless you, it were only necessary to get it well round in
a man's mind, to be certain on it. But it took a bit of time to get it
well round, the change come so oncommon plump; didn't it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div><p/>Somehow, I was not best pleased with Joe's being so mightily secure of
me. I should have liked him (<font color='blue'><b>smith</b></font>) to have betrayed emotion, or to have said,
<div class="bookquote">``It does you credit, Pip,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>or something of that sort. Therefore, I made
no remark on Joe's first head; merely saying as to his (<font color='blue'><b>smith</b></font>) second, that the
tidings had indeed come suddenly, but that I had always wanted to be a
gentleman, and had often and often speculated on what I would do, if I
were one.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you though?''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>said Joe. <div class="bookquote">``Astonishing!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's a pity now, Joe,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, <div class="bookquote">``that you did not get on a little more,
when we had our lessons here; isn't it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I don't know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>returned Joe. <div class="bookquote">``I'm so awful dull. I'm only master
of my own trade. It were always a pity as I was so awful dull; but it's
no more of a pity now, than it was--this day twelvemonth--don't you
see?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>What I had meant was, that when I came into my property and was able to
do something for Joe, it would have been much more agreeable if he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
had been better qualified for a rise in station. He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was so perfectly
innocent of my meaning, however, that I thought I would mention it to
Biddy in preference.

<p/>So, when we had walked home and had had tea, I took Biddy into our
little garden by the side of the lane, and, after throwing out in a
general way for the elevation of her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) spirits, that I should never forget
her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>), said I had a favor to ask of her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And it is, Biddy,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, <div class="bookquote">``that you will not omit any opportunity of
helping Joe on, a little.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How helping him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) on?''  (<font color='red'><b>Biddy</b></font>)</div>asked Biddy, with a steady sort of glance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well! Joe is a dear good fellow,--in fact, I think he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) is the dearest
fellow that ever lived,--but he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) is rather backward in some things. For
instance, Biddy, in his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) learning and his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) manners.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Although I was looking at Biddy as I spoke, and although she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) opened her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>)
eyes very wide when I had spoken, she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) did not look at me.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``O, his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) manners! won't his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) manners do then?''  (<font color='red'><b>Biddy</b></font>)</div>asked Biddy, plucking a
black-currant leaf.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear Biddy, they do very well here--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``O! they do very well here?''  (<font color='red'><b>Biddy</b></font>)</div>interrupted Biddy, looking closely at the
leaf in her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hear me out,--but if I were to remove Joe into a higher sphere, as I
shall hope to remove him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) when I fully come into my property, they would
hardly do him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) justice.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And don't you think he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) knows that?''  (<font color='red'><b>Biddy</b></font>)</div>asked Biddy.

<p/>It was such a very provoking question -LRB-for it had never in the most
distant manner occurred to me-RRB-, that I said, snappishly,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Biddy, what do you mean?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Biddy, having rubbed the leaf to pieces between her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) hands,--and the
smell of a black-currant bush has ever since recalled to me that evening
in the little garden by the side of the lane,--said, <div class="bookquote">``Have you never
considered that he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) may be proud?''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Proud?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I repeated, with disdainful emphasis.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``O! there are many kinds of pride,''  (<font color='red'><b>Biddy</b></font>)</div>said Biddy, looking full at me and
shaking her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) head; <div class="bookquote">``pride is not all of one kind--''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well? What are you stopping for?''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>said I.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not all of one kind,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>resumed Biddy. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) may be too proud to let any
one take him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) out of a place that he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) is competent to fill, and fills well
and with respect. To tell you the truth, I think he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) is; though it sounds
bold in me to say so, for you must know him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) far better than I do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, Biddy,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, <div class="bookquote">``I am very sorry to see this in you. I did not
expect to see this in you. You are envious, Biddy, and grudging. You
are dissatisfied on account of my rise in fortune, and you can't help
showing it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you have the heart to think so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Biddy</b></font>)</div>returned Biddy, <div class="bookquote">``say so. Say so
over and over again, if you have the heart to think so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Biddy</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you have the heart to be so, you mean, Biddy,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, in a virtuous
and superior tone; <div class="bookquote">``don't put it off upon me. I am very sorry to see it,
and it's a--it's a bad side of human nature. I did intend to ask you
to use any little opportunities you might have after I was gone, of
improving dear Joe. But after this I ask you nothing. I am extremely
sorry to see this in you, Biddy,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I repeated. <div class="bookquote">``It's a--it's a bad side
of human nature.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Whether you scold me or approve of me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Biddy</b></font>)</div>returned poor Biddy, <div class="bookquote">``you may
equally depend upon my trying to do all that lies in my power, here,
at all times. And whatever opinion you take away of me, shall make
no difference in my remembrance of you. Yet a gentleman should not be
unjust neither,''  (<font color='red'><b>Biddy</b></font>)</div>said Biddy, turning away her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) head.

<p/>I again warmly repeated that it was a bad side of human nature -LRB-in which
sentiment, waiving its application, I have since seen reason to think I
was right-RRB-, and I walked down the little path away from Biddy, and
Biddy went into the house, and I went out at the garden gate and took a
dejected stroll until supper-time; again feeling it very sorrowful and
strange that this, the second night of my bright fortunes, should be as
lonely and unsatisfactory as the first.

<p/>But, morning once more brightened my view, and I extended my clemency to
Biddy, and we dropped the subject. Putting on the best clothes I had,
I went into town as early as I could hope to find the shops open,
and presented myself before Mr. Trabb, the tailor, who was having his (<font color='blue'><b>Trabb</b></font>)
breakfast in the parlor behind his (<font color='blue'><b>Trabb</b></font>) shop, and who did not think it worth
his (<font color='blue'><b>Trabb</b></font>) while to come out to me, but called me into him (<font color='blue'><b>Trabb</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Trabb/Trabb</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Trabb, in a hail-fellow-well-met kind of way. <div class="bookquote">``How are
you, and what can I do for you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Trabb/Trabb</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Trabb had sliced his (<font color='blue'><b>Trabb</b></font>) hot roll into three feather-beds, and was
slipping butter in between the blankets, and covering it up. He (<font color='blue'><b>Trabb</b></font>) was a
prosperous old bachelor, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Trabb</b></font>) open window looked into a prosperous
little garden and orchard, and there was a prosperous iron safe let into
the wall at the side of his (<font color='blue'><b>Trabb</b></font>) fireplace, and I did not doubt that heaps of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Trabb</b></font>) prosperity were put away in it in bags.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Trabb,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, <div class="bookquote">``it's an unpleasant thing to have to mention,
because it looks like boasting; but I have come into a handsome
property.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>A change passed over Mr. Trabb. He (<font color='blue'><b>Trabb</b></font>) forgot the butter in bed, got up from
the bedside, and wiped his (<font color='blue'><b>Trabb</b></font>) fingers on the tablecloth, exclaiming, <div class="bookquote">``Lord
bless my soul!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am going up to my guardian in London,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, casually drawing some
guineas out of my pocket and looking at them; <div class="bookquote">``and I want a fashionable
suit of clothes to go in. I wish to pay for them,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I added--otherwise I
thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Trabb</b></font>) might only pretend to make them, <div class="bookquote">``with ready money.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Trabb/Trabb</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Trabb, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Trabb</b></font>) respectfully bent his (<font color='blue'><b>Trabb</b></font>) body, opened
his (<font color='blue'><b>Trabb</b></font>) arms, and took the liberty of touching me on the outside of each
elbow, <div class="bookquote">``don't hurt me by mentioning that. May I venture to congratulate
you? Would you do me the favor of stepping into the shop?''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Trabb's boy was the most audacious boy in all that country-side.
When I had entered he (<font color='blue'><b>Trabb</b></font>) was sweeping the shop, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Trabb</b></font>) had sweetened his (<font color='blue'><b>Trabb</b></font>)
labors by sweeping over me. He (<font color='blue'><b>Trabb</b></font>) was still sweeping when I came out into
the shop with Mr. Trabb, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Trabb</b></font>) knocked the broom against all possible
corners and obstacles, to express -LRB-as I understood it-RRB- equality with any
blacksmith, alive or dead.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hold that noise,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Trabb/Trabb</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Trabb, with the greatest sternness, <div class="bookquote">``or I'll
knock your head off!--Do me the favor to be seated, sir. Now, this,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Trabb/Trabb</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Trabb, taking down a roll of cloth, and tiding it out in a
flowing manner over the counter, preparatory to getting his (<font color='blue'><b>Trabb</b></font>) hand under
it to show the gloss, <div class="bookquote">``is a very sweet article. I can recommend it for
your purpose, sir, because it really is extra super. But you shall
see some others. Give me Number Four, you!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Trabb/Trabb</b></font>)</div>-LRB-To the boy, and with a
dreadfully severe stare; foreseeing the danger of that miscreant's
brushing me with it, or making some other sign of familiarity.-RRB-

<p/>Mr. Trabb never removed his (<font color='blue'><b>Trabb</b></font>) stern eye from the boy until he (<font color='blue'><b>Trabb</b></font>) had
deposited number four on the counter and was at a safe distance again.
Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Trabb</b></font>) commanded him (<font color='blue'><b>Trabb</b></font>) to bring number five, and number eight. <div class="bookquote">``And let
me have none of your tricks here,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Trabb/Trabb</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Trabb, <div class="bookquote">``or you shall repent
it, you young scoundrel, the longest day you have to live.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Trabb/Trabb</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Trabb then bent over number four, and in a sort of deferential
confidence recommended it to me as a light article for summer wear, an
article much in vogue among the nobility and gentry, an article that
it would ever be an honor to him (<font color='blue'><b>gentry</b></font>) to reflect upon a distinguished
fellow-townsman's -LRB-if he (<font color='blue'><b>gentry</b></font>) might claim me for a fellow-townsman-RRB- having
worn. <div class="bookquote">``Are you bringing numbers five and eight, you vagabond,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Trabb/Trabb</b></font>)</div>said Mr.
Trabb to the boy after that, <div class="bookquote">``or shall I kick you out of the shop and
bring them myself?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div><p/>I selected the materials for a suit, with the assistance of Mr. Trabb's
judgment, and re-entered the parlor to be measured. For although Mr.
Trabb had my measure already, and had previously been quite contented
with it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Trabb</b></font>) said apologetically that it <div class="bookquote">``wouldn't do under existing
circumstances, sir,--wouldn't do at all.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>So, Mr. Trabb measured and
calculated me in the parlor, as if I were an estate and he (<font color='blue'><b>Trabb</b></font>) the finest
species of surveyor, and gave himself such a world of trouble that
I felt that no suit of clothes could possibly remunerate him (<font color='blue'><b>Trabb</b></font>) for his (<font color='blue'><b>Trabb</b></font>)
pains. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Trabb</b></font>) had at last done and had appointed to send the articles
to Mr. Pumblechook's on the Thursday evening, he (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) said, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) hand
upon the parlor lock, <div class="bookquote">``I know, sir, that London gentlemen cannot be
expected to patronize local work, as a rule; but if you would give me a
turn now and then in the quality of a townsman, I should greatly esteem
it. Good morning, sir, much obliged.--Door!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The last word was flung at the boy, who had not the least notion what
it meant. But I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) collapse as his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) master rubbed me out with his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
hands, and my first decided experience of the stupendous power of money
was, that it had morally laid upon his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) back Trabb's boy.

<p/>After this memorable event, I went to the hatter's, and the bootmaker's,
and the hosier's, and felt rather like Mother Hubbard's dog whose outfit
required the services of so many trades. I also went to the coach-office
and took my place for seven o’clock on Saturday morning. It was
not necessary to explain everywhere that I had come into a handsome
property; but whenever I said anything to that effect, it followed that
the officiating tradesman ceased to have his (<font color='blue'><b>tradesman</b></font>) attention diverted through
the window by the High Street, and concentrated his (<font color='blue'><b>tradesman</b></font>) mind upon me. When
I had ordered everything I wanted, I directed my steps towards
Pumblechook's, and, as I approached that gentleman's place of business,
I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) standing at his (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) door.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) was waiting for me with great impatience. He (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) had been out early with
the chaise-cart, and had called at the forge and heard the news. He (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) had
prepared a collation for me in the Barnwell parlor, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Barnwell</b></font>) too ordered
his (<font color='blue'><b>Barnwell</b></font>) shopman to <div class="bookquote">``come out of the gangway''  (<font color='red'><b>shopman</b></font>)</div>as my sacred person passed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear friend,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Pumblechook/Pumblechook</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Pumblechook, taking me by both hands, when
he (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) and I and the collation were alone, <div class="bookquote">``I give you joy of your good
fortune. Well deserved, well deserved!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>This was coming to the point, and I thought it a sensible way of
expressing himself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``To think,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Pumblechook/Pumblechook</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Pumblechook, after snorting admiration at me for
some moments, <div class="bookquote">``that I should have been the humble instrument of leading
up to this, is a proud reward.''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>I begged Mr. Pumblechook to remember that nothing was to be ever said or
hinted, on that point.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear young friend,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Pumblechook/Pumblechook</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Pumblechook; <div class="bookquote">``if you will allow me to
call you so--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Pumblechook/Pumblechook</b></font>)</div><p/>I murmured <div class="bookquote">``Certainly,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>and Mr. Pumblechook took me by both hands again,
and communicated a movement to his (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) waistcoat, which had an emotional
appearance, though it was rather low down, <div class="bookquote">``My dear young friend, rely
upon my doing my little all in your absence, by keeping the fact before
the mind of Joseph.--Joseph!''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Pumblechook, in the way of a
compassionate adjuration. <div class="bookquote">``Joseph!! Joseph!!!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Thereupon he (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>)
head and tapped it, expressing his (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) sense of deficiency in Joseph.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But my dear young friend,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Pumblechook/Pumblechook</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Pumblechook, <div class="bookquote">``you must be hungry,
you must be exhausted. Be seated. Here is a chicken had round from the
Boar, here is a tongue had round from the Boar, here's one or two little
things had round from the Boar, that I hope you may not despise. But do
I,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Pumblechook/Pumblechook</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Pumblechook, getting up again the moment after he (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) had sat
down, <div class="bookquote">``see afore me, him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) as I ever sported with in his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) times of happy
infancy? And may I--may I--?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>This May I, meant might he (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) shake hands? I consented, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) was fervent,
and then sat down again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here is wine,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Pumblechook/Pumblechook</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Pumblechook. <div class="bookquote">``Let us drink, Thanks to Fortune,
and may she (<font color='blue'><b>Boar</b></font>) ever pick out her (<font color='blue'><b>Boar</b></font>) favorites with equal judgment! And yet I
cannot,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Pumblechook/Pumblechook</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Pumblechook, getting up again, <div class="bookquote">``see afore me One--and
likewise drink to One--without again expressing--May I--may I--?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Pumblechook/Pumblechook</b></font>)</div><p/>I said he (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) might, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) shook hands with me again, and emptied his (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) glass
and turned it upside down. I did the same; and if I had turned myself
upside down before drinking, the wine could not have gone more direct to
my head.

<p/>Mr. Pumblechook helped me to the liver wing, and to the best slice of
tongue -LRB-none of those out-of-the-way No Thoroughfares of Pork now-RRB-, and
took, comparatively speaking, no care of himself at all. <div class="bookquote">``Ah! poultry,
poultry! You little thought,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Pumblechook/Pumblechook</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Pumblechook, apostrophizing the
fowl in the dish, <div class="bookquote">``when you was a young fledgling, what was in store for
you. You little thought you was to be refreshment beneath this humble
roof for one as--Call it a weakness, if you will,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Pumblechook/Pumblechook</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Pumblechook,
getting up again, <div class="bookquote">``but may I? may I--?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Pumblechook/Pumblechook</b></font>)</div><p/>It began to be unnecessary to repeat the form of saying he (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) might, so
he (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) did it at once. How he (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) ever did it so often without wounding himself
with my knife, I don't know.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And your sister,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) resumed, after a little steady eating, <div class="bookquote">``which had
the honor of bringing you up by hand! It's a sad picter, to reflect that
she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)'s no longer equal to fully understanding the honor. May--''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>I saw he (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) was about to come at me again, and I stopped him (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We'll drink her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) health,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah!''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>cried Mr. Pumblechook, leaning back in his (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) chair, quite flaccid
with admiration, <div class="bookquote">``that's the way you know `em, sir!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Pumblechook/Pumblechook</b></font>)</div>-LRB-I don't know
who Sir was, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) certainly was not I, and there was no third person
present-RRB-; <div class="bookquote">``that's the way you know the noble-minded, sir! Ever forgiving
and ever affable. It might,''  (<font color='red'><b>no person</b></font>)</div>said the servile Pumblechook, putting down
his (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) untasted glass in a hurry and getting up again, <div class="bookquote">``to a common person,
have the appearance of repeating--but may I--?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Pumblechook/Pumblechook</b></font>)</div><p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) had done it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) resumed his (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) seat and drank to my sister. <div class="bookquote">``Let us
never be blind,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Pumblechook/Pumblechook</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Pumblechook, <div class="bookquote">``to her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) faults of temper, but it
is to be hoped she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) meant well.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Pumblechook/Pumblechook</b></font>)</div><p/>At about this time, I began to observe that he (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) was getting flushed in
the face; as to myself, I felt all face, steeped in wine and smarting.

<p/>I mentioned to Mr. Pumblechook that I wished to have my new clothes
sent to his (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) house, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) was ecstatic on my so distinguishing him (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>). I
mentioned my reason for desiring to avoid observation in the village,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) lauded it to the skies. There was nobody but himself, he (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>)
intimated, worthy of my confidence, and--in short, might he (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>)? Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>)
asked me tenderly if I remembered our boyish games at sums, and how we
had gone together to have me bound apprentice, and, in effect, how he (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>)
had ever been my favorite fancy and my chosen friend? If I had taken
ten times as many glasses of wine as I had, I should have known that he (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>)
never had stood in that relation towards me, and should in my heart of
hearts have repudiated the idea. Yet for all that, I remember feeling
convinced that I had been much mistaken in him (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>), and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) was a
sensible, practical, good-hearted prime fellow.

<p/>By degrees he (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) fell to reposing such great confidence in me, as to ask my
advice in reference to his (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) own affairs. He (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) mentioned that there was an
opportunity for a great amalgamation and monopoly of the corn and seed
trade on those premises, if enlarged, such as had never occurred
before in that or any other neighborhood. What alone was wanting to the
realization of a vast fortune, he (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) considered to be More Capital.
Those were the two little words, more capital. Now it appeared to him (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>)
-LRB-Pumblechook-RRB- that if that capital were got into the business, through a
sleeping partner, sir,--which sleeping partner would have nothing to
do but walk in, by self or deputy, whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>deputy</b></font>) pleased, and examine
the books,--and walk in twice a year and take his (<font color='blue'><b>deputy</b></font>) profits away in his (<font color='blue'><b>deputy</b></font>)
pocket, to the tune of fifty per cent,--it appeared to him (<font color='blue'><b>deputy</b></font>) that that
might be an opening for a young gentleman of spirit combined with
property, which would be worthy of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) attention. But what did I think?
He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had great confidence in my opinion, and what did I think? I gave it
as my opinion. <div class="bookquote">``Wait a bit!''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>The united vastness and distinctness of
this view so struck him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>), that he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) no longer asked if he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) might shake hands
with me, but said he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) really must,--and did.

<p/>We drank all the wine, and Mr. Pumblechook pledged himself over and over
again to keep Joseph up to the mark -LRB-I don't know what mark-RRB-, and to
render me efficient and constant service -LRB-I don't know what service-RRB-. He (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>)
also made known to me for the first time in my life, and certainly after
having kept his (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) secret wonderfully well, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) had always said of me,
<div class="bookquote">``That boy is no common boy, and mark me, his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) fortun' will be no common
fortun'.''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) said with a tearful smile that it was a singular thing to
think of now, and I said so too. Finally, I went out into the air, with
a dim perception that there was something unwonted in the conduct of the
sunshine, and found that I had slumberously got to the turnpike without
having taken any account of the road.

<p/>There, I was roused by Mr. Pumblechook's hailing me. He (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) was a long way
down the sunny street, and was making expressive gestures for me to
stop. I stopped, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) came up breathless.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, my dear friend,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>), when he (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) had recovered wind for speech.
<div class="bookquote">``Not if I can help it. This occasion shall not entirely pass without
that affability on your part.--May I, as an old friend and well-wisher?
May I?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>We shook hands for the hundredth time at least, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) ordered a young
carter out of my way with the greatest indignation. Then, he (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) blessed
me and stood waving his (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) hand to me until I had passed the crook in the
road; and then I turned into a field and had a long nap under a hedge
before I pursued my way home.

<p/>I had scant luggage to take with me to London, for little of the little
I possessed was adapted to my new station. But I began packing that same
afternoon, and wildly packed up things that I knew I should want next
morning, in a fiction that there was not a moment to be lost.

<p/>So, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday, passed; and on Friday morning I
went to Mr. Pumblechook's, to put on my new clothes and pay my visit to
Miss Havisham. Mr. Pumblechook's own room was given up to me to dress
in, and was decorated with clean towels expressly for the event. My
clothes were rather a disappointment, of course. Probably every new
and eagerly expected garment ever put on since clothes came in, fell
a trifle short of the wearer's expectation. But after I had had my
new suit on some half an hour, and had gone through an immensity of
posturing with Mr. Pumblechook's very limited dressing-glass, in the
futile endeavor to see my legs, it seemed to fit me better. It being
market morning at a neighboring town some ten miles off, Mr. Pumblechook
was not at home. I had not told him (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) exactly when I meant to leave, and
was not likely to shake hands with him (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) again before departing. This was
all as it should be, and I went out in my new array, fearfully ashamed
of having to pass the shopman, and suspicious after all that I was at a
personal disadvantage, something like Joe's in his (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) Sunday suit.

<p/>I went circuitously to Miss Havisham's by all the back ways, and rang
at the bell constrainedly, on account of the stiff long fingers of my
gloves. Sarah Pocket came to the gate, and positively reeled back when
she (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) saw me so changed; her (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) walnut-shell countenance likewise turned from
brown to green and yellow.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``You? Good gracious! What do you want?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am going to London, Miss Pocket,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, <div class="bookquote">``and want to say good-bye to
Miss Havisham.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I was not expected, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) left me locked in the yard, while she (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) went
to ask if I were to be admitted. After a very short delay, she (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) returned
and took me up, staring at me all the way.

<p/>Miss Havisham was taking exercise in the room with the long spread
table, leaning on her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) crutch stick. The room was lighted as of yore, and
at the sound of our entrance, she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) stopped and turned. She (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) was then just
abreast of the rotted bride-cake.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't go, Sarah,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Well, Pip?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I start for London, Miss Havisham, to-morrow,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I was exceedingly
careful what I said, <div class="bookquote">``and I thought you would kindly not mind my taking
leave of you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``This is a gay figure, Pip,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>), making her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) crutch stick play
round me, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>), the fairy godmother who had changed me, were
bestowing the finishing gift.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have come into such good fortune since I saw you last, Miss
Havisham,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I murmured. <div class="bookquote">``And I am so grateful for it, Miss Havisham!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, ay!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>), looking at the discomfited and envious Sarah, with
delight. <div class="bookquote">``I have seen Mr. Jaggers. I have heard about it, Pip. So you go
to-morrow?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Miss Havisham.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you are adopted by a rich person?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Miss Havisham.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not named?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, Miss Havisham.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And Mr. Jaggers is made your guardian?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Miss Havisham.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) quite gloated on these questions and answers, so keen was her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>)
enjoyment of Sarah Pocket's jealous dismay. <div class="bookquote">``Well!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) went on; <div class="bookquote">``you
have a promising career before you. Be good--deserve it--and abide by
Mr. Jaggers's instructions.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) looked at me, and looked at Sarah, and
Sarah's countenance wrung out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) watchful face a cruel smile. <div class="bookquote">``Good-bye,
Pip!--you will always keep the name of Pip, you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Miss Havisham.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good-bye, Pip!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) stretched out her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) hand, and I went down on my knee and put it to
my lips. I had not considered how I should take leave of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>); it came
naturally to me at the moment to do this. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) looked at Sarah Pocket
with triumph in her (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) weird eyes, and so I left my fairy godmother, with
both her (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) hands on her (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) crutch stick, standing in the midst of the dimly
lighted room beside the rotten bride-cake that was hidden in cobwebs.

<p/>Sarah Pocket conducted me down, as if I were a ghost who must be seen
out. She (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) could not get over my appearance, and was in the last degree
confounded. I said <div class="bookquote">``Good-bye, Miss Pocket;''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>but she (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) merely stared, and
did not seem collected enough to know that I had spoken. Clear of the
house, I made the best of my way back to Pumblechook's, took off my new
clothes, made them into a bundle, and went back home in my older dress,
carrying it--to speak the truth--much more at my ease too, though I had
the bundle to carry.

<p/>And now, those six days which were to have run out so slowly, had
run out fast and were gone, and to-morrow looked me in the face more
steadily than I could look at it. As the six evenings had dwindled
away, to five, to four, to three, to two, I had become more and more
appreciative of the society of Joe and Biddy. On this last evening, I
dressed my self out in my new clothes for their delight, and sat in my
splendor until bedtime. We had a hot supper on the occasion, graced by
the inevitable roast fowl, and we had some flip to finish with. We were
all very low, and none the higher for pretending to be in spirits.

<p/>I was to leave our village at five in the morning, carrying my little
hand-portmanteau, and I had told Joe that I wished to walk away all
alone. I am afraid--sore afraid--that this purpose originated in my
sense of the contrast there would be between me and Joe, if we went to
the coach together. I had pretended with myself that there was nothing
of this taint in the arrangement; but when I went up to my little room
on this last night, I felt compelled to admit that it might be so, and
had an impulse upon me to go down again and entreat Joe to walk with me
in the morning. I did not.

<p/>All night there were coaches in my broken sleep, going to wrong places
instead of to London, and having in the traces, now dogs, now cats, now
pigs, now men,--never horses. Fantastic failures of journeys occupied
me until the day dawned and the birds were singing. Then, I got up and
partly dressed, and sat at the window to take a last look out, and in
taking it fell asleep.

<p/>Biddy was astir so early to get my breakfast, that, although I did not
sleep at the window an hour, I smelt the smoke of the kitchen fire when
I started up with a terrible idea that it must be late in the afternoon.
But long after that, and long after I had heard the clinking of the
teacups and was quite ready, I wanted the resolution to go downstairs.
After all, I remained up there, repeatedly unlocking and unstrapping
my small portmanteau and locking and strapping it up again, until Biddy
called to me that I was late.

<p/>It was a hurried breakfast with no taste in it. I got up from the meal,
saying with a sort of briskness, as if it had only just occurred to me,
<div class="bookquote">``Well! I suppose I must be off!''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>and then I kissed my sister who was
laughing and nodding and shaking in her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) usual chair, and kissed
Biddy, and threw my arms around Joe's neck. Then I took up my little
portmanteau and walked out. The last I saw of them was, when I presently
heard a scuffle behind me, and looking back, saw Joe throwing an old
shoe after me and Biddy throwing another old shoe. I stopped then, to
wave my hat, and dear old Joe waved his (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) strong right arm above his (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) head,
crying huskily <div class="bookquote">``Hooroar!''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>and Biddy put her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) apron to her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) face.

<p/>I walked away at a good pace, thinking it was easier to go than I had
supposed it would be, and reflecting that it would never have done to
have had an old shoe thrown after the coach, in sight of all the High
Street. I whistled and made nothing of going. But the village was very
peaceful and quiet, and the light mists were solemnly rising, as if to
show me the world, and I had been so innocent and little there, and all
beyond was so unknown and great, that in a moment with a strong heave
and sob I broke into tears. It was by the finger-post at the end of the
village, and I laid my hand upon it, and said, <div class="bookquote">``Good-bye, O my dear, dear
friend!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Heaven knows we need never be ashamed of our tears, for they are rain
upon the blinding dust of earth, overlying our hard hearts. I was
better after I had cried than before,--more sorry, more aware of my own
ingratitude, more gentle. If I had cried before, I should have had Joe
with me then.

<p/>So subdued I was by those tears, and by their breaking out again in the
course of the quiet walk, that when I was on the coach, and it was clear
of the town, I deliberated with an aching heart whether I would not get
down when we changed horses and walk back, and have another evening at
home, and a better parting. We changed, and I had not made up my mind,
and still reflected for my comfort that it would be quite practicable to
get down and walk back, when we changed again. And while I was occupied
with these deliberations, I would fancy an exact resemblance to Joe
in some man coming along the road towards us, and my heart would beat
high.--As if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could possibly be there!

<p/>We changed again, and yet again, and it was now too late and too far to
go back, and I went on. And the mists had all solemnly risen now, and
the world lay spread before me.

<p/>This is the end of the first stage of Pip's expectations.

<p/>Chapter XX

<p/>The journey from our town to the metropolis was a journey of about five
hours. It was a little past midday when the four-horse stage-coach by
which I was a passenger, got into the ravel of traffic frayed out about
the Cross Keys, Wood Street, Cheapside, London.

<p/>We Britons had at that time particularly settled that it was treasonable
to doubt our having and our being the best of everything: otherwise,
while I was scared by the immensity of London, I think I might have had
some faint doubts whether it was not rather ugly, crooked, narrow, and
dirty.

<p/>Mr. Jaggers had duly sent me his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) address; it was, Little Britain, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>)
had written after it on his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) card, <div class="bookquote">``just out of Smithfield, and close by
the coach-office.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Nevertheless, a hackney-coachman, who seemed to have
as many capes to his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) greasy great-coat as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) was years old, packed me
up in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) coach and hemmed me in with a folding and jingling barrier of
steps, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) were going to take me fifty miles. His (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) getting on his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>)
box, which I remember to have been decorated with an old weather-stained
pea-green hammercloth moth-eaten into rags, was quite a work of time.
It was a wonderful equipage, with six great coronets outside, and ragged
things behind for I don't know how many footmen to hold on by, and
a harrow below them, to prevent amateur footmen from yielding to the
temptation.

<p/>I had scarcely had time to enjoy the coach and to think how like a
straw-yard it was, and yet how like a rag-shop, and to wonder why
the horses' nose-bags were kept inside, when I observed the coachman
beginning to get down, as if we were going to stop presently. And stop
we presently did, in a gloomy street, at certain offices with an open
door, whereon was painted MR. JAGGERS.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How much?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked the coachman.

<p/>The coachman answered, <div class="bookquote">``A shilling--unless you wish to make it more.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The coachman</b></font>)</div><p/>I naturally said I had no wish to make it more.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then it must be a shilling,''  (<font color='red'><b>the coachman</b></font>)</div>observed the coachman. <div class="bookquote">``I don't want to
get into trouble. I know him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>JAGGERS</b></font>) darkly closed an eye at Mr. Jaggers's
name, and shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) head.

<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) had got his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) shilling, and had in course of time completed the
ascent to his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) box, and had got away -LRB-which appeared to relieve his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>)
mind-RRB-, I went into the front office with my little portmanteau in my
hand and asked, Was Mr. Jaggers at home?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) is not,''  (<font color='red'><b>the clerk</b></font>)</div>returned the clerk. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) is in Court at present. Am I
addressing Mr. Pip?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I signified that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) was addressing Mr. Pip.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Jaggers left word, would you wait in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) room. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) couldn't say how
long he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) might be, having a case on. But it stands to reason, his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) time
being valuable, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) won't be longer than he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) can help.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the clerk</b></font>)</div><p/>With those words, the clerk opened a door, and ushered me into an inner
chamber at the back. Here, we found a gentleman with one eye, in a
velveteen suit and knee-breeches, who wiped his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) nose with his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) sleeve on
being interrupted in the perusal of the newspaper.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Go and wait outside, Mike,''  (<font color='red'><b>the clerk</b></font>)</div>said the clerk.

<p/>I began to say that I hoped I was not interrupting, when the clerk
shoved this gentleman out with as little ceremony as I ever saw used,
and tossing his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) fur cap out after him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>), left me alone.

<p/>Mr. Jaggers's room was lighted by a skylight only, and was a most dismal
place; the skylight, eccentrically pitched like a broken head, and the
distorted adjoining houses looking as if they had twisted themselves to
peep down at me through it. There were not so many papers about, as I
should have expected to see; and there were some odd objects about, that
I should not have expected to see,--such as an old rusty pistol, a
sword in a scabbard, several strange-looking boxes and packages, and
two dreadful casts on a shelf, of faces peculiarly swollen, and twitchy
about the nose. Mr. Jaggers's own high-backed chair was of deadly black
horsehair, with rows of brass nails round it, like a coffin; and I
fancied I could see how he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) leaned back in it, and bit his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) forefinger at
the clients. The room was but small, and the clients seemed to have had
a habit of backing up against the wall; the wall, especially opposite to
Mr. Jaggers's chair, being greasy with shoulders. I recalled, too, that
the one-eyed gentleman had shuffled forth against the wall when I was
the innocent cause of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) being turned out.

<p/>I sat down in the cliental chair placed over against Mr. Jaggers's
chair, and became fascinated by the dismal atmosphere of the place. I
called to mind that the clerk had the same air of knowing something to
everybody else's disadvantage, as his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) master had. I wondered how many
other clerks there were upstairs, and whether they all claimed to have
the same detrimental mastery of their fellow-creatures. I wondered what
was the history of all the odd litter about the room, and how it came
there. I wondered whether the two swollen faces were of Mr. Jaggers's
family, and, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) were so unfortunate as to have had a pair of such
ill-looking relations, why he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) stuck them on that dusty perch for the
blacks and flies to settle on, instead of giving them a place at home.
Of course I had no experience of a London summer day, and my spirits may
have been oppressed by the hot exhausted air, and by the dust and grit
that lay thick on everything. But I sat wondering and waiting in Mr.
Jaggers's close room, until I really could not bear the two casts on the
shelf above Mr. Jaggers's chair, and got up and went out.

<p/>When I told the clerk that I would take a turn in the air while I
waited, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) advised me to go round the corner and I should come into
Smithfield. So I came into Smithfield; and the shameful place, being all
asmear with filth and fat and blood and foam, seemed to stick to me. So,
I rubbed it off with all possible speed by turning into a street where
I saw the great black dome of Saint Paul's bulging at me from behind a
grim stone building which a bystander said was Newgate Prison. Following
the wall of the jail, I found the roadway covered with straw to deaden
the noise of passing vehicles; and from this, and from the quantity of
people standing about smelling strongly of spirits and beer, I inferred
that the trials were on.

<p/>While I looked about me here, an exceedingly dirty and partially drunk
minister of justice asked me if I would like to step in and hear a
trial or so: informing me that he (<font color='blue'><b>minister</b></font>) could give me a front place for half a
crown, whence I should command a full view of the Lord Chief Justice in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Chief</b></font>) wig and robes,--mentioning that awful personage like waxwork, and
presently offering him (<font color='blue'><b>Chief</b></font>) at the reduced price of eighteen-pence. As I
declined the proposal on the plea of an appointment, he (<font color='blue'><b>Chief</b></font>) was so good as
to take me into a yard and show me where the gallows was kept, and also
where people were publicly whipped, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Chief</b></font>) showed me the Debtors'
Door, out of which culprits came to be hanged; heightening the interest
of that dreadful portal by giving me to understand that <div class="bookquote">``four on `em''
 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>would come out at that door the day after to-morrow at eight in the
morning, to be killed in a row. This was horrible, and gave me a
sickening idea of London; the more so as the Lord Chief Justice's
proprietor wore -LRB-from his (<font color='blue'><b>proprietor</b></font>) hat down to his (<font color='blue'><b>proprietor</b></font>) boots and up again to his (<font color='blue'><b>proprietor</b></font>)
pocket-handkerchief inclusive-RRB- mildewed clothes which had evidently
not belonged to him (<font color='blue'><b>proprietor</b></font>) originally, and which I took it into my head he (<font color='blue'><b>proprietor</b></font>) had
bought cheap of the executioner. Under these circumstances I thought
myself well rid of him (<font color='blue'><b>proprietor</b></font>) for a shilling.

<p/>I dropped into the office to ask if Mr. Jaggers had come in yet, and I
found he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) had not, and I strolled out again. This time, I made the tour
of Little Britain, and turned into Bartholomew Close; and now I became
aware that other people were waiting about for Mr. Jaggers, as well
as I. There were two men of secret appearance lounging in Bartholomew
Close, and thoughtfully fitting their feet into the cracks of the
pavement as they talked together, one of whom said to the other when
they first passed me, that <div class="bookquote">``Jaggers would do it if it was to be done.''
 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>There was a knot of three men and two women standing at a corner, and
one of the women was crying on her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) dirty shawl, and the other comforted
her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) by saying, as she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) pulled her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) own shawl over her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) shoulders, <div class="bookquote">``Jaggers
is for him (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>), `Melia, and what more could you have?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>There was a red-eyed
little Jew who came into the Close while I was loitering there, in
company with a second little Jew whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) sent upon an errand; and
while the messenger was gone, I remarked this Jew, who was of a highly
excitable temperament, performing a jig of anxiety under a lamp-post and
accompanying himself, in a kind of frenzy, with the words, <div class="bookquote">``O Jaggerth,
Jaggerth, Jaggerth! all otherth ith Cag-Maggerth, give me Jaggerth!''
 (<font color='red'><b>this Jew</b></font>)</div>These testimonies to the popularity of my guardian made a deep
impression on me, and I admired and wondered more than ever.

<p/>At length, as I was looking out at the iron gate of Bartholomew Close
into Little Britain, I saw Mr. Jaggers coming across the road towards
me. All the others who were waiting saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) at the same time, and there
was quite a rush at him (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>). Mr. Jaggers, putting a hand on my shoulder
and walking me on at his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) side without saying anything to me, addressed
himself to his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) followers.

<p/>First, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) took the two secret men.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, I have nothing to say to you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jaggers/Jaggers/MR. JAGGERS</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Jaggers, throwing his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>)
finger at them. <div class="bookquote">``I want to know no more than I know. As to the result,
it's a toss-up. I told you from the first it was a toss-up. Have you
paid Wemmick?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We made the money up this morning, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>the men</b></font>)</div>said one of the men,
submissively, while the other perused Mr. Jaggers's face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't ask you when you made it up, or where, or whether you made it
up at all. Has Wemmick got it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>the men</b></font>)</div>said both the men together.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well; then you may go. Now, I won't have it!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr Jaggers/Jaggers</b></font>)</div>said Mr Jaggers,
waving his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) hand at them to put them behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``If you say a word to
me, I'll throw up the case.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We thought, Mr. Jaggers--''  (<font color='red'><b>the men</b></font>)</div>one of the men began, pulling off his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) hat.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's what I told you not to do,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jaggers/Jaggers/MR. JAGGERS</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Jaggers. <div class="bookquote">``You thought! I
think for you; that's enough for you. If I want you, I know where to
find you; I don't want you to find me. Now I won't have it. I won't hear
a word.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The men</b></font>)</div><p/>The two men looked at one another as Mr. Jaggers waved them behind
again, and humbly fell back and were heard no more.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And now you!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jaggers/Jaggers/MR. JAGGERS</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Jaggers, suddenly stopping, and turning on
the two women with the shawls, from whom the three men had meekly
separated,--<div class="bookquote">``Oh! Amelia, is it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the men</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Mr. Jaggers.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And do you remember,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jaggers/Jaggers/MR. JAGGERS</b></font>)</div>retorted Mr. Jaggers, <div class="bookquote">``that but for me you
wouldn't be here and couldn't be here?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jaggers/Jaggers/MR. JAGGERS</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``O yes, sir!''  (<font color='red'><b>both women</b></font>)</div>exclaimed both women together. <div class="bookquote">``Lord bless you, sir, well
we knows that!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then why,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jaggers/Jaggers/MR. JAGGERS</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Jaggers, <div class="bookquote">``do you come here?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jaggers/Jaggers/MR. JAGGERS</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My Bill, sir!''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>the crying woman pleaded.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, I tell you what!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jaggers/Jaggers/MR. JAGGERS</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Jaggers. <div class="bookquote">``Once for all. If you don't
know that your Bill's in good hands, I know it. And if you come here
bothering about your Bill, I'll make an example of both your Bill and
you, and let him (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) slip through my fingers. Have you paid Wemmick?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``O yes, sir! Every farden.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well. Then you have done all you have got to do. Say another
word--one single word--and Wemmick shall give you your money back.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the women</b></font>)</div><p/>This terrible threat caused the two women to fall off immediately.
No one remained now but the excitable Jew, who had already raised the
skirts of Mr. Jaggers's coat to his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) lips several times.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know this man!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jaggers/Jaggers/MR. JAGGERS</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Jaggers, in the same devastating
strain: <div class="bookquote">``What does this fellow want?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jaggers/Jaggers/MR. JAGGERS</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ma thear Mithter Jaggerth. Hown brother to Habraham Latharuth?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who's he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jaggers/Jaggers/MR. JAGGERS</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Jaggers. <div class="bookquote">``Let go of my coat.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The suitor</b></font>)</div><p/>The suitor, kissing the hem of the garment again before relinquishing
it, replied, <div class="bookquote">``Habraham Latharuth, on thuthpithion of plate.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The suitor</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You're too late,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jaggers/Jaggers/MR. JAGGERS</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Jaggers. <div class="bookquote">``I am over the way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Holy father, Mithter Jaggerth!''  (<font color='red'><b>acquaintance</b></font>)</div>cried my excitable acquaintance,
turning white, <div class="bookquote">``don't thay you're again Habraham Latharuth!''

 (<font color='red'><b>acquaintance</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jaggers/Jaggers/MR. JAGGERS</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Jaggers, <div class="bookquote">``and there's an end of it. Get out of the
way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jaggers/Jaggers/MR. JAGGERS</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mithter Jaggerth! Half a moment! My hown cuthen’th gone to Mithter
Wemmick at thith prethent minute, to hoffer him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) hany termth. Mithter

no object!--Mithter Jaggerth--Mithter--!''

 (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div><p/>My guardian threw his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) supplicant off with supreme indifference, and
left him (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) dancing on the pavement as if it were red hot. Without further
interruption, we reached the front office, where we found the clerk and
the man in velveteen with the fur cap.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here's Mike,''  (<font color='red'><b>the clerk</b></font>)</div>said the clerk, getting down from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stool, and
approaching Mr. Jaggers confidentially.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jaggers/Jaggers/MR. JAGGERS</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Jaggers, turning to the man, who was pulling a lock of
hair in the middle of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) forehead, like the Bull in Cock Robin pulling
at the bell-rope; <div class="bookquote">``your man comes on this afternoon. Well?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Cock Robin</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, Mas'r Jaggers,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mike</b></font>)</div>returned Mike, in the voice of a sufferer from a
constitutional cold; <div class="bookquote">``arter a deal o' trouble, I've found one, sir, as
might do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>a sufferer</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What is he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) prepared to swear?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, Mas'r Jaggers,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mike</b></font>)</div>said Mike, wiping his (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) nose on his (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) fur cap this
time; <div class="bookquote">``in a general way, anythink.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mike</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Jaggers suddenly became most irate. <div class="bookquote">``Now, I warned you before,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said
he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>), throwing his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) forefinger at the terrified client, <div class="bookquote">``that if you ever
presumed to talk in that way here, I'd make an example of you. You
infernal scoundrel, how dare you tell ME that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the client</b></font>)</div><p/>The client looked scared, but bewildered too, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) were unconscious
what he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) had done.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Spooney!''  (<font color='red'><b>the clerk</b></font>)</div>said the clerk, in a low voice, giving him (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) a stir with his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>)
elbow. <div class="bookquote">``Soft Head! Need you say it face to face?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, I ask you, you blundering booby,''  (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div>said my guardian, very sternly,
<div class="bookquote">``once more and for the last time, what the man you have brought here is
prepared to swear?''

 (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div><p/>Mike looked hard at my guardian, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) were trying to learn a lesson
from his (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) face, and slowly replied, <div class="bookquote">``Ayther to character, or to having
been in his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) company and never left him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) all the night in question.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, be careful. In what station of life is this man?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mike</b></font>)</div><p/>Mike looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) cap, and looked at the floor, and looked at the
ceiling, and looked at the clerk, and even looked at me, before
beginning to reply in a nervous manner, <div class="bookquote">``We've dressed him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) up like--''
 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>when my guardian blustered out,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What? You WILL, will you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div><p/>-LRB-<div class="bookquote">``Spooney!''  (<font color='red'><b>the clerk</b></font>)</div>added the clerk again, with another stir.-RRB-

<p/>After some helpless casting about, Mike brightened and began again:--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is dressed like a `spectable pieman. A sort of a pastry-cook.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mike</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) here?''  (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div>asked my guardian.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I left him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Mike</b></font>)</div>said Mike, <div class="bookquote">``a setting on some doorsteps round the corner.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mike</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Take him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) past that window, and let me see him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The window indicated was the office window. We all three went to
it, behind the wire blind, and presently saw the client go by in an
accidental manner, with a murderous-looking tall individual, in a short
suit of white linen and a paper cap. This guileless confectioner was not
by any means sober, and had a black eye in the green stage of recovery,
which was painted over.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to take his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) witness away directly,''  (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div>said my guardian to the
clerk, in extreme disgust, <div class="bookquote">``and ask him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) means by bringing such a
fellow as that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the clerk</b></font>)</div><p/>My guardian then took me into his (<font color='blue'><b>individual</b></font>) own room, and while he (<font color='blue'><b>individual</b></font>) lunched,
standing, from a sandwich-box and a pocket-flask of sherry -LRB-he (<font color='blue'><b>individual</b></font>) seemed to
bully his (<font color='blue'><b>individual</b></font>) very sandwich as he (<font color='blue'><b>individual</b></font>) ate it-RRB-, informed me what arrangements he (<font color='blue'><b>individual</b></font>)
had made for me. I was to go to <div class="bookquote">``Barnard's Inn,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>to young Mr. Pocket's
rooms, where a bed had been sent in for my accommodation; I was to
remain with young Mr. Pocket until Monday; on Monday I was to go with
him (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) father's house on a visit, that I might try how I liked it.
Also, I was told what my allowance was to be,--it was a very liberal
one,--and had handed to me from one of my guardian's drawers, the cards
of certain tradesmen with whom I was to deal for all kinds of clothes,
and such other things as I could in reason want. <div class="bookquote">``You will find your
credit good, Mr. Pip,''  (<font color='red'><b>guardian flask</b></font>)</div>said my guardian, whose flask of sherry smelt
like a whole caskful, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) hastily refreshed himself, <div class="bookquote">``but I shall by
this means be able to check your bills, and to pull you up if I find you
outrunning the constable. Of course you'll go wrong somehow, but that's
no fault of mine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>After I had pondered a little over this encouraging sentiment, I asked
Mr. Jaggers if I could send for a coach? He (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) said it was not worth while,
I was so near my destination; Wemmick should walk round with me, if I
pleased.

<p/>I then found that Wemmick was the clerk in the next room. Another clerk
was rung down from upstairs to take his (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) place while he (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) was out, and I
accompanied him (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) into the street, after shaking hands with my guardian.
We found a new set of people lingering outside, but Wemmick made a way
among them by saying coolly yet decisively, <div class="bookquote">``I tell you it's no use; he (<font color='blue'><b>constable</b></font>)
won't have a word to say to one of you;''  (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mrs. Wemmick</b></font>)</div>and we soon got clear of them,
and went on side by side.




<p/>Chapter XXI

<p/>Casting my eyes on Mr. Wemmick as we went along, to see what he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) was
like in the light of day, I found him (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) to be a dry man, rather short in
stature, with a square wooden face, whose expression seemed to have been
imperfectly chipped out with a dull-edged chisel. There were some marks
in it that might have been dimples, if the material had been softer and
the instrument finer, but which, as it was, were only dints. The chisel
had made three or four of these attempts at embellishment over his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) nose,
but had given them up without an effort to smooth them off. I judged him (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>)
to be a bachelor from the frayed condition of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) linen, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) appeared
to have sustained a good many bereavements; for he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) wore at least four
mourning rings, besides a brooch representing a lady and a weeping
willow at a tomb with an urn on it. I noticed, too, that several rings
and seals hung at his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) watch-chain, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) were quite laden with
remembrances of departed friends. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) had glittering eyes,--small, keen,
and black,--and thin wide mottled lips. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) had had them, to the best of
my belief, from forty to fifty years.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So you were never in London before?''  (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Wemmick to me.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I was new here once,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Wemmick. <div class="bookquote">``Rum to think of now!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are well acquainted with it now?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Wemmick. <div class="bookquote">``I know the moves of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it a very wicked place?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked, more for the sake of saying
something than for information.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You may get cheated, robbed, and murdered in London. But there are
plenty of people anywhere, who'll do that for you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If there is bad blood between you and them,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, to soften it off a
little.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``O! I don't know about bad blood,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div>returned Mr. Wemmick; <div class="bookquote">``there's not
much bad blood about. They'll do it, if there's anything to be got by
it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That makes it worse.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You think so?''  (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div>returned Mr. Wemmick. <div class="bookquote">``Much about the same, I should
say.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) wore his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) hat on the back of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) head, and looked straight before him (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>):
walking in a self-contained way as if there were nothing in the streets
to claim his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) attention. His (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) mouth was such a post-office of a mouth
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) had a mechanical appearance of smiling. We had got to the top of
Holborn Hill before I knew that it was merely a mechanical appearance,
and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) was not smiling at all.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you know where Mr. Matthew Pocket lives?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked Mr. Wemmick.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>), nodding in the direction. <div class="bookquote">``At Hammersmith, west of
London.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is that far?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well! Say five miles.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you know him (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, you're a regular cross-examiner!''  (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Wemmick, looking at me
with an approving air. <div class="bookquote">``Yes, I know him (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>). I know him (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>There was an air of toleration or depreciation about his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) utterance of
these words that rather depressed me; and I was still looking sideways
at his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) block of a face in search of any encouraging note to the text,
when he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) said here we were at Barnard's Inn. My depression was not
alleviated by the announcement, for, I had supposed that establishment
to be an hotel kept by Mr. Barnard, to which the Blue Boar in our town
was a mere public-house. Whereas I now found Barnard to be a disembodied
spirit, or a fiction, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Barnard</b></font>) inn the dingiest collection of shabby
buildings ever squeezed together in a rank corner as a club for
Tom-cats.

<p/>We entered this haven through a wicket-gate, and were disgorged by an
introductory passage into a melancholy little square that looked to me
like a flat burying-ground. I thought it had the most dismal trees in
it, and the most dismal sparrows, and the most dismal cats, and the most
dismal houses -LRB-in number half a dozen or so-RRB-, that I had ever seen. I
thought the windows of the sets of chambers into which those houses were
divided were in every stage of dilapidated blind and curtain, crippled
flower-pot, cracked glass, dusty decay, and miserable makeshift; while
To Let, To Let, To Let, glared at me from empty rooms, as if no new
wretches ever came there, and the vengeance of the soul of Barnard were
being slowly appeased by the gradual suicide of the present occupants
and their unholy interment under the gravel. A frowzy mourning of soot
and smoke attired this forlorn creation of Barnard, and it had strewn
ashes on its head, and was undergoing penance and humiliation as a mere
dust-hole. Thus far my sense of sight; while dry rot and wet rot and all
the silent rots that rot in neglected roof and cellar,--rot of rat
and mouse and bug and coaching-stables near at hand besides--addressed
themselves faintly to my sense of smell, and moaned, <div class="bookquote">``Try Barnard's
Mixture.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>So imperfect was this realization of the first of my great expectations,
that I looked in dismay at Mr. Wemmick. <div class="bookquote">``Ah!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>), mistaking me;
<div class="bookquote">``the retirement reminds you of the country. So it does me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) led me into a corner and conducted me up a flight of stairs,--which
appeared to me to be slowly collapsing into sawdust, so that one of
those days the upper lodgers would look out at their doors and find
themselves without the means of coming down,--to a set of chambers on
the top floor. MR. POCKET, JUN., was painted on the door, and there was
a label on the letter-box, <div class="bookquote">``Return shortly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Pocket/Matthew/Mr. Matthew Pocket</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Barnard</b></font>) hardly thought you'd come so soon,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div>Mr. Wemmick explained. <div class="bookquote">``You
don't want me any more?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, thank you,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``As I keep the cash,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>Mr. Wemmick observed, <div class="bookquote">``we shall most likely meet
pretty often. Good day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I put out my hand, and Mr. Wemmick at first looked at it as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>)
thought I wanted something. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) looked at me, and said, correcting
himself,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``To be sure! Yes. You're in the habit of shaking hands?''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>I was rather confused, thinking it must be out of the London fashion,
but said yes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have got so out of it!''  (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Wemmick,--<div class="bookquote">``except at last. Very
glad, I'm sure, to make your acquaintance. Good day!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div><p/>When we had shaken hands and he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) was gone, I opened the staircase window
and had nearly beheaded myself, for, the lines had rotted away, and it
came down like the guillotine. Happily it was so quick that I had not
put my head out. After this escape, I was content to take a foggy view
of the Inn through the window's encrusting dirt, and to stand dolefully
looking out, saying to myself that London was decidedly overrated.

<p/>Mr. Pocket, Junior's, idea of Shortly was not mine, for I had nearly
maddened myself with looking out for half an hour, and had written
my name with my finger several times in the dirt of every pane in the
window, before I heard footsteps on the stairs. Gradually there arose
before me the hat, head, neckcloth, waistcoat, trousers, boots, of a
member of society of about my own standing. He (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) had a paper-bag under
each arm and a pottle of strawberries in one hand, and was out of
breath.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Pip?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Pocket?''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear me!''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) exclaimed. <div class="bookquote">``I am extremely sorry; but I knew there was a
coach from your part of the country at midday, and I thought you would
come by that one. The fact is, I have been out on your account,--not
that that is any excuse,--for I thought, coming from the country, you
might like a little fruit after dinner, and I went to Covent Garden
Market to get it good.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>For a reason that I had, I felt as if my eyes would start out of my
head. I acknowledged his (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) attention incoherently, and began to think this
was a dream.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear me!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Pocket/Matthew/Mr. Matthew Pocket</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Pocket, Junior. <div class="bookquote">``This door sticks so!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) was fast making jam of his (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) fruit by wrestling with the door while
the paper-bags were under his (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) arms, I begged him (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) to allow me to hold
them. He (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) relinquished them with an agreeable smile, and combated with
the door as if it were a wild beast. It yielded so suddenly at last,
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) staggered back upon me, and I staggered back upon the opposite
door, and we both laughed. But still I felt as if my eyes must start out
of my head, and as if this must be a dream.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Pray come in,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Pocket/Matthew/Mr. Matthew Pocket</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Pocket, Junior. <div class="bookquote">``Allow me to lead the way. I am
rather bare here, but I hope you'll be able to make out tolerably well
till Monday. My father thought you would get on more agreeably through
to-morrow with me than with him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), and might like to take a walk about
London. I am sure I shall be very happy to show London to you. As to our
table, you won't find that bad, I hope, for it will be supplied from our
coffee-house here, and -LRB-it is only right I should add-RRB- at your expense,
such being Mr. Jaggers's directions. As to our lodging, it's not by
any means splendid, because I have my own bread to earn, and my father
hasn't anything to give me, and I shouldn't be willing to take it, if he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
had. This is our sitting-room,--just such chairs and tables and carpet
and so forth, you see, as they could spare from home. You mustn't give
me credit for the tablecloth and spoons and castors, because they come
for you from the coffee-house. This is my little bedroom; rather musty,
but Barnard's is musty. This is your bedroom; the furniture's hired for
the occasion, but I trust it will answer the purpose; if you should want
anything, I'll go and fetch it. The chambers are retired, and we shall
be alone together, but we shan't fight, I dare say. But dear me, I beg
your pardon, you're holding the fruit all this time. Pray let me take
these bags from you. I am quite ashamed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>As I stood opposite to Mr. Pocket, Junior, delivering him (<font color='blue'><b>Junior</b></font>) the bags, One,
Two, I saw the starting appearance come into his (<font color='blue'><b>Junior</b></font>) own eyes that I knew to
be in mine, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Junior</b></font>) said, falling back,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Lord bless me, you're the prowling boy!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, <div class="bookquote">``are the pale young gentleman!''




 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Chapter XXII

<p/>The pale young gentleman and I stood contemplating one another in
Barnard's Inn, until we both burst out laughing. <div class="bookquote">``The idea of its
being you!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Barnard</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``The idea of its being you!''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I. And then we
contemplated one another afresh, and laughed again. <div class="bookquote">``Well!''  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman all</b></font>)</div>said the
pale young gentleman, reaching out his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) hand good-humoredly, <div class="bookquote">``it's all
over now, I hope, and it will be magnanimous in you if you'll forgive me
for having knocked you about so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman all</b></font>)</div><p/>I derived from this speech that Mr. Herbert Pocket -LRB-for Herbert was the
pale young gentleman's name-RRB- still rather confounded his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) intention with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) execution. But I made a modest reply, and we shook hands warmly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You hadn't come into your good fortune at that time?''  (<font color='red'><b>Herbert/Herbert Pocket</b></font>)</div>said Herbert
Pocket.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) acquiesced: <div class="bookquote">``I heard it had happened very lately. I was rather
on the lookout for good fortune then.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. Miss Havisham had sent for me, to see if she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) could take a fancy to
me. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) couldn't,--at all events, she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) didn't.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I thought it polite to remark that I was surprised to hear that.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Bad taste,''  (<font color='red'><b>Herbert/Herbert Pocket</b></font>)</div>said Herbert, laughing, <div class="bookquote">``but a fact. Yes, she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) had sent for
me on a trial visit, and if I had come out of it successfully, I
suppose I should have been provided for; perhaps I should have been
what-you-may-called it to Estella.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Herbert/Herbert Pocket</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What's that?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked, with sudden gravity.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) was arranging his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) fruit in plates while we talked, which divided his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>)
attention, and was the cause of his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) having made this lapse of a word.
<div class="bookquote">``Affianced,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) explained, still busy with the fruit. <div class="bookquote">``Betrothed.
Engaged. What's-his-named. Any word of that sort.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How did you bear your disappointment?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Pooh!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``I didn't care much for it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>)'s a Tartar.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Havisham?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't say no to that, but I meant Estella. That girl's hard and
haughty and capricious to the last degree, and has been brought up by
Miss Havisham to wreak revenge on all the male sex.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What relation is she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) to Miss Havisham?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``None,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Only adopted.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why should she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) wreak revenge on all the male sex? What revenge?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Lord, Mr. Pip!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Don't you know?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear me! It's quite a story, and shall be saved till dinner-time. And
now let me take the liberty of asking you a question. How did you come
there, that day?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div><p/>I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) was attentive until I had finished, and then burst
out laughing again, and asked me if I was sore afterwards? I didn't
ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) was, for my conviction on that point was perfectly
established.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Jaggers is your guardian, I understand?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) went on.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You know he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) is Miss Havisham's man of business and solicitor, and has
her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) confidence when nobody else has?''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>This was bringing me -LRB-I felt-RRB- towards dangerous ground. I answered with
a constraint I made no attempt to disguise, that I had seen Mr. Jaggers
in Miss Havisham's house on the very day of our combat, but never at any
other time, and that I believed he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) had no recollection of having ever
seen me there.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) was so obliging as to suggest my father for your tutor, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>)
called on my father to propose it. Of course he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) knew about my father
from his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) connection with Miss Havisham. My father is Miss Havisham's
cousin; not that that implies familiar intercourse between them, for he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
is a bad courtier and will not propitiate her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Herbert/Herbert Pocket</b></font>)</div><p/>Herbert Pocket had a frank and easy way with him (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) that was very taking.
I had never seen any one then, and I have never seen any one since,
who more strongly expressed to me, in every look and tone, a natural
incapacity to do anything secret and mean. There was something
wonderfully hopeful about his (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) general air, and something that at the
same time whispered to me he (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) would never be very successful or rich. I
don't know how this was. I became imbued with the notion on that first
occasion before we sat down to dinner, but I cannot define by what
means.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) was still a pale young gentleman, and had a certain conquered languor
about him (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) in the midst of his (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) spirits and briskness, that did not seem
indicative of natural strength. He (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) had not a handsome face, but it was
better than handsome: being extremely amiable and cheerful. His (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) figure
was a little ungainly, as in the days when my knuckles had taken such
liberties with it, but it looked as if it would always be light and
young. Whether Mr. Trabb's local work would have sat more gracefully on
him (<font color='blue'><b>Trabb</b></font>) than on me, may be a question; but I am conscious that he (<font color='blue'><b>Trabb</b></font>) carried
off his (<font color='blue'><b>Trabb</b></font>) rather old clothes much better than I carried off my new suit.

<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Trabb</b></font>) was so communicative, I felt that reserve on my part would be a
bad return unsuited to our years. I therefore told him (<font color='blue'><b>Trabb</b></font>) my small story,
and laid stress on my being forbidden to inquire who my benefactor was.
I further mentioned that as I had been brought up a blacksmith in a
country place, and knew very little of the ways of politeness, I would
take it as a great kindness in him (<font color='blue'><b>blacksmith</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>blacksmith</b></font>) would give me a hint whenever
he (<font color='blue'><b>blacksmith</b></font>) saw me at a loss or going wrong.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``With pleasure,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>blacksmith</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``though I venture to prophesy that you'll want
very few hints. I dare say we shall be often together, and I should like
to banish any needless restraint between us. Will you do me the favour
to begin at once to call me by my Christian name, Herbert?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>I thanked him (<font color='blue'><b>blacksmith</b></font>) and said I would. I informed him (<font color='blue'><b>blacksmith</b></font>) in exchange that my
Christian name was Philip.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't take to Philip,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>), smiling, <div class="bookquote">``for it sounds like a moral
boy out of the spelling-book, who was so lazy that he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) fell into a pond,
or so fat that he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) couldn't see out of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) eyes, or so avaricious that
he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) locked up his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) cake till the mice ate it, or so determined to go a
bird's-nesting that he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) got himself eaten by bears who lived handy in the
neighborhood. I tell you what I should like. We are so harmonious, and
you have been a blacksmith,--would you mind it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shouldn't mind anything that you propose,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I answered, <div class="bookquote">``but I don't
understand you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Would you mind Handel for a familiar name? There's a charming piece of
music by Handel, called the Harmonious Blacksmith.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should like it very much.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then, my dear Handel,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>), turning round as the door opened,
<div class="bookquote">``here is the dinner, and I must beg of you to take the top of the table,
because the dinner is of your providing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>This I would not hear of, so he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) took the top, and I faced him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>). It was a
nice little dinner,--seemed to me then a very Lord Mayor's Feast,--and
it acquired additional relish from being eaten under those independent
circumstances, with no old people by, and with London all around us.
This again was heightened by a certain gypsy character that set the
banquet off; for while the table was, as Mr. Pumblechook might have
said, the lap of luxury,--being entirely furnished forth from the
coffee-house,--the circumjacent region of sitting-room was of a
comparatively pastureless and shifty character; imposing on the waiter
the wandering habits of putting the covers on the floor -LRB-where he (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>)
fell over them-RRB-, the melted butter in the arm-chair, the bread on the
bookshelves, the cheese in the coal-scuttle, and the boiled fowl into my
bed in the next room,--where I found much of its parsley and butter in
a state of congelation when I retired for the night. All this made the
feast delightful, and when the waiter was not there to watch me, my
pleasure was without alloy.

<p/>We had made some progress in the dinner, when I reminded Herbert of his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>)
promise to tell me about Miss Havisham.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``True,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) replied. <div class="bookquote">``I'll redeem it at once. Let me introduce the topic,
Handel, by mentioning that in London it is not the custom to put the
knife in the mouth,--for fear of accidents,--and that while the fork is
reserved for that use, it is not put further in than necessary. It is
scarcely worth mentioning, only it's as well to do as other people do.
Also, the spoon is not generally used over-hand, but under. This has
two advantages. You get at your mouth better -LRB-which after all is the
object-RRB-, and you save a good deal of the attitude of opening oysters, on
the part of the right elbow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) offered these friendly suggestions in such a lively way, that we both
laughed and I scarcely blushed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) pursued, <div class="bookquote">``concerning Miss Havisham. Miss Havisham, you must
know, was a spoilt child. Her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) mother died when she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) was a baby, and her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)
father denied her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) nothing. Her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) father was a country gentleman down in
your part of the world, and was a brewer. I don't know why it should
be a crack thing to be a brewer; but it is indisputable that while you
cannot possibly be genteel and bake, you may be as genteel as never was
and brew. You see it every day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yet a gentleman may not keep a public-house; may he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not on any account,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>returned Herbert; <div class="bookquote">``but a public-house may keep a
gentleman. Well! Mr. Havisham was very rich and very proud. So was his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>)
daughter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Herbert/Herbert Pocket</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Havisham was an only child?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I hazarded.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Stop a moment, I am coming to that. No, she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) was not an only child;
she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) had a half-brother. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) father privately married again--his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) cook, I
rather think.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was proud,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My good Handel, so he (<font color='blue'><b>Handel</b></font>) was. He (<font color='blue'><b>Handel</b></font>) married his (<font color='blue'><b>Handel</b></font>) second wife privately,
because he (<font color='blue'><b>Handel</b></font>) was proud, and in course of time she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) died. When she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was dead,
I apprehend he (<font color='blue'><b>Handel</b></font>) first told his (<font color='blue'><b>Handel</b></font>) daughter what he (<font color='blue'><b>Handel</b></font>) had done, and then
the son became a part of the family, residing in the house you are
acquainted with. As the son grew a young man, he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) turned out riotous,
extravagant, undutiful,--altogether bad. At last his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) father disinherited
him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>); but he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) softened when he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) was dying, and left him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) well off, though
not nearly so well off as Miss Havisham.--Take another glass of wine,
and excuse my mentioning that society as a body does not expect one
to be so strictly conscientious in emptying one's glass, as to turn it
bottom upwards with the rim on one's nose.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div><p/>I had been doing this, in an excess of attention to his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) recital. I
thanked him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>), and apologized. He (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Not at all,''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>and resumed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Havisham was now an heiress, and you may suppose was looked after
as a great match. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) half-brother had now ample means again, but what
with debts and what with new madness wasted them most fearfully again.
There were stronger differences between him (<font color='blue'><b>half-brother</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) than there had been
between him (<font color='blue'><b>half-brother</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>half-brother</b></font>) father, and it is suspected that he (<font color='blue'><b>half-brother</b></font>) cherished a deep
and mortal grudge against her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) as having influenced the father's anger.
Now, I come to the cruel part of the story,--merely breaking off, my
dear Handel, to remark that a dinner-napkin will not go into a tumbler.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Why I was trying to pack mine into my tumbler, I am wholly unable to
say. I only know that I found myself, with a perseverance worthy of a
much better cause, making the most strenuous exertions to compress it
within those limits. Again I thanked him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) and apologized, and again he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>)
said in the cheerfullest manner, <div class="bookquote">``Not at all, I am sure!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and resumed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There appeared upon the scene--say at the races, or the public
balls, or anywhere else you like--a certain man, who made love to Miss
Havisham. I never saw him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) -LRB-for this happened five-and-twenty years ago,
before you and I were, Handel-RRB-, but I have heard my father mention that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Handel</b></font>) was a showy man, and the kind of man for the purpose. But that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was
not to be, without ignorance or prejudice, mistaken for a gentleman, my
father most strongly asseverates; because it is a principle of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) that
no man who was not a true gentleman at heart ever was, since the world
began, a true gentleman in manner. He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) says, no varnish can hide the
grain of the wood; and that the more varnish you put on, the more the
grain will express itself. Well! This man pursued Miss Havisham closely,
and professed to be devoted to her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>). I believe she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) had not shown much
susceptibility up to that time; but all the susceptibility she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) possessed
certainly came out then, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) passionately loved him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). There is no
doubt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) perfectly idolized him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) practised on her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) affection in
that systematic way, that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) got great sums of money from her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
induced her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) to buy her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) brother out of a share in the brewery -LRB-which had
been weakly left him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) by his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) father-RRB- at an immense price, on the plea
that when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) husband he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) must hold and manage it all. Your
guardian was not at that time in Miss Havisham's counsels, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) was
too haughty and too much in love to be advised by any one. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) relations
were poor and scheming, with the exception of my father; he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was poor
enough, but not time-serving or jealous. The only independent one among
them, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) warned her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) was doing too much for this man, and
was placing herself too unreservedly in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) power. She (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) took the first
opportunity of angrily ordering my father out of the house, in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
presence, and my father has never seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) since.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I thought of her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) having said, <div class="bookquote">``Matthew will come and see me at last when
I am laid dead upon that table;''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>and I asked Herbert whether his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) father
was so inveterate against her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's not that,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``but she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) charged him (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>), in the presence of her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>)
intended husband, with being disappointed in the hope of fawning upon
her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) for his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) own advancement, and, if he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) were to go to her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) now, it would
look true--even to him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)--and even to her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>). To return to the man and make
an end of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). The marriage day was fixed, the wedding dresses were
bought, the wedding tour was planned out, the wedding guests were
invited. The day came, but not the bridegroom. He (<font color='blue'><b>bridegroom</b></font>) wrote her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) a letter--''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Which she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) received,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I struck in, <div class="bookquote">``when she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) was dressing for her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>)
marriage? At twenty minutes to nine?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``At the hour and minute,''  (<font color='red'><b>Herbert/Herbert Pocket</b></font>)</div>said Herbert, nodding, <div class="bookquote">``at which she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>)
afterwards stopped all the clocks. What was in it, further than that
it most heartlessly broke the marriage off, I can't tell you, because I
don't know. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) recovered from a bad illness that she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) had, she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>)
laid the whole place waste, as you have seen it, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) has never since
looked upon the light of day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Herbert/Herbert Pocket</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is that all the story?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked, after considering it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``All I know of it; and indeed I only know so much, through piecing it
out for myself; for my father always avoids it, and, even when Miss
Havisham invited me to go there, told me no more of it than it was
absolutely requisite I should understand. But I have forgotten one
thing. It has been supposed that the man to whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) misplaced
confidence acted throughout in concert with her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) half-brother; that it
was a conspiracy between them; and that they shared the profits.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wonder he (<font color='blue'><b>half-brother</b></font>) didn't marry her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) and get all the property,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>half-brother</b></font>) may have been married already, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) cruel mortification may have
been a part of her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) half-brother's scheme,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said Herbert. <div class="bookquote">``Mind! I don't
know that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What became of the two men?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked, after again considering the
subject.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They fell into deeper shame and degradation--if there can be
deeper--and ruin.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Are they alive now?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You said just now that Estella was not related to Miss Havisham, but
adopted. When adopted?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Herbert/Herbert Pocket</b></font>)</div><p/>Herbert shrugged his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) shoulders. <div class="bookquote">``There has always been an Estella, since
I have heard of a Miss Havisham. I know no more. And now, Handel,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said
he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>), finally throwing off the story as it were, <div class="bookquote">``there is a perfectly
open understanding between us. All that I know about Miss Havisham, you
know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And all that I know,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I retorted, <div class="bookquote">``you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I fully believe it. So there can be no competition or perplexity
between you and me. And as to the condition on which you hold your
advancement in life,--namely, that you are not to inquire or discuss to
whom you owe it,--you may be very sure that it will never be encroached
upon, or even approached, by me, or by any one belonging to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>In truth, he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) said this with so much delicacy, that I felt the subject
done with, even though I should be under his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) father's roof for years and
years to come. Yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) said it with so much meaning, too, that I felt
he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) as perfectly understood Miss Havisham to be my benefactress, as I
understood the fact myself.

<p/>It had not occurred to me before, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) had led up to the theme for
the purpose of clearing it out of our way; but we were so much the
lighter and easier for having broached it, that I now perceived this
to be the case. We were very gay and sociable, and I asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>), in the
course of conversation, what he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) was? He (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) replied, <div class="bookquote">``A capitalist,--an
Insurer of Ships.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>I suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) saw me glancing about the room in search
of some tokens of Shipping, or capital, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``In the City.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>I had grand ideas of the wealth and importance of Insurers of Ships in
the City, and I began to think with awe of having laid a young Insurer
on his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) back, blackened his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) enterprising eye, and cut his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) responsible
head open. But again there came upon me, for my relief, that odd
impression that Herbert Pocket would never be very successful or rich.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall not rest satisfied with merely employing my capital in insuring
ships. I shall buy up some good Life Assurance shares, and cut into the
Direction. I shall also do a little in the mining way. None of these
things will interfere with my chartering a few thousand tons on my own
account. I think I shall trade,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>), leaning back in his (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) chair, <div class="bookquote">``to
the East Indies, for silks, shawls, spices, dyes, drugs, and precious
woods. It's an interesting trade.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And the profits are large?''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tremendous!''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>).

<p/>I wavered again, and began to think here were greater expectations than
my own.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think I shall trade, also,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>), putting his (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) thumbs in his (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>)
waist-coat pockets, <div class="bookquote">``to the West Indies, for sugar, tobacco, and rum.
Also to Ceylon, specially for elephants' tusks.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You will want a good many ships,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A perfect fleet,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>).

<p/>Quite overpowered by the magnificence of these transactions, I asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>)
where the ships he (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) insured mostly traded to at present?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I haven't begun insuring yet,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) replied. <div class="bookquote">``I am looking about me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Barnard</b></font>)</div><p/>Somehow, that pursuit seemed more in keeping with Barnard's Inn. I said
-LRB-in a tone of conviction-RRB-, <div class="bookquote">``Ah-h!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. I am in a counting-house, and looking about me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is a counting-house profitable?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``To--do you mean to the young fellow who's in it?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Barnard</b></font>) asked, in reply.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, n-no; not to me.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Barnard</b></font>) said this with the air of one carefully
reckoning up and striking a balance. <div class="bookquote">``Not directly profitable. That is,
it doesn't pay me anything, and I have to--keep myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>This certainly had not a profitable appearance, and I shook my head as
if I would imply that it would be difficult to lay by much accumulative
capital from such a source of income.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But the thing is,''  (<font color='red'><b>Herbert/Herbert Pocket</b></font>)</div>said Herbert Pocket, <div class="bookquote">``that you look about you.
That's the grand thing. You are in a counting-house, you know, and you
look about you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Herbert/Herbert Pocket</b></font>)</div><p/>It struck me as a singular implication that you couldn't be out of a
counting-house, you know, and look about you; but I silently deferred to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) experience.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then the time comes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Herbert/Herbert Pocket</b></font>)</div>said Herbert, <div class="bookquote">``when you see your opening. And you
go in, and you swoop upon it and you make your capital, and then there
you are! When you have once made your capital, you have nothing to do
but employ it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Herbert/Herbert Pocket</b></font>)</div><p/>This was very like his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) way of conducting that encounter in the garden;
very like. His (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) manner of bearing his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) poverty, too, exactly corresponded
to his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) manner of bearing that defeat. It seemed to me that he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) took all
blows and buffets now with just the same air as he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) had taken mine
then. It was evident that he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) had nothing around him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) but the simplest
necessaries, for everything that I remarked upon turned out to have been
sent in on my account from the coffee-house or somewhere else.

<p/>Yet, having already made his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) fortune in his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) own mind, he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) was so
unassuming with it that I felt quite grateful to him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) for not being
puffed up. It was a pleasant addition to his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) naturally pleasant ways,
and we got on famously. In the evening we went out for a walk in the
streets, and went half-price to the Theatre; and next day we went to
church at Westminster Abbey, and in the afternoon we walked in the
Parks; and I wondered who shod all the horses there, and wished Joe did.

<p/>On a moderate computation, it was many months, that Sunday, since I had
left Joe and Biddy. The space interposed between myself and them partook
of that expansion, and our marshes were any distance off. That I could
have been at our old church in my old church-going clothes, on the very
last Sunday that ever was, seemed a combination of impossibilities,
geographical and social, solar and lunar. Yet in the London streets so
crowded with people and so brilliantly lighted in the dusk of evening,
there were depressing hints of reproaches for that I had put the poor
old kitchen at home so far away; and in the dead of night, the footsteps
of some incapable impostor of a porter mooning about Barnard's Inn,
under pretence of watching it, fell hollow on my heart.

<p/>On the Monday morning at a quarter before nine, Herbert went to
the counting-house to report himself,--to look about him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>), too, I
suppose,--and I bore him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) company. He (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) was to come away in an hour or
two to attend me to Hammersmith, and I was to wait about for him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>). It
appeared to me that the eggs from which young Insurers were hatched were
incubated in dust and heat, like the eggs of ostriches, judging from the
places to which those incipient giants repaired on a Monday morning. Nor
did the counting-house where Herbert assisted, show in my eyes as at
all a good Observatory; being a back second floor up a yard, of a grimy
presence in all particulars, and with a look into another back second
floor, rather than a look out.

<p/>I waited about until it was noon, and I went upon `Change, and I saw
fluey men sitting there under the bills about shipping, whom I took to
be great merchants, though I couldn't understand why they should all be
out of spirits. When Herbert came, we went and had lunch at a celebrated
house which I then quite venerated, but now believe to have been the
most abject superstition in Europe, and where I could not help noticing,
even then, that there was much more gravy on the tablecloths and knives
and waiters' clothes, than in the steaks. This collation disposed of at
a moderate price -LRB-considering the grease, which was not charged for-RRB-, we
went back to Barnard's Inn and got my little portmanteau, and then took
coach for Hammersmith. We arrived there at two or three o’clock in
the afternoon, and had very little way to walk to Mr. Pocket's house.
Lifting the latch of a gate, we passed direct into a little garden
overlooking the river, where Mr. Pocket's children were playing
about. And unless I deceive myself on a point where my interests or
prepossessions are certainly not concerned, I saw that Mr. and Mrs.
Pocket's children were not growing up or being brought up, but were
tumbling up.

<p/>Mrs. Pocket was sitting on a garden chair under a tree, reading, with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) legs upon another garden chair; and Mrs. Pocket's two nurse-maids
were looking about them while the children played. <div class="bookquote">``Mamma,''  (<font color='red'><b>Herbert/Herbert Pocket</b></font>)</div>said
Herbert, <div class="bookquote">``this is young Mr. Pip.''  (<font color='red'><b>Herbert/Herbert Pocket</b></font>)</div>Upon which Mrs. Pocket received me
with an appearance of amiable dignity.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Master Alick and Miss Jane,''  (<font color='red'><b>the nurses</b></font>)</div>cried one of the nurses to two of the
children, <div class="bookquote">``if you go a bouncing up against them bushes you'll fall over
into the river and be drownded, and what'll your pa say then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the children</b></font>)</div><p/>At the same time this nurse picked up Mrs. Pocket's handkerchief, and
said, <div class="bookquote">``If that don't make six times you've dropped it, Mum!''  (<font color='red'><b>this nurse</b></font>)</div>Upon which
Mrs. Pocket laughed and said, <div class="bookquote">``Thank you, Flopson,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>and settling herself
in one chair only, resumed her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) book. Her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) countenance immediately assumed
a knitted and intent expression as if she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) had been reading for a week,
but before she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) could have read half a dozen lines, she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) fixed her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) eyes
upon me, and said, <div class="bookquote">``I hope your mamma is quite well?''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>This unexpected
inquiry put me into such a difficulty that I began saying in the
absurdest way that if there had been any such person I had no doubt she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>)
would have been quite well and would have been very much obliged and
would have sent her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) compliments, when the nurse came to my rescue.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) cried, picking up the pocket-handkerchief, <div class="bookquote">``if that don't
make seven times! What ARE you a doing of this afternoon, Mum!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Mrs.
Pocket received her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) property, at first with a look of unutterable
surprise as if she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) had never seen it before, and then with a laugh of
recognition, and said, <div class="bookquote">``Thank you, Flopson,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and forgot me, and went on
reading.

<p/>I found, now I had leisure to count them, that there were no fewer than
six little Pockets present, in various stages of tumbling up. I had
scarcely arrived at the total when a seventh was heard, as in the region
of air, wailing dolefully.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If there ain't Baby!''  (<font color='red'><b>Flopson</b></font>)</div>said Flopson, appearing to think it most
surprising. <div class="bookquote">``Make haste up, Millers.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Millers nurse</b></font>)</div><p/>Millers, who was the other nurse, retired into the house, and by degrees
the child's wailing was hushed and stopped, as if it were a young
ventriloquist with something in its mouth. Mrs. Pocket read all the
time, and I was curious to know what the book could be.

<p/>We were waiting, I supposed, for Mr. Pocket to come out to us; at any
rate we waited there, and so I had an opportunity of observing the
remarkable family phenomenon that whenever any of the children strayed
near Mrs. Pocket in their play, they always tripped themselves up and
tumbled over her (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>),--always very much to her (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) momentary astonishment, and
their own more enduring lamentation. I was at a loss to account for
this surprising circumstance, and could not help giving my mind to
speculations about it, until by and by Millers came down with the baby,
which baby was handed to Flopson, which Flopson was handing it to Mrs.
Pocket, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) too went fairly head foremost over Mrs. Pocket, baby
and all, and was caught by Herbert and myself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Gracious me, Flopson!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Pocket, looking off her (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) book for a
moment, <div class="bookquote">``everybody's tumbling!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Gracious you, indeed, Mum!''  (<font color='red'><b>Flopson</b></font>)</div>returned Flopson, very red in the face;
<div class="bookquote">``what have you got there?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Flopson</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I got here, Flopson?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>asked Mrs. Pocket.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, if it ain't your footstool!''  (<font color='red'><b>Flopson</b></font>)</div>cried Flopson. <div class="bookquote">``And if you keep it
under your skirts like that, who's to help tumbling? Here! Take the
baby, Mum, and give me your book.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the infant</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Pocket acted on the advice, and inexpertly danced the infant a
little in her (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) lap, while the other children played about it. This had
lasted but a very short time, when Mrs. Pocket issued summary orders
that they were all to be taken into the house for a nap. Thus I made the
second discovery on that first occasion, that the nurture of the little
Pockets consisted of alternately tumbling up and lying down.

<p/>Under these circumstances, when Flopson and Millers had got the children
into the house, like a little flock of sheep, and Mr. Pocket came out
of it to make my acquaintance, I was not much surprised to find that Mr.
Pocket was a gentleman with a rather perplexed expression of face, and
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) very gray hair disordered on his (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) head, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) didn't quite
see his (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) way to putting anything straight.




<p/>Chapter XXIII

<p/>Mr. Pocket said he (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) was glad to see me, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) hoped I was not sorry to
see him (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``For, I really am not,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) added, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) son's smile,
<div class="bookquote">``an alarming personage.''  (<font color='red'><b>son</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) was a young-looking man, in spite of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) perplexities and his (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) very gray hair, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) manner seemed quite
natural. I use the word natural, in the sense of its being unaffected;
there was something comic in his (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) distraught way, as though it would have
been downright ludicrous but for his (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) own perception that it was very
near being so. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) had talked with me a little, he (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) said to Mrs.
Pocket, with a rather anxious contraction of his (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) eyebrows, which were
black and handsome, <div class="bookquote">``Belinda, I hope you have welcomed Mr. Pip?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>)
looked up from her (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) book, and said, <div class="bookquote">``Yes.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) then smiled upon me in an
absent state of mind, and asked me if I liked the taste of orange-flower
water? As the question had no bearing, near or remote, on any foregone
or subsequent transaction, I consider it to have been thrown out, like
her (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) previous approaches, in general conversational condescension.

<p/>I found out within a few hours, and may mention at once, that Mrs.
Pocket was the only daughter of a certain quite accidental deceased
Knight, who had invented for himself a conviction that his (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) deceased
father would have been made a Baronet but for somebody's determined
opposition arising out of entirely personal motives,--I forget whose,
if I ever knew,--the Sovereign's, the Prime Minister's, the Lord
Chancellor's, the Archbishop of Canterbury's, anybody's,--and had
tacked himself on to the nobles of the earth in right of this quite
supposititious fact. I believe he (<font color='blue'><b>Archbishop</b></font>) had been knighted himself for storming
the English grammar at the point of the pen, in a desperate address
engrossed on vellum, on the occasion of the laying of the first stone of
some building or other, and for handing some Royal Personage either the
trowel or the mortar. Be that as it may, he (<font color='blue'><b>Archbishop</b></font>) had directed Mrs. Pocket to
be brought up from her (<font color='blue'><b>Archbishop</b></font>) cradle as one who in the nature of things
must marry a title, and who was to be guarded from the acquisition of
plebeian domestic knowledge.

<p/>So successful a watch and ward had been established over the young lady
by this judicious parent, that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had grown up highly ornamental, but
perfectly helpless and useless. With her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) character thus happily formed,
in the first bloom of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) youth she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had encountered Mr. Pocket: who was
also in the first bloom of youth, and not quite decided whether to mount
to the Woolsack, or to roof himself in with a mitre. As his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) doing the
one or the other was a mere question of time, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) and Mrs. Pocket had
taken Time by the forelock -LRB-when, to judge from its length, it would
seem to have wanted cutting-RRB-, and had married without the knowledge of
the judicious parent. The judicious parent, having nothing to bestow or
withhold but his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) blessing, had handsomely settled that dower upon them
after a short struggle, and had informed Mr. Pocket that his (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) wife was <div class="bookquote">``a
treasure for a Prince.''  (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div>Mr. Pocket had invested the Prince's treasure
in the ways of the world ever since, and it was supposed to have brought
him (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) in but indifferent interest. Still, Mrs. Pocket was in general the
object of a queer sort of respectful pity, because she (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) had not married
a title; while Mr. Pocket was the object of a queer sort of forgiving
reproach, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) had never got one.

<p/>Mr. Pocket took me into the house and showed me my room: which was a
pleasant one, and so furnished as that I could use it with comfort for
my own private sitting-room. He (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) then knocked at the doors of two other
similar rooms, and introduced me to their occupants, by name Drummle
and Startop. Drummle, an old-looking young man of a heavy order of
architecture, was whistling. Startop, younger in years and appearance,
was reading and holding his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thought himself in danger of
exploding it with too strong a charge of knowledge.

<p/>Both Mr. and Mrs. Pocket had such a noticeable air of being in somebody
else's hands, that I wondered who really was in possession of the house
and let them live there, until I found this unknown power to be the
servants. It was a smooth way of going on, perhaps, in respect of saving
trouble; but it had the appearance of being expensive, for the servants
felt it a duty they owed to themselves to be nice in their eating and
drinking, and to keep a deal of company downstairs. They allowed a very
liberal table to Mr. and Mrs. Pocket, yet it always appeared to me that
by far the best part of the house to have boarded in would have been
the kitchen,--always supposing the boarder capable of self-defence, for,
before I had been there a week, a neighboring lady with whom the family
were personally unacquainted, wrote in to say that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had seen Millers
slapping the baby. This greatly distressed Mrs. Pocket, who burst into
tears on receiving the note, and said that it was an extraordinary thing
that the neighbors couldn't mind their own business.

<p/>By degrees I learnt, and chiefly from Herbert, that Mr. Pocket had been
educated at Harrow and at Cambridge, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) had distinguished himself;
but that when he (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) had had the happiness of marrying Mrs. Pocket very
early in life, he (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) had impaired his (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) prospects and taken up the calling
of a Grinder. After grinding a number of dull blades,--of whom it was
remarkable that their fathers, when influential, were always going to
help him (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) to preferment, but always forgot to do it when the blades had
left the Grindstone,--he (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) had wearied of that poor work and had come to
London. Here, after gradually failing in loftier hopes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) had <div class="bookquote">``read''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>with divers who had lacked opportunities or neglected them, and had
refurbished divers others for special occasions, and had turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>)
acquirements to the account of literary compilation and correction,
and on such means, added to some very moderate private resources, still
maintained the house I saw.

<p/>Mr. and Mrs. Pocket had a toady neighbor; a widow lady of that highly
sympathetic nature that she (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) agreed with everybody, blessed everybody,
and shed smiles and tears on everybody, according to circumstances. This
lady's name was Mrs. Coiler, and I had the honor of taking her (<font color='blue'><b>Coiler</b></font>) down to
dinner on the day of my installation. She (<font color='blue'><b>Coiler</b></font>) gave me to understand on the
stairs, that it was a blow to dear Mrs. Pocket that dear Mr. Pocket
should be under the necessity of receiving gentlemen to read with him (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>).
That did not extend to me, she (<font color='blue'><b>Coiler</b></font>) told me in a gush of love and confidence
-LRB-at that time, I had known her (<font color='blue'><b>Coiler</b></font>) something less than five minutes-RRB-; if
they were all like Me, it would be quite another thing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But dear Mrs. Pocket,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Coiler</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Coiler, <div class="bookquote">``after her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) early
disappointment -LRB-not that dear Mr. Pocket was to blame in that-RRB-, requires
so much luxury and elegance--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Coiler</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, ma’am,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Coiler</b></font>)</div>I said, to stop her (<font color='blue'><b>Coiler</b></font>), for I was afraid she (<font color='blue'><b>Coiler</b></font>) was going to
cry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) is of so aristocratic a disposition--''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, ma’am,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said again, with the same object as before.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``--That it is hard,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Coiler</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Coiler, <div class="bookquote">``to have dear Mr. Pocket's time
and attention diverted from dear Mrs. Pocket.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Coiler</b></font>)</div><p/>I could not help thinking that it might be harder if the butcher's time
and attention were diverted from dear Mrs. Pocket; but I said nothing,
and indeed had enough to do in keeping a bashful watch upon my company
manners.

<p/>It came to my knowledge, through what passed between Mrs. Pocket and
Drummle while I was attentive to my knife and fork, spoon, glasses, and
other instruments of self-destruction, that Drummle, whose Christian
name was Bentley, was actually the next heir but one to a baronetcy.
It further appeared that the book I had seen Mrs. Pocket reading in the
garden was all about titles, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Drummle</b></font>) knew the exact date at which
her (<font color='blue'><b>Drummle</b></font>) grandpapa would have come into the book, if he (<font color='blue'><b>heir</b></font>) ever had come at all.
Drummle didn't say much, but in his (<font color='blue'><b>heir</b></font>) limited way -LRB-he (<font color='blue'><b>heir</b></font>) struck me as a sulky
kind of fellow-RRB- he (<font color='blue'><b>heir</b></font>) spoke as one of the elect, and recognized Mrs. Pocket
as a woman and a sister. No one but themselves and Mrs. Coiler the toady
neighbor showed any interest in this part of the conversation, and it
appeared to me that it was painful to Herbert; but it promised to last
a long time, when the page came in with the announcement of a domestic
affliction. It was, in effect, that the cook had mislaid the beef. To my
unutterable amazement, I now, for the first time, saw Mr. Pocket
relieve his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) mind by going through a performance that struck me as very
extraordinary, but which made no impression on anybody else, and
with which I soon became as familiar as the rest. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) laid down the
carving-knife and fork,--being engaged in carving, at the moment,--put
his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) two hands into his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) disturbed hair, and appeared to make an
extraordinary effort to lift himself up by it. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) had done this,
and had not lifted himself up at all, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) quietly went on with what he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>)
was about.

<p/>Mrs. Coiler then changed the subject and began to flatter me. I liked
it for a few moments, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Coiler</b></font>) flattered me so very grossly that the
pleasure was soon over. She (<font color='blue'><b>Coiler</b></font>) had a serpentine way of coming close at
me when she (<font color='blue'><b>Coiler</b></font>) pretended to be vitally interested in the friends and
localities I had left, which was altogether snaky and fork-tongued; and
when she (<font color='blue'><b>Coiler</b></font>) made an occasional bounce upon Startop -LRB-who said very little to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Coiler</b></font>)-RRB-, or upon Drummle -LRB-who said less-RRB-, I rather envied them for being on
the opposite side of the table.

<p/>After dinner the children were introduced, and Mrs. Coiler made admiring
comments on their eyes, noses, and legs,--a sagacious way of improving
their minds. There were four little girls, and two little boys, besides
the baby who might have been either, and the baby's next successor who
was as yet neither. They were brought in by Flopson and Millers, much as
though those two non-commissioned officers had been recruiting somewhere
for children and had enlisted these, while Mrs. Pocket looked at the
young Nobles that ought to have been as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Coiler</b></font>) rather thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Coiler</b></font>) had
had the pleasure of inspecting them before, but didn't quite know what
to make of them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here! Give me your fork, Mum, and take the baby,''  (<font color='red'><b>Flopson</b></font>)</div>said Flopson. <div class="bookquote">``Don't
take it that way, or you'll get its head under the table.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Pocket</b></font>)</div><p/>Thus advised, Mrs. Pocket took it the other way, and got its head
upon the table; which was announced to all present by a prodigious
concussion.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear, dear! Give it me back, Mum,''  (<font color='red'><b>Flopson</b></font>)</div>said Flopson; <div class="bookquote">``and Miss Jane, come
and dance to baby, do!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Flopson</b></font>)</div><p/>One of the little girls, a mere mite who seemed to have prematurely
taken upon herself some charge of the others, stepped out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) place
by me, and danced to and from the baby until it left off crying, and
laughed. Then, all the children laughed, and Mr. Pocket -LRB-who in the
meantime had twice endeavored to lift himself up by the hair-RRB- laughed,
and we all laughed and were glad.

<p/>Flopson, by dint of doubling the baby at the joints like a Dutch doll,
then got it safely into Mrs. Pocket's lap, and gave it the nut-crackers
to play with; at the same time recommending Mrs. Pocket to take notice
that the handles of that instrument were not likely to agree with its
eyes, and sharply charging Miss Jane to look after the same. Then, the
two nurses left the room, and had a lively scuffle on the staircase with
a dissipated page who had waited at dinner, and who had clearly lost
half his (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) buttons at the gaming-table.

<p/>I was made very uneasy in my mind by Mrs. Pocket's falling into a
discussion with Drummle respecting two baronetcies, while she (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) ate a
sliced orange steeped in sugar and wine, and, forgetting all about the
baby on her (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) lap, who did most appalling things with the nut-crackers. At
length little Jane, perceiving its young brains to be imperilled, softly
left her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) place, and with many small artifices coaxed the dangerous
weapon away. Mrs. Pocket finishing her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) orange at about the same time,
and not approving of this, said to Jane,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You naughty child, how dare you? Go and sit down this instant!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jane/Miss Jane</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mamma dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl ood</b></font>)</div>lisped the little girl, <div class="bookquote">``baby ood have put hith eyeth
out.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the girl ood</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How dare you tell me so?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>retorted Mrs. Pocket. <div class="bookquote">``Go and sit down in
your chair this moment!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Pocket</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Pocket's dignity was so crushing, that I felt quite abashed, as if
I myself had done something to rouse it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Belinda,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Pocket/Matthew/Mr. Matthew Pocket</b></font>)</div>remonstrated Mr. Pocket, from the other end of the table,
<div class="bookquote">``how can you be so unreasonable? Jane only interfered for the protection
of baby.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Pocket/Matthew/Mr. Matthew Pocket</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will not allow anybody to interfere,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Pocket. <div class="bookquote">``I am
surprised, Matthew, that you should expose me to the affront of
interference.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good God!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Pocket/Matthew/Mr. Matthew Pocket</b></font>)</div>cried Mr. Pocket, in an outbreak of desolate desperation.
<div class="bookquote">``Are infants to be nut-crackered into their tombs, and is nobody to save
them?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will not be interfered with by Jane,''  (<font color='red'><b>that offender</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Pocket, with a
majestic glance at that innocent little offender. <div class="bookquote">``I hope I know my poor
grandpapa's position. Jane, indeed!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Pocket/Matthew/Mr. Matthew Pocket</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Pocket got his (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) hands in his (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) hair again, and this time really did
lift himself some inches out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) chair. <div class="bookquote">``Hear this!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) helplessly
exclaimed to the elements. <div class="bookquote">``Babies are to be nut-crackered dead, for
people's poor grandpapa's positions!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) let himself down again,
and became silent.

<p/>We all looked awkwardly at the tablecloth while this was going on. A
pause succeeded, during which the honest and irrepressible baby made a
series of leaps and crows at little Jane, who appeared to me to be the
only member of the family -LRB-irrespective of servants-RRB- with whom it had
any decided acquaintance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Drummle,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Pocket, <div class="bookquote">``will you ring for Flopson? Jane, you
undutiful little thing, go and lie down. Now, baby darling, come with
ma!''

 (<font color='red'><b>The baby</b></font>)</div><p/>The baby was the soul of honor, and protested with all its might. It
doubled itself up the wrong way over Mrs. Pocket's arm, exhibited a pair
of knitted shoes and dimpled ankles to the company in lieu of its soft
face, and was carried out in the highest state of mutiny. And it gained
its point after all, for I saw it through the window within a few
minutes, being nursed by little Jane.

<p/>It happened that the other five children were left behind at the
dinner-table, through Flopson's having some private engagement, and
their not being anybody else's business. I thus became aware of the
mutual relations between them and Mr. Pocket, which were exemplified in
the following manner. Mr. Pocket, with the normal perplexity of his (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) face
heightened and his (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) hair rumpled, looked at them for some minutes, as if
he (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) couldn't make out how they came to be boarding and lodging in that
establishment, and why they hadn't been billeted by Nature on
somebody else. Then, in a distant Missionary way he (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) asked them certain
questions,--as why little Joe had that hole in his (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) frill, who said, Pa,
Flopson was going to mend it when she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) had time,--and how little Fanny
came by that whitlow, who said, Pa, Millers was going to poultice it
when she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) didn't forget. Then, he (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) melted into parental tenderness, and
gave them a shilling apiece and told them to go and play; and then as
they went out, with one very strong effort to lift himself up by the
hair he (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) dismissed the hopeless subject.

<p/>In the evening there was rowing on the river. As Drummle and Startop had
each a boat, I resolved to set up mine, and to cut them both out. I was
pretty good at most exercises in which country boys are adepts, but as
I was conscious of wanting elegance of style for the Thames,--not to say
for other waters,--I at once engaged to place myself under the tuition
of the winner of a prize-wherry who plied at our stairs, and to whom I
was introduced by my new allies. This practical authority confused me
very much by saying I had the arm of a blacksmith. If he (<font color='blue'><b>blacksmith</b></font>) could have
known how nearly the compliment lost him (<font color='blue'><b>blacksmith</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>blacksmith</b></font>) pupil, I doubt if he (<font color='blue'><b>blacksmith</b></font>) would
have paid it.

<p/>There was a supper-tray after we got home at night, and I think we
should all have enjoyed ourselves, but for a rather disagreeable
domestic occurrence. Mr. Pocket was in good spirits, when a housemaid
came in, and said, <div class="bookquote">``If you please, sir, I should wish to speak to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>a housemaid</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Speak to your master?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Pocket, whose dignity was roused
again. <div class="bookquote">``How can you think of such a thing? Go and speak to Flopson. Or
speak to me--at some other time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Begging your pardon, ma’am,''  (<font color='red'><b>the housemaid</b></font>)</div>returned the housemaid, <div class="bookquote">``I should wish to
speak at once, and to speak to master.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the housemaid</b></font>)</div><p/>Hereupon, Mr. Pocket went out of the room, and we made the best of
ourselves until he (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) came back.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This is a pretty thing, Belinda!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Pocket/Matthew/Mr. Matthew Pocket</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Pocket, returning with a
countenance expressive of grief and despair. <div class="bookquote">``Here's the cook lying
insensibly drunk on the kitchen floor, with a large bundle of fresh
butter made up in the cupboard ready to sell for grease!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Pocket instantly showed much amiable emotion, and said, <div class="bookquote">``This is
that odious Sophia's doing!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you mean, Belinda?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Pocket/Matthew/Mr. Matthew Pocket</b></font>)</div>demanded Mr. Pocket.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sophia has told you,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Pocket. <div class="bookquote">``Did I not see her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) with my own
eyes and hear her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) with my own ears, come into the room just now and ask
to speak to you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But has she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) not taken me downstairs, Belinda,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Pocket/Matthew/Mr. Matthew Pocket</b></font>)</div>returned Mr. Pocket,
<div class="bookquote">``and shown me the woman, and the bundle too?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Pocket/Matthew/Mr. Matthew Pocket</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And do you defend her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>), Matthew,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Pocket</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Pocket, <div class="bookquote">``for making
mischief?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Pocket</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Pocket uttered a dismal groan.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Am I, grandpapa's granddaughter, to be nothing in the house?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Mrs.

and said in the most natural manner when she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) came to look after the

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Pocket/Matthew/Mr. Matthew Pocket</b></font>)</div><p/>There was a sofa where Mr. Pocket stood, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) dropped upon it in the
attitude of the Dying Gladiator. Still in that attitude he (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) said, with a
hollow voice, <div class="bookquote">``Good night, Mr. Pip,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>when I deemed it advisable to go to
bed and leave him (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>).




<p/>Chapter XXIV

<p/>After two or three days, when I had established myself in my room and
had gone backwards and forwards to London several times, and had ordered
all I wanted of my tradesmen, Mr. Pocket and I had a long talk together.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) knew more of my intended career than I knew myself, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) referred
to his (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) having been told by Mr. Jaggers that I was not designed for any
profession, and that I should be well enough educated for my destiny
if I could <div class="bookquote">``hold my own''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>with the average of young men in prosperous
circumstances. I acquiesced, of course, knowing nothing to the contrary.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) advised my attending certain places in London, for the acquisition of
such mere rudiments as I wanted, and my investing him (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) with the functions
of explainer and director of all my studies. He (<font color='blue'><b>director</b></font>) hoped that with
intelligent assistance I should meet with little to discourage me, and
should soon be able to dispense with any aid but his (<font color='blue'><b>director</b></font>). Through his (<font color='blue'><b>director</b></font>) way
of saying this, and much more to similar purpose, he (<font color='blue'><b>director</b></font>) placed himself on
confidential terms with me in an admirable manner; and I may state
at once that he (<font color='blue'><b>director</b></font>) was always so zealous and honorable in fulfilling his (<font color='blue'><b>director</b></font>)
compact with me, that he (<font color='blue'><b>director</b></font>) made me zealous and honorable in fulfilling
mine with him (<font color='blue'><b>director</b></font>). If he (<font color='blue'><b>director</b></font>) had shown indifference as a master, I have no doubt
I should have returned the compliment as a pupil; he (<font color='blue'><b>pupil</b></font>) gave me no such
excuse, and each of us did the other justice. Nor did I ever regard
him (<font color='blue'><b>pupil</b></font>) as having anything ludicrous about him (<font color='blue'><b>pupil</b></font>)--or anything but what was
serious, honest, and good--in his (<font color='blue'><b>pupil</b></font>) tutor communication with me.

<p/>When these points were settled, and so far carried out as that I had
begun to work in earnest, it occurred to me that if I could retain my
bedroom in Barnard's Inn, my life would be agreeably varied, while my
manners would be none the worse for Herbert's society. Mr. Pocket did
not object to this arrangement, but urged that before any step could
possibly be taken in it, it must be submitted to my guardian. I felt
that this delicacy arose out of the consideration that the plan would
save Herbert some expense, so I went off to Little Britain and imparted
my wish to Mr. Jaggers.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If I could buy the furniture now hired for me,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, <div class="bookquote">``and one or two
other little things, I should be quite at home there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Go it!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jaggers/Jaggers/MR. JAGGERS</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Jaggers, with a short laugh. <div class="bookquote">``I told you you'd get on.
Well! How much do you want?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I said I didn't know how much.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jaggers/Jaggers/MR. JAGGERS</b></font>)</div>retorted Mr. Jaggers. <div class="bookquote">``How much? Fifty pounds?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``O, not nearly so much.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Five pounds?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jaggers/Jaggers/MR. JAGGERS</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Jaggers.

<p/>This was such a great fall, that I said in discomfiture, <div class="bookquote">``O, more than
that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``More than that, eh!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jaggers/Jaggers/MR. JAGGERS</b></font>)</div>retorted Mr. Jaggers, lying in wait for me, with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) hands in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) pockets, his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) head on one side, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) eyes on the wall
behind me; <div class="bookquote">``how much more?''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is so difficult to fix a sum,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, hesitating.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jaggers/Jaggers/MR. JAGGERS</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Jaggers. <div class="bookquote">``Let's get at it. Twice five; will that do?
Three times five; will that do? Four times five; will that do?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I said I thought that would do handsomely.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Four times five will do handsomely, will it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jaggers/Jaggers/MR. JAGGERS</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Jaggers,
knitting his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) brows. <div class="bookquote">``Now, what do you make of four times five?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What do I make of it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jaggers/Jaggers/MR. JAGGERS</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Jaggers; <div class="bookquote">``how much?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jaggers/Jaggers/MR. JAGGERS</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose you make it twenty pounds,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, smiling.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Never mind what I make it, my friend,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jaggers/Jaggers/MR. JAGGERS</b></font>)</div>observed Mr. Jaggers, with a
knowing and contradictory toss of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``I want to know what you
make it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Twenty pounds, of course.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Wemmick!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jaggers/Jaggers/MR. JAGGERS</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Jaggers, opening his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) office door. <div class="bookquote">``Take Mr. Pip's
written order, and pay him (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) twenty pounds.''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>This strongly marked way of doing business made a strongly marked
impression on me, and that not of an agreeable kind. Mr. Jaggers never
laughed; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) wore great bright creaking boots, and, in poising
himself on these boots, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) large head bent down and his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) eyebrows
joined together, awaiting an answer, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) sometimes caused the boots to
creak, as if they laughed in a dry and suspicious way. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) happened
to go out now, and as Wemmick was brisk and talkative, I said to Wemmick
that I hardly knew what to make of Mr. Jaggers's manner.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) that, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>)'ll take it as a compliment,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div>answered Wemmick;
<div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) don't mean that you should know what to make of it.--Oh!''  (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div>for
I looked surprised, <div class="bookquote">``it's not personal; it's professional: only
professional.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Wemmick was at his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) desk, lunching--and crunching--on a dry hard biscuit;
pieces of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) threw from time to time into his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) slit of a mouth, as
if he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) were posting them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Always seems to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div>said Wemmick, <div class="bookquote">``as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) had set a man-trap and was
watching it. Suddenly-click--you're caught!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div><p/>Without remarking that man-traps were not among the amenities of life, I
said I supposed he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) was very skilful?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Deep,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div>said Wemmick, <div class="bookquote">``as Australia.''  (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div>Pointing with his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) pen at the
office floor, to express that Australia was understood, for the purposes
of the figure, to be symmetrically on the opposite spot of the globe.
<div class="bookquote">``If there was anything deeper,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div>added Wemmick, bringing his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) pen to
paper, <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>)'d be it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div><p/>Then, I said I supposed he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) had a fine business, and Wemmick said,
<div class="bookquote">``Ca-pi-tal!''  (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div>Then I asked if there were many clerks? to which he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>)
replied,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We don't run much into clerks, because there's only one Jaggers, and
people won't have him (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) at second hand. There are only four of us. Would
you like to see `em? You are one of us, as I may say.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>I accepted the offer. When Mr. Wemmick had put all the biscuit into the
post, and had paid me my money from a cash-box in a safe, the key
of which safe he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) kept somewhere down his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) back and produced from his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>)
coat-collar like an iron-pigtail, we went upstairs. The house was dark
and shabby, and the greasy shoulders that had left their mark in Mr.
Jaggers's room seemed to have been shuffling up and down the staircase
for years. In the front first floor, a clerk who looked something
between a publican and a rat-catcher--a large pale, puffed, swollen
man--was attentively engaged with three or four people of shabby
appearance, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) treated as unceremoniously as everybody seemed to
be treated who contributed to Mr. Jaggers's coffers. <div class="bookquote">``Getting evidence
together,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Wemmick, as we came out, <div class="bookquote">``for the Bailey.''  (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div>In the
room over that, a little flabby terrier of a clerk with dangling hair
-LRB-his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) cropping seemed to have been forgotten when he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) was a puppy-RRB- was
similarly engaged with a man with weak eyes, whom Mr. Wemmick presented
to me as a smelter who kept his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) pot always boiling, and who would melt
me anything I pleased,--and who was in an excessive white-perspiration,
as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) had been trying his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) art on himself. In a back room, a
high-shouldered man with a face-ache tied up in dirty flannel, who was
dressed in old black clothes that bore the appearance of having been
waxed, was stooping over his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) work of making fair copies of the notes of
the other two gentlemen, for Mr. Jaggers's own use.

<p/>This was all the establishment. When we went downstairs again, Wemmick
led me into my guardian's room, and said, <div class="bookquote">``This you've seen already.''

 (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pray,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, as the two odious casts with the twitchy leer upon them
caught my sight again, <div class="bookquote">``whose likenesses are those?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``These?''  (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div>said Wemmick, getting upon a chair, and blowing the dust off
the horrible heads before bringing them down. <div class="bookquote">``These are two celebrated
ones. Famous clients of ours that got us a world of credit. This chap
-LRB-why you must have come down in the night and been peeping into the
inkstand, to get this blot upon your eyebrow, you old rascal!-RRB- murdered
his (<font color='blue'><b>rascal</b></font>) master, and, considering that he (<font color='blue'><b>rascal</b></font>) wasn't brought up to evidence,
didn't plan it badly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it like him (<font color='blue'><b>rascal</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked, recoiling from the brute, as Wemmick spat
upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) eyebrow and gave it a rub with his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) sleeve.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Like him (<font color='blue'><b>rascal</b></font>)? It's himself, you know. The cast was made in Newgate,
directly after he (<font color='blue'><b>rascal</b></font>) was taken down. You had a particular fancy for
me, hadn't you, Old Artful?''  (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div>said Wemmick. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) then explained this
affectionate apostrophe, by touching his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) brooch representing the lady
and the weeping willow at the tomb with the urn upon it, and saying,
<div class="bookquote">``Had it made for me, express!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the lady willow</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is the lady anybody?''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>returned Wemmick. <div class="bookquote">``Only his (<font color='blue'><b>rascal</b></font>) game. -LRB-You liked your bit of game,
didn't you?-RRB- No; deuce a bit of a lady in the case, Mr. Pip, except
one,--and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) wasn't of this slender lady-like sort, and you wouldn't
have caught her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) looking after this urn, unless there was something to
drink in it.''  (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div>Wemmick's attention being thus directed to his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) brooch, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>)
put down the cast, and polished the brooch with his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) pocket-handkerchief.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Did that other creature come to the same end?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) has the
same look.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You're right,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div>said Wemmick; <div class="bookquote">``it's the genuine look. Much as if one
nostril was caught up with a horse-hair and a little fish-hook. Yes,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) came to the same end; quite the natural end here, I assure you.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) forged wills, this blade did, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) didn't also put the supposed
testators to sleep too. You were a gentlemanly Cove, though''  (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div>-LRB-Mr.
Wemmick was again apostrophizing-RRB-, <div class="bookquote">``and you said you could write Greek.
Yah, Bounceable! What a liar you were! I never met such a liar as you!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div>Before putting his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) late friend on his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) shelf again, Wemmick touched the
largest of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) mourning rings and said, <div class="bookquote">``Sent out to buy it for me, only
the day before.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div><p/>While he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) was putting up the other cast and coming down from the chair,
the thought crossed my mind that all his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) personal jewelry was derived
from like sources. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) had shown no diffidence on the subject, I
ventured on the liberty of asking him (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) the question, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) stood before
me, dusting his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) hands.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``O yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) returned, <div class="bookquote">``these are all gifts of that kind. One brings
another, you see; that's the way of it. I always take `em. They're
curiosities. And they're property. They may not be worth much, but,
after all, they're property and portable. It don't signify to you with
your brilliant lookout, but as to myself, my guiding-star always is,
`Get hold of portable property'.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>When I had rendered homage to this light, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) went on to say, in a
friendly manner:--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If at any odd time when you have nothing better to do, you wouldn't
mind coming over to see me at Walworth, I could offer you a bed, and I
should consider it an honor. I have not much to show you; but such two
or three curiosities as I have got you might like to look over; and I am
fond of a bit of garden and a summer-house.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>I said I should be delighted to accept his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) hospitality.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thankee,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``then we'll consider that it's to come off, when
convenient to you. Have you dined with Mr. Jaggers yet?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not yet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div>said Wemmick, <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>)'ll give you wine, and good wine. I'll give you
punch, and not bad punch. And now I'll tell you something. When you go
to dine with Mr. Jaggers, look at his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) housekeeper.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Shall I see something very uncommon?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div>said Wemmick, <div class="bookquote">``you'll see a wild beast tamed. Not so very
uncommon, you'll tell me. I reply, that depends on the original wildness
of the beast, and the amount of taming. It won't lower your opinion of
Mr. Jaggers's powers. Keep your eye on it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div><p/>I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) I would do so, with all the interest and curiosity that his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>)
preparation awakened. As I was taking my departure, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) asked me if I
would like to devote five minutes to seeing Mr. Jaggers <div class="bookquote">``at it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jaggers/Jaggers/MR. JAGGERS</b></font>)</div><p/>For several reasons, and not least because I didn't clearly know what
Mr. Jaggers would be found to be <div class="bookquote">``at,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jaggers/Jaggers/MR. JAGGERS</b></font>)</div>I replied in the affirmative.
We dived into the City, and came up in a crowded police-court, where
a blood-relation -LRB-in the murderous sense-RRB- of the deceased, with the
fanciful taste in brooches, was standing at the bar, uncomfortably
chewing something; while my guardian had a woman under examination or
cross-examination,--I don't know which,--and was striking her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), and
the bench, and everybody present, with awe. If anybody, of whatsoever
degree, said a word that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) didn't approve of, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) instantly required to
have it <div class="bookquote">``taken down.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>If anybody wouldn't make an admission, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) said,
<div class="bookquote">``I'll have it out of you!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and if anybody made an admission, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) said,
<div class="bookquote">``Now I have got you!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>The magistrates shivered under a single bite of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) finger. Thieves and thief-takers hung in dread rapture on his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) words,
and shrank when a hair of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) eyebrows turned in their direction. Which
side he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) was on I couldn't make out, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) seemed to me to be grinding
the whole place in a mill; I only know that when I stole out on tiptoe,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) was not on the side of the bench; for, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) was making the legs of the
old gentleman who presided, quite convulsive under the table, by his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>)
denunciations of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) conduct as the representative of British law and
justice in that chair that day.




<p/>Chapter XXV

<p/>Bentley Drummle, who was so sulky a fellow that he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) even took up a book
as if its writer had done him (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) an injury, did not take up an
acquaintance in a more agreeable spirit. Heavy in figure, movement,
and comprehension,--in the sluggish complexion of his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) face, and in
the large, awkward tongue that seemed to loll about in his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) mouth as
he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) himself lolled about in a room,--he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) was idle, proud, niggardly,
reserved, and suspicious. He (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) came of rich people down in Somersetshire,
who had nursed this combination of qualities until they made the
discovery that it was just of age and a blockhead. Thus, Bentley Drummle
had come to Mr. Pocket when he (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) was a head taller than that gentleman,
and half a dozen heads thicker than most gentlemen.

<p/>Startop had been spoilt by a weak mother and kept at home when he (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>)
ought to have been at school, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) was devotedly attached to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), and
admired her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) beyond measure. He (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) had a woman's delicacy of feature,
and was--<div class="bookquote">``as you may see, though you never saw her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>a woman</b></font>)</div>said Herbert to
me--<div class="bookquote">``exactly like his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) mother.''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>It was but natural that I should take to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) much more kindly than to Drummle, and that, even in the earliest
evenings of our boating, he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) and I should pull homeward abreast of one
another, conversing from boat to boat, while Bentley Drummle came up
in our wake alone, under the overhanging banks and among the rushes. He (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>)
would always creep in-shore like some uncomfortable amphibious creature,
even when the tide would have sent him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) fast upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) way; and I always
think of him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) as coming after us in the dark or by the back-water,
when our own two boats were breaking the sunset or the moonlight in
mid-stream.

<p/>Herbert was my intimate companion and friend. I presented him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) with a
half-share in my boat, which was the occasion of his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) often coming down
to Hammersmith; and my possession of a half-share in his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) chambers often
took me up to London. We used to walk between the two places at all
hours. I have an affection for the road yet -LRB-though it is not so
pleasant a road as it was then-RRB-, formed in the impressibility of untried
youth and hope.

<p/>When I had been in Mr. Pocket's family a month or two, Mr. and Mrs.
Camilla turned up. Camilla was Mr. Pocket's sister. Georgiana, whom I
had seen at Miss Havisham's on the same occasion, also turned up. She (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>)
was a cousin,--an indigestive single woman, who called her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) rigidity
religion, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) liver love. These people hated me with the hatred of
cupidity and disappointment. As a matter of course, they fawned upon
me in my prosperity with the basest meanness. Towards Mr. Pocket, as
a grown-up infant with no notion of his (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) own interests, they showed the
complacent forbearance I had heard them express. Mrs. Pocket they
held in contempt; but they allowed the poor soul to have been heavily
disappointed in life, because that shed a feeble reflected light upon
themselves.

<p/>These were the surroundings among which I settled down, and applied
myself to my education. I soon contracted expensive habits, and began
to spend an amount of money that within a few short months I should have
thought almost fabulous; but through good and evil I stuck to my books.
There was no other merit in this, than my having sense enough to feel
my deficiencies. Between Mr. Pocket and Herbert I got on fast; and, with
one or the other always at my elbow to give me the start I wanted, and
clear obstructions out of my road, I must have been as great a dolt as
Drummle if I had done less.

<p/>I had not seen Mr. Wemmick for some weeks, when I thought I would write
him (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) a note and propose to go home with him (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) on a certain evening. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>)
replied that it would give him (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) much pleasure, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) would expect
me at the office at six o’clock. Thither I went, and there I found him (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>),
putting the key of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) safe down his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) back as the clock struck.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Did you think of walking down to Walworth?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, <div class="bookquote">``if you approve.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very much,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div>was Wemmick's reply, ``for I have had my legs under the desk
all day, and shall be glad to stretch them. Now, I'll tell you what I
have got for supper, Mr. Pip. I have got a stewed steak,--which is
of home preparation,--and a cold roast fowl,--which is from the
cook's-shop. I think it's tender, because the master of the shop was a
Juryman in some cases of ours the other day, and we let him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) down easy.
I reminded him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) of it when I bought the fowl, and I said, ``Pick us out
a good one, old Briton, because if we had chosen to keep you in the box
another day or two, we could easily have done it.'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) said to that,
``Let me make you a present of the best fowl in the shop.<div class="bookquote">'' I let him (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>), of
course. As far as it goes, it's property and portable. You don't object
to an aged parent, I hope?''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>I really thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) was still speaking of the fowl, until he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) added,
<div class="bookquote">``Because I have got an aged parent at my place.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>I then said what
politeness required.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So, you haven't dined with Mr. Jaggers yet?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) pursued, as we walked
along.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not yet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) told me so this afternoon when he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) heard you were coming. I expect
you'll have an invitation to-morrow. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>)'s going to ask your pals, too.
Three of `em; ain't there?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Although I was not in the habit of counting Drummle as one of my
intimate associates, I answered, <div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>)'s going to ask the whole gang,'' (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>--I hardly felt complimented by
the word,--<div class="bookquote">``and whatever he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) gives you, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>)'ll give you good. Don't look
forward to variety, but you'll have excellence. And there's another rum
thing in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) house,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>proceeded Wemmick, after a moment's pause, as if
the remark followed on the housekeeper understood; <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) never lets a door
or window be fastened at night.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the housekeeper</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) never robbed?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's it!''  (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div>returned Wemmick. ``He (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) says, and gives it out publicly, ``I
want to see the man who'll rob me.'' Lord bless you, I have heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>), a
hundred times, if I have heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) once, say to regular cracksmen in our
front office, ``You know where I live; now, no bolt is ever drawn there;
why don't you do a stroke of business with me? Come; can't I tempt you?<div class="bookquote">''
Not a man of them, sir, would be bold enough to try it on, for love or
money.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They dread him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) so much?''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dread him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said Wemmick. <div class="bookquote">``I believe you they dread him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). Not but what
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s artful, even in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) defiance of them. No silver, sir. Britannia
metal, every spoon.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So they wouldn't have much,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I observed, <div class="bookquote">``even if they--''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! But he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would have much,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said Wemmick, cutting me short, <div class="bookquote">``and they
know it. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'d have their lives, and the lives of scores of `em. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'d
have all he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could get. And it's impossible to say what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) couldn't get,
if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) gave his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mind to it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>I was falling into meditation on my guardian's greatness, when Wemmick
remarked:--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``As to the absence of plate, that's only his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) natural depth, you know.
A river's its natural depth, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) natural depth. Look at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
watch-chain. That's real enough.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's very massive,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Massive?''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>repeated Wemmick. <div class="bookquote">``I think so. And his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) watch is a gold
repeater, and worth a hundred pound if it's worth a penny. Mr. Pip,
there are about seven hundred thieves in this town who know all about
that watch; there's not a man, a woman, or a child, among them, who
wouldn't identify the smallest link in that chain, and drop it as if it
was red hot, if inveigled into touching it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div><p/>At first with such discourse, and afterwards with conversation of a more
general nature, did Mr. Wemmick and I beguile the time and the road,
until he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) gave me to understand that we had arrived in the district of
Walworth.

<p/>It appeared to be a collection of back lanes, ditches, and little
gardens, and to present the aspect of a rather dull retirement.
Wemmick's house was a little wooden cottage in the midst of plots of
garden, and the top of it was cut out and painted like a battery mounted
with guns.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My own doing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div>said Wemmick. <div class="bookquote">``Looks pretty; don't it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I highly commended it, I think it was the smallest house I ever saw;
with the queerest gothic windows -LRB-by far the greater part of them sham-RRB-,
and a gothic door almost too small to get in at.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's a real flagstaff, you see,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div>said Wemmick, <div class="bookquote">``and on Sundays I
run up a real flag. Then look here. After I have crossed this bridge, I
hoist it up--so--and cut off the communication.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div><p/>The bridge was a plank, and it crossed a chasm about four feet wide
and two deep. But it was very pleasant to see the pride with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>)
hoisted it up and made it fast; smiling as he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) did so, with a relish and
not merely mechanically.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``At nine o’clock every night, Greenwich time,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div>said Wemmick, <div class="bookquote">``the gun
fires. There he (<font color='blue'><b>My</b></font>) is, you see! And when you hear him (<font color='blue'><b>My</b></font>) go, I think you'll
say he (<font color='blue'><b>My</b></font>)'s a Stinger.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div><p/>The piece of ordnance referred to, was mounted in a separate fortress,
constructed of lattice-work. It was protected from the weather by an
ingenious little tarpaulin contrivance in the nature of an umbrella.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then, at the back,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div>said Wemmick, <div class="bookquote">``out of sight, so as not to impede
the idea of fortifications,--for it's a principle with me, if you have
an idea, carry it out and keep it up,--I don't know whether that's your
opinion--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div><p/>I said, decidedly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``--At the back, there's a pig, and there are fowls and rabbits; then,
I knock together my own little frame, you see, and grow cucumbers; and
you'll judge at supper what sort of a salad I can raise. So, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div>said
Wemmick, smiling again, but seriously too, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) head, <div class="bookquote">``if you
can suppose the little place besieged, it would hold out a devil of a
time in point of provisions.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Then, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) conducted me to a bower about a dozen yards off, but which was
approached by such ingenious twists of path that it took quite a long
time to get at; and in this retreat our glasses were already set forth.
Our punch was cooling in an ornamental lake, on whose margin the bower
was raised. This piece of water -LRB-with an island in the middle which
might have been the salad for supper-RRB- was of a circular form, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) had
constructed a fountain in it, which, when you set a little mill going
and took a cork out of a pipe, played to that powerful extent that it
made the back of your hand quite wet.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am my own engineer, and my own carpenter, and my own plumber, and
my own gardener, and my own Jack of all Trades,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div>said Wemmick, in
acknowledging my compliments. <div class="bookquote">``Well; it's a good thing, you know. It
brushes the Newgate cobwebs away, and pleases the Aged. You wouldn't
mind being at once introduced to the Aged, would you? It wouldn't put
you out?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I expressed the readiness I felt, and we went into the castle. There
we found, sitting by a fire, a very old man in a flannel coat: clean,
cheerful, comfortable, and well cared for, but intensely deaf.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well aged parent,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div>said Wemmick, shaking hands with him (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) in a cordial
and jocose way, <div class="bookquote">``how am you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``All right, John; all right!''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>replied the old man.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here's Mr. Pip, aged parent,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div>said Wemmick, <div class="bookquote">``and I wish you could hear
his (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) name. Nod away at him (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>), Mr. Pip; that's what he (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) likes. Nod away at
him (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>), if you please, like winking!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``This is a fine place of my son's, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>cried the old man, while I
nodded as hard as I possibly could. <div class="bookquote">``This is a pretty pleasure-ground,
sir. This spot and these beautiful works upon it ought to be kept
together by the Nation, after my son's time, for the people's
enjoyment.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You're as proud of it as Punch; ain't you, Aged?''  (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div>said Wemmick,
contemplating the old man, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) hard face really softened; <div class="bookquote">``there's
a nod for you;''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>giving him (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) a tremendous one; <div class="bookquote">``there's another for you;''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>giving him (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) a still more tremendous one; <div class="bookquote">``you like that, don't you? If
you're not tired, Mr. Pip--though I know it's tiring to strangers--will
you tip him (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) one more? You can't think how it pleases him (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>I tipped him (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) several more, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) was in great spirits. We left him (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>)
bestirring himself to feed the fowls, and we sat down to our punch in
the arbor; where Wemmick told me, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) smoked a pipe, that it had taken
him (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) a good many years to bring the property up to its present pitch of
perfection.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it your own, Mr. Wemmick?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``O yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div>said Wemmick, <div class="bookquote">``I have got hold of it, a bit at a time. It's a
freehold, by George!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it indeed? I hope Mr. Jaggers admires it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never seen it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div>said Wemmick. <div class="bookquote">``Never heard of it. Never seen the Aged.
Never heard of him (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>). No; the office is one thing, and private life is
another. When I go into the office, I leave the Castle behind me, and
when I come into the Castle, I leave the office behind me. If it's not
in any way disagreeable to you, you'll oblige me by doing the same. I
don't wish it professionally spoken about.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Of course I felt my good faith involved in the observance of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>)
request. The punch being very nice, we sat there drinking it and
talking, until it was almost nine o’clock. <div class="bookquote">``Getting near gun-fire,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div>said
Wemmick then, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) laid down his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) pipe; <div class="bookquote">``it's the Aged's treat.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Proceeding into the Castle again, we found the Aged heating the poker,
with expectant eyes, as a preliminary to the performance of this great
nightly ceremony. Wemmick stood with his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) watch in his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) hand until the
moment was come for him (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) to take the red-hot poker from the Aged, and
repair to the battery. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) took it, and went out, and presently the
Stinger went off with a Bang that shook the crazy little box of a
cottage as if it must fall to pieces, and made every glass and teacup in
it ring. Upon this, the Aged--who I believe would have been blown out
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) arm-chair but for holding on by the elbows--cried out exultingly,
<div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>)'s fired! I heerd him (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>and I nodded at the old gentleman until it is
no figure of speech to declare that I absolutely could not see him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>).

<p/>The interval between that time and supper Wemmick devoted to showing
me his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) collection of curiosities. They were mostly of a felonious
character; comprising the pen with which a celebrated forgery had been
committed, a distinguished razor or two, some locks of hair, and several
manuscript confessions written under condemnation,--upon which Mr.
Wemmick set particular value as being, to use his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) own words, <div class="bookquote">``every one
of `em Lies, sir.''  (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div>These were agreeably dispersed among small specimens
of china and glass, various neat trifles made by the proprietor of the
museum, and some tobacco-stoppers carved by the Aged. They were all
displayed in that chamber of the Castle into which I had been first
inducted, and which served, not only as the general sitting-room but
as the kitchen too, if I might judge from a saucepan on the hob, and
a brazen bijou over the fireplace designed for the suspension of a
roasting-jack.

<p/>There was a neat little girl in attendance, who looked after the Aged in
the day. When she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had laid the supper-cloth, the bridge was lowered to
give her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) means of egress, and she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) withdrew for the night. The supper was
excellent; and though the Castle was rather subject to dry-rot insomuch
that it tasted like a bad nut, and though the pig might have been
farther off, I was heartily pleased with my whole entertainment. Nor was
there any drawback on my little turret bedroom, beyond there being such
a very thin ceiling between me and the flagstaff, that when I lay down
on my back in bed, it seemed as if I had to balance that pole on my
forehead all night.

<p/>Wemmick was up early in the morning, and I am afraid I heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>)
cleaning my boots. After that, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) fell to gardening, and I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) from
my gothic window pretending to employ the Aged, and nodding at him (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) in
a most devoted manner. Our breakfast was as good as the supper, and at
half-past eight precisely we started for Little Britain. By degrees,
Wemmick got dryer and harder as we went along, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) mouth tightened
into a post-office again. At last, when we got to his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) place of business
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) pulled out his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) key from his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) coat-collar, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) looked as unconscious
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) Walworth property as if the Castle and the drawbridge and the
arbor and the lake and the fountain and the Aged, had all been blown
into space together by the last discharge of the Stinger.




<p/>Chapter XXVI

<p/>It fell out as Wemmick had told me it would, that I had an early
opportunity of comparing my guardian's establishment with that of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>)
cashier and clerk. My guardian was in his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) room, washing his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) hands with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) scented soap, when I went into the office from Walworth; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>)
called me to him (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>), and gave me the invitation for myself and friends
which Wemmick had prepared me to receive. <div class="bookquote">``No ceremony,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) stipulated,
<div class="bookquote">``and no dinner dress, and say to-morrow.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>I asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) where we should
come to -LRB-for I had no idea where he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) lived-RRB-, and I believe it was in his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>)
general objection to make anything like an admission, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) replied,
<div class="bookquote">``Come here, and I'll take you home with me.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>I embrace this opportunity
of remarking that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) washed his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) clients off, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) were a surgeon or
a dentist. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) had a closet in his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) room, fitted up for the purpose, which
smelt of the scented soap like a perfumer's shop. It had an unusually
large jack-towel on a roller inside the door, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) would wash his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>)
hands, and wipe them and dry them all over this towel, whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) came
in from a police court or dismissed a client from his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) room. When I and
my friends repaired to him (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) at six o’clock next day, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) seemed to have
been engaged on a case of a darker complexion than usual, for we found
him (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) head butted into this closet, not only washing his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) hands,
but laving his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) face and gargling his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) throat. And even when he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) had
done all that, and had gone all round the jack-towel, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) took out his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>)
penknife and scraped the case out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) nails before he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) put his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) coat
on.

<p/>There were some people slinking about as usual when we passed out into
the street, who were evidently anxious to speak with him (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>); but there was
something so conclusive in the halo of scented soap which encircled
his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) presence, that they gave it up for that day. As we walked along
westward, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) was recognized ever and again by some face in the crowd of
the streets, and whenever that happened he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) talked louder to me; but
he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) never otherwise recognized anybody, or took notice that anybody
recognized him (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>).

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) conducted us to Gerrard Street, Soho, to a house on the south side of
that street. Rather a stately house of its kind, but dolefully in want
of painting, and with dirty windows. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) took out his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) key and opened the
door, and we all went into a stone hall, bare, gloomy, and little used.
So, up a dark brown staircase into a series of three dark brown rooms on
the first floor. There were carved garlands on the panelled walls, and
as he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) stood among them giving us welcome, I know what kind of loops I
thought they looked like.

<p/>Dinner was laid in the best of these rooms; the second was his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>)
dressing-room; the third, his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) bedroom. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) told us that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) held the whole
house, but rarely used more of it than we saw. The table was comfortably
laid--no silver in the service, of course--and at the side of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) chair
was a capacious dumb-waiter, with a variety of bottles and decanters on
it, and four dishes of fruit for dessert. I noticed throughout, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>)
kept everything under his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) own hand, and distributed everything himself.

<p/>There was a bookcase in the room; I saw from the backs of the books,
that they were about evidence, criminal law, criminal biography, trials,
acts of Parliament, and such things. The furniture was all very solid
and good, like his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) watch-chain. It had an official look, however, and
there was nothing merely ornamental to be seen. In a corner was a little
table of papers with a shaded lamp: so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) seemed to bring the
office home with him (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) in that respect too, and to wheel it out of an
evening and fall to work.

<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) had scarcely seen my three companions until now,--for he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) and I had
walked together,--he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) stood on the hearth-rug, after ringing the bell,
and took a searching look at them. To my surprise, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) seemed at once to
be principally if not solely interested in Drummle.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Pip,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>), putting his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) large hand on my shoulder and moving me to
the window, <div class="bookquote">``I don't know one from the other. Who's the Spider?''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The spider?''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The blotchy, sprawly, sulky fellow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's Bentley Drummle,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I replied; <div class="bookquote">``the one with the delicate face is
Startop.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Not making the least account of <div class="bookquote">``the one with the delicate face,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>)
returned, <div class="bookquote">``Bentley Drummle is his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) name, is it? I like the look of that
fellow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) immediately began to talk to Drummle: not at all deterred by his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>)
replying in his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) heavy reticent way, but apparently led on by it to screw
discourse out of him (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>). I was looking at the two, when there came between
me and them the housekeeper, with the first dish for the table.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) was a woman of about forty, I supposed,--but I may have thought her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>)
younger than she (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) was. Rather tall, of a lithe nimble figure, extremely
pale, with large faded eyes, and a quantity of streaming hair. I cannot
say whether any diseased affection of the heart caused her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) lips to be
parted as if she (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) were panting, and her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) face to bear a curious expression
of suddenness and flutter; but I know that I had been to see Macbeth at
the theatre, a night or two before, and that her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) face looked to me as if
it were all disturbed by fiery air, like the faces I had seen rise out
of the Witches' caldron.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) set the dish on, touched my guardian quietly on the arm with a
finger to notify that dinner was ready, and vanished. We took our seats
at the round table, and my guardian kept Drummle on one side of him (<font color='blue'><b>Macbeth</b></font>),
while Startop sat on the other. It was a noble dish of fish that the
housekeeper had put on table, and we had a joint of equally choice
mutton afterwards, and then an equally choice bird. Sauces, wines, all
the accessories we wanted, and all of the best, were given out by our
host from his (<font color='blue'><b>Macbeth</b></font>) dumb-waiter; and when they had made the circuit of the
table, he (<font color='blue'><b>Macbeth</b></font>) always put them back again. Similarly, he (<font color='blue'><b>Macbeth</b></font>) dealt us clean
plates and knives and forks, for each course, and dropped those just
disused into two baskets on the ground by his (<font color='blue'><b>Macbeth</b></font>) chair. No other attendant
than the housekeeper appeared. She (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) set on every dish; and I always saw
in her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) face, a face rising out of the caldron. Years afterwards, I made
a dreadful likeness of that woman, by causing a face that had no other
natural resemblance to it than it derived from flowing hair to pass
behind a bowl of flaming spirits in a dark room.

<p/>Induced to take particular notice of the housekeeper, both by her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>)
own striking appearance and by Wemmick's preparation, I observed
that whenever she (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) was in the room she (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) kept her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) eyes attentively on my
guardian, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) would remove her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) hands from any dish she (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) put
before him (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>), hesitatingly, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) dreaded his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) calling her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) back, and
wanted him (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) to speak when she (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) was nigh, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) had anything to say. I
fancied that I could detect in his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) manner a consciousness of this, and a
purpose of always holding her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) in suspense.

<p/>Dinner went off gayly, and although my guardian seemed to follow rather
than originate subjects, I knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) wrenched the weakest part of
our dispositions out of us. For myself, I found that I was expressing my
tendency to lavish expenditure, and to patronize Herbert, and to boast
of my great prospects, before I quite knew that I had opened my lips.
It was so with all of us, but with no one more than Drummle: the
development of whose inclination to gird in a grudging and suspicious
way at the rest, was screwed out of him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) before the fish was taken off.

<p/>It was not then, but when we had got to the cheese, that our
conversation turned upon our rowing feats, and that Drummle was rallied
for coming up behind of a night in that slow amphibious way of his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>).
Drummle upon this, informed our host that he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) much preferred our room to
our company, and that as to skill he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) was more than our master, and that
as to strength he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) could scatter us like chaff. By some invisible agency,
my guardian wound him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) up to a pitch little short of ferocity about this
trifle; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) fell to baring and spanning his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) arm to show how muscular
it was, and we all fell to baring and spanning our arms in a ridiculous
manner.

<p/>Now the housekeeper was at that time clearing the table; my guardian,
taking no heed of her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>), but with the side of his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) face turned from her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>),
was leaning back in his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) chair biting the side of his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) forefinger and
showing an interest in Drummle, that, to me, was quite inexplicable.
Suddenly, he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) clapped his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) large hand on the housekeeper's, like a trap,
as she (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) stretched it across the table. So suddenly and smartly did he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) do
this, that we all stopped in our foolish contention.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you talk of strength,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jaggers/Jaggers/MR. JAGGERS</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Jaggers, <div class="bookquote">``I'll show you a wrist.
Molly, let them see your wrist.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jaggers/Jaggers/MR. JAGGERS</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) entrapped hand was on the table, but she (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) had already put her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) other
hand behind her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) waist. <div class="bookquote">``Master,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) said, in a low voice, with her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) eyes
attentively and entreatingly fixed upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Don't.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll show you a wrist,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jaggers/Jaggers/MR. JAGGERS</b></font>)</div>repeated Mr. Jaggers, with an immovable
determination to show it. <div class="bookquote">``Molly, let them see your wrist.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Master,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) again murmured. <div class="bookquote">``Please!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Molly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jaggers/Jaggers/MR. JAGGERS</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Jaggers, not looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>), but obstinately looking
at the opposite side of the room, <div class="bookquote">``let them see both your wrists. Show
them. Come!''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) hand from hers, and turned that wrist up on the table. She (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>)
brought her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) other hand from behind her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>), and held the two out side by
side. The last wrist was much disfigured,--deeply scarred and scarred
across and across. When she (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) held her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) hands out she (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) took her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) eyes from
Mr. Jaggers, and turned them watchfully on every one of the rest of us
in succession.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There's power here,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jaggers/Jaggers/MR. JAGGERS</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Jaggers, coolly tracing out the sinews
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) forefinger. <div class="bookquote">``Very few men have the power of wrist that this
woman has. It's remarkable what mere force of grip there is in these
hands. I have had occasion to notice many hands; but I never saw
stronger in that respect, man's or woman's, than these.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>While he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) said these words in a leisurely, critical style, she (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) continued
to look at every one of us in regular succession as we sat. The moment
he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) ceased, she (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) again. <div class="bookquote">``That'll do, Molly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jaggers/Jaggers/MR. JAGGERS</b></font>)</div>said Mr.
Jaggers, giving her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) a slight nod; <div class="bookquote">``you have been admired, and can
go.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jaggers/Jaggers/MR. JAGGERS</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) withdrew her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) hands and went out of the room, and Mr. Jaggers,
putting the decanters on from his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) dumb-waiter, filled his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) glass and
passed round the wine.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``At half-past nine, gentlemen,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``we must break up. Pray make
the best use of your time. I am glad to see you all. Mr. Drummle, I
drink to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>If his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) object in singling out Drummle were to bring him (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) out still more,
it perfectly succeeded. In a sulky triumph, Drummle showed his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) morose
depreciation of the rest of us, in a more and more offensive degree,
until he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) became downright intolerable. Through all his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) stages, Mr.
Jaggers followed him (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) with the same strange interest. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) actually seemed
to serve as a zest to Mr. Jaggers's wine.

<p/>In our boyish want of discretion I dare say we took too much to drink,
and I know we talked too much. We became particularly hot upon some
boorish sneer of Drummle's, to the effect that we were too free with our
money. It led to my remarking, with more zeal than discretion, that it
came with a bad grace from him (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>), to whom Startop had lent money in my
presence but a week or so before.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Drummle/Bentley Drummle/Mrs. Bentley Drummle</b></font>)</div>retorted Drummle; <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Drummle</b></font>)'ll be paid.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Drummle/Bentley Drummle/Mrs. Bentley Drummle</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't mean to imply that he (<font color='blue'><b>Drummle</b></font>) won't,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, <div class="bookquote">``but it might make you
hold your tongue about us and our money, I should think.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You should think!''  (<font color='red'><b>Drummle/Bentley Drummle/Mrs. Bentley Drummle</b></font>)</div>retorted Drummle. <div class="bookquote">``Oh Lord!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I dare say,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I went on, meaning to be very severe, <div class="bookquote">``that you wouldn't
lend money to any of us if we wanted it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are right,''  (<font color='red'><b>Drummle/Bentley Drummle/Mrs. Bentley Drummle</b></font>)</div>said Drummle. <div class="bookquote">``I wouldn't lend one of you a sixpence. I
wouldn't lend anybody a sixpence.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Rather mean to borrow under those circumstances, I should say.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You should say,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>repeated Drummle. <div class="bookquote">``Oh Lord!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>This was so very aggravating--the more especially as I found myself
making no way against his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) surly obtuseness--that I said, disregarding
Herbert's efforts to check me,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, Mr. Drummle, since we are on the subject, I'll tell you what
passed between Herbert here and me, when you borrowed that money.''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't want to know what passed between Herbert there and you,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Drummle/Bentley Drummle/Mrs. Bentley Drummle</b></font>)</div>growled Drummle. And I think he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) added in a lower growl, that we might
both go to the devil and shake ourselves.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll tell you, however,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, <div class="bookquote">``whether you want to know or not. We
said that as you put it in your pocket very glad to get it, you seemed
to be immensely amused at his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) being so weak as to lend it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Drummle laughed outright, and sat laughing in our faces, with his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) hands
in his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) pockets and his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) round shoulders raised; plainly signifying that
it was quite true, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) despised us as asses all.

<p/>Hereupon Startop took him (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) in hand, though with a much better grace than
I had shown, and exhorted him (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) to be a little more agreeable. Startop,
being a lively, bright young fellow, and Drummle being the exact
opposite, the latter was always disposed to resent him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) as a direct
personal affront. He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) now retorted in a coarse, lumpish way, and Startop
tried to turn the discussion aside with some small pleasantry that made
us all laugh. Resenting this little success more than anything, Drummle,
without any threat or warning, pulled his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) hands out of his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) pockets,
dropped his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) round shoulders, swore, took up a large glass, and would
have flung it at his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) adversary's head, but for our entertainer's
dexterously seizing it at the instant when it was raised for that
purpose.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Gentlemen,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jaggers/Jaggers/MR. JAGGERS</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Jaggers, deliberately putting down the glass, and
hauling out his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) gold repeater by its massive chain, <div class="bookquote">``I am exceedingly
sorry to announce that it's half past nine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jaggers/Jaggers/MR. JAGGERS</b></font>)</div><p/>On this hint we all rose to depart. Before we got to the street door,
Startop was cheerily calling Drummle <div class="bookquote">``old boy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Drummle/Bentley Drummle/Mrs. Bentley Drummle</b></font>)</div>as if nothing had
happened. But the old boy was so far from responding, that he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) would not
even walk to Hammersmith on the same side of the way; so Herbert and I,
who remained in town, saw them going down the street on opposite sides;
Startop leading, and Drummle lagging behind in the shadow of the houses,
much as he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) was wont to follow in his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) boat.

<p/>As the door was not yet shut, I thought I would leave Herbert there for
a moment, and run upstairs again to say a word to my guardian. I found
him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) dressing-room surrounded by his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) stock of boots, already hard
at it, washing his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) hands of us.

<p/>I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) I had come up again to say how sorry I was that anything
disagreeable should have occurred, and that I hoped he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) would not blame
me much.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Pooh!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>), sluicing his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) face, and speaking through the
water-drops; <div class="bookquote">``it's nothing, Pip. I like that Spider though.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) had turned towards me now, and was shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) head, and blowing, and
towelling himself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am glad you like him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I--<div class="bookquote">``but I don't.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no,''  (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div>my guardian assented; <div class="bookquote">``don't have too much to do with him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>).
Keep as clear of him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) as you can. But I like the fellow, Pip; he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) is one
of the true sort. Why, if I was a fortune-teller--''

 (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div><p/>Looking out of the towel, he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) caught my eye.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But I am not a fortune-teller,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) said, letting his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) head drop into a
festoon of towel, and towelling away at his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) two ears. <div class="bookquote">``You know what I
am, don't you? Good night, Pip.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good night, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Spider</b></font>)</div><p/>In about a month after that, the Spider's time with Mr. Pocket was up
for good, and, to the great relief of all the house but Mrs. Pocket, he (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>)
went home to the family hole.




<p/>Chapter XXVII


<p/>``MY DEAR MR PIP:--

<p/>``I write this by request of Mr. Gargery, for to let you know that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gargery</b></font>)
is going to London in company with Mr. Wopsle and would be glad if
agreeable to be allowed to see you. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) would call at Barnard's Hotel
Tuesday morning at nine o’clock, when if not agreeable please leave
word. Your poor sister is much the same as when you left. We talk of you
in the kitchen every night, and wonder what you are saying and doing. If
now considered in the light of a liberty, excuse it for the love of
poor old days. No more, dear Mr. Pip, from your ever obliged, and
affectionate servant,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``BIDDY.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``P.S.. He (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) wishes me most particular to write what larks. He (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) says you will
understand. I hope and do not doubt it will be agreeable to see him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>),
even though a gentleman, for you had ever a good heart, and he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) is a
worthy, worthy man. I have read him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) all, excepting only the last little
sentence, and he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) wishes me most particular to write again what larks.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I received this letter by the post on Monday morning, and therefore its
appointment was for next day. Let me confess exactly with what feelings
I looked forward to Joe's coming.

<p/>Not with pleasure, though I was bound to him (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) by so many ties; no;
with considerable disturbance, some mortification, and a keen sense of
incongruity. If I could have kept him (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) away by paying money, I certainly
would have paid money. My greatest reassurance was that he (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) was coming
to Barnard's Inn, not to Hammersmith, and consequently would not fall
in Bentley Drummle's way. I had little objection to his (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) being seen by
Herbert or his (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) father, for both of whom I had a respect; but I had the
sharpest sensitiveness as to his (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) being seen by Drummle, whom I held in
contempt. So, throughout life, our worst weaknesses and meannesses are
usually committed for the sake of the people whom we most despise.

<p/>I had begun to be always decorating the chambers in some quite
unnecessary and inappropriate way or other, and very expensive those
wrestles with Barnard proved to be. By this time, the rooms were
vastly different from what I had found them, and I enjoyed the honor
of occupying a few prominent pages in the books of a neighboring
upholsterer. I had got on so fast of late, that I had even started a boy
in boots,--top boots,--in bondage and slavery to whom I might have been
said to pass my days. For, after I had made the monster -LRB-out of the
refuse of my washerwoman's family-RRB-, and had clothed him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) with a blue
coat, canary waistcoat, white cravat, creamy breeches, and the boots
already mentioned, I had to find him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) a little to do and a great deal
to eat; and with both of those horrible requirements he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) haunted my
existence.

<p/>This avenging phantom was ordered to be on duty at eight on Tuesday
morning in the hall, -LRB-it was two feet square, as charged for
floorcloth,-RRB- and Herbert suggested certain things for breakfast that he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>)
thought Joe would like. While I felt sincerely obliged to him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) for being
so interested and considerate, I had an odd half-provoked sense of
suspicion upon me, that if Joe had been coming to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) wouldn't
have been quite so brisk about it.

<p/>However, I came into town on the Monday night to be ready for Joe, and
I got up early in the morning, and caused the sitting-room and
breakfast-table to assume their most splendid appearance. Unfortunately
the morning was drizzly, and an angel could not have concealed the fact
that Barnard was shedding sooty tears outside the window, like some weak
giant of a Sweep.

<p/>As the time approached I should have liked to run away, but the Avenger
pursuant to orders was in the hall, and presently I heard Joe on
the staircase. I knew it was Joe, by his (<font color='blue'><b>Barnard</b></font>) clumsy manner of coming upstairs,
--his (<font color='blue'><b>Barnard</b></font>) state boots being always too big for him (<font color='blue'><b>Barnard</b></font>),--and by the time
it took him (<font color='blue'><b>Barnard</b></font>) to read the names on the other floors in the course of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Barnard</b></font>) ascent. When at last he (<font color='blue'><b>Barnard</b></font>) stopped outside our door, I could hear his (<font color='blue'><b>Barnard</b></font>)
finger tracing over the painted letters of my name, and I afterwards
distinctly heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Barnard</b></font>) breathing in at the keyhole. Finally he (<font color='blue'><b>Barnard</b></font>) gave a
faint single rap, and Pepper--such was the compromising name of the
avenging boy--announced <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Gargery!''  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div>I thought he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) never would have
done wiping his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) feet, and that I must have gone out to lift him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) off the
mat, but at last he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) came in.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Joe, how are you, Joe?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pip, how AIR you, Pip?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>With his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) good honest face all glowing and shining, and his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) hat put
down on the floor between us, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) caught both my hands and worked them
straight up and down, as if I had been the last-patented Pump.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am glad to see you, Joe. Give me your hat.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div><p/>But Joe, taking it up carefully with both hands, like a bird's-nest with
eggs in it, wouldn't hear of parting with that piece of property, and
persisted in standing talking over it in a most uncomfortable way.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Which you have that growed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>said Joe, <div class="bookquote">``and that swelled, and that
gentle-folked;''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>Joe considered a little before he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) discovered this word;
<div class="bookquote">``as to be sure you are a honor to your king and country.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you, Joe, look wonderfully well.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank God,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>said Joe, <div class="bookquote">``I'm ekerval to most. And your sister, she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>)'s
no worse than she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) were. And Biddy, she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>)'s ever right and ready. And all
friends is no backerder, if not no forarder. `Ceptin Wopsle; he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)'s had a
drop.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div><p/>All this time -LRB-still with both hands taking great care of the
bird's-nest-RRB-, Joe was rolling his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) eyes round and round the room, and
round and round the flowered pattern of my dressing-gown.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Had a drop, Joe?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>said Joe, lowering his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) voice, <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)'s left the Church and went
into the playacting. Which the playacting have likeways brought him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)
to London along with me. And his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) wish were,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>said Joe, getting the
bird's-nest under his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) left arm for the moment, and groping in it for an
egg with his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) right; <div class="bookquote">``if no offence, as I would `and you that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div><p/>I took what Joe gave me, and found it to be the crumpled play-bill of
a small metropolitan theatre, announcing the first appearance, in that
very week, of <div class="bookquote">``the celebrated Provincial Amateur of Roscian renown,
whose unique performance in the highest tragic walk of our National Bard
has lately occasioned so great a sensation in local dramatic circles.''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Were you at his (<font color='blue'><b>Bard</b></font>) performance, Joe?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I inquired.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I were,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>said Joe, with emphasis and solemnity.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Was there a great sensation?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>said Joe, ``yes, there certainly were a peck of orange-peel.
Partickler when he (<font color='blue'><b>Bard</b></font>) see the ghost. Though I put it to yourself, sir,
whether it were calc'lated to keep a man up to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) work with a good
hart, to be continiwally cutting in betwixt him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and the Ghost with
``Amen!<div class="bookquote">'' A man may have had a misfortun' and been in the Church,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>said
Joe, lowering his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) voice to an argumentative and feeling tone, <div class="bookquote">``but
that is no reason why you should put him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) out at such a time. Which I
meantersay, if the ghost of a man's own father cannot be allowed to
claim his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) attention, what can, Sir? Still more, when his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) mourning `at
is unfortunately made so small as that the weight of the black feathers
brings it off, try to keep it on how you may.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div><p/>A ghost-seeing effect in Joe's own countenance informed me that Herbert
had entered the room. So, I presented Joe to Herbert, who held out his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>)
hand; but Joe backed from it, and held on by the bird's-nest.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your servant, Sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>said Joe, <div class="bookquote">``which I hope as you and Pip'' (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>--here his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>)
eye fell on the Avenger, who was putting some toast on table, and so
plainly denoted an intention to make that young gentleman one of the
family, that I frowned it down and confused him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) more--<div class="bookquote">``I meantersay, you
two gentlemen,--which I hope as you get your elths in this close spot?
For the present may be a werry good inn, according to London opinions,''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>said Joe, confidentially, <div class="bookquote">``and I believe its character do stand it; but I
wouldn't keep a pig in it myself,--not in the case that I wished him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) to
fatten wholesome and to eat with a meller flavor on him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div><p/>Having borne this flattering testimony to the merits of our
dwelling-place, and having incidentally shown this tendency to call me
<div class="bookquote">``sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>Joe, being invited to sit down to table, looked all round the
room for a suitable spot on which to deposit his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) hat,--as if it were
only on some very few rare substances in nature that it could find a
resting place,--and ultimately stood it on an extreme corner of the
chimney-piece, from which it ever afterwards fell off at intervals.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you take tea, or coffee, Mr. Gargery?''  (<font color='red'><b>Herbert/Herbert Pocket</b></font>)</div>asked Herbert, who always
presided of a morning.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thankee, Sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>said Joe, stiff from head to foot, <div class="bookquote">``I'll take whichever
is most agreeable to yourself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you say to coffee?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thankee, Sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>returned Joe, evidently dispirited by the proposal,
<div class="bookquote">``since you are so kind as make chice of coffee, I will not run contrairy
to your own opinions. But don't you never find it a little `eating?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Say tea then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Herbert/Herbert Pocket</b></font>)</div>said Herbert, pouring it out.

<p/>Here Joe's hat tumbled off the mantel-piece, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) started out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>)
chair and picked it up, and fitted it to the same exact spot. As if it
were an absolute point of good breeding that it should tumble off again
soon.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``When did you come to town, Mr. Gargery?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Were it yesterday afternoon?''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>said Joe, after coughing behind his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) hand,
as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) had had time to catch the whooping-cough since he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) came. <div class="bookquote">``No
it were not. Yes it were. Yes. It were yesterday afternoon''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>-LRB-with an
appearance of mingled wisdom, relief, and strict impartiality-RRB-.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you seen anything of London yet?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, yes, Sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>said Joe, <div class="bookquote">``me and Wopsle went off straight to look at
the Blacking Ware’us. But we didn't find that it come up to its likeness
in the red bills at the shop doors; which I meantersay,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>added Joe, in
an explanatory manner, <div class="bookquote">``as it is there drawd too architectooralooral.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div><p/>I really believe Joe would have prolonged this word -LRB-mightily expressive
to my mind of some architecture that I know-RRB- into a perfect Chorus, but
for his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) attention being providentially attracted by his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) hat, which
was toppling. Indeed, it demanded from him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) a constant attention, and a
quickness of eye and hand, very like that exacted by wicket-keeping.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) made extraordinary play with it, and showed the greatest skill; now,
rushing at it and catching it neatly as it dropped; now, merely stopping
it midway, beating it up, and humoring it in various parts of the room
and against a good deal of the pattern of the paper on the wall,
before he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) felt it safe to close with it; finally splashing it into the
slop-basin, where I took the liberty of laying hands upon it.

<p/>As to his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) shirt-collar, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) coat-collar, they were perplexing to
reflect upon,--insoluble mysteries both. Why should a man scrape himself
to that extent, before he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could consider himself full dressed? Why
should he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) suppose it necessary to be purified by suffering for
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) holiday clothes? Then he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fell into such unaccountable fits of
meditation, with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fork midway between his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) plate and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mouth; had
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes attracted in such strange directions; was afflicted with such
remarkable coughs; sat so far from the table, and dropped so much
more than he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ate, and pretended that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hadn't dropped it; that I was
heartily glad when Herbert left us for the City.

<p/>I had neither the good sense nor the good feeling to know that this was
all my fault, and that if I had been easier with Joe, Joe would have
been easier with me. I felt impatient of him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) and out of temper with him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>);
in which condition he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) heaped coals of fire on my head.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Us two being now alone, sir,'' (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>--began Joe.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Joe,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I interrupted, pettishly, <div class="bookquote">``how can you call me, sir?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Joe looked at me for a single instant with something faintly like
reproach. Utterly preposterous as his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) cravat was, and as his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) collars
were, I was conscious of a sort of dignity in the look.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Us two being now alone,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>resumed Joe, <div class="bookquote">``and me having the intentions and
abilities to stay not many minutes more, I will now conclude--leastways
begin--to mention what have led to my having had the present honor. For
was it not,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>said Joe, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) old air of lucid exposition, <div class="bookquote">``that my
only wish were to be useful to you, I should not have had the honor of
breaking wittles in the company and abode of gentlemen.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div><p/>I was so unwilling to see the look again, that I made no remonstrance
against this tone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>pursued Joe, <div class="bookquote">``this is how it were. I were at the Bargemen
t'other night, Pip;'' (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>--whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) subsided into affection, he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) called me
Pip, and whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) relapsed into politeness he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) called me sir; <div class="bookquote">``when

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>said Joe, going down a new track, <div class="bookquote">``do comb my `air the wrong way
sometimes, awful, by giving out up and down town as it were him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) which

 (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nonsense. It was you, Joe.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Which I fully believed it were, Pip,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>said Joe, slightly tossing
his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) head, ``though it signify little now, sir. Well, Pip; this same
identical, which his (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) manners is given to blusterous, come to me at

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Havisham, Joe?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>```She (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) wish,' were Pumblechook's word, `to speak to you.''' Joe sat and
rolled his (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) eyes at the ceiling.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Joe? Go on, please.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Next day, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>said Joe, looking at me as if I were a long way off,
<div class="bookquote">``having cleaned myself, I go and I see Miss A.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss A., Joe? Miss Havisham?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Which I say, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>replied Joe, with an air of legal formality, as if
he (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) were making his (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) will, ``Miss A., or otherways Havisham. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) expression
air then as follering: `Mr. Gargery. You air in correspondence with Mr.
Pip?' Having had a letter from you, I were able to say `I am.' -LRB-When
I married your sister, sir, I said `I will;' and when I answered your
friend, Pip, I said `I am.'-RRB- `Would you tell him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>), then,' said she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>), `that
which Estella has come home and would be glad to see him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>).'''

<p/>I felt my face fire up as I looked at Joe. I hope one remote cause
of its firing may have been my consciousness that if I had known his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)
errand, I should have given him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) more encouragement.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Biddy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>pursued Joe, <div class="bookquote">``when I got home and asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) fur to write the

<div class="bookquote">``and, Pip, I wish you ever well and ever prospering to a greater and a

 (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you are not going now, Joe?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes I am,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>said Joe.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But you are coming back to dinner, Joe?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No I am not,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>said Joe.

<p/>Our eyes met, and all the <div class="bookquote">``Sir''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>melted out of that manly heart as he (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) gave
me his (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Pip, dear old chap, life is made of ever so many partings welded
together, as I may say, and one man's a blacksmith, and one's a
whitesmith, and one's a goldsmith, and one's a coppersmith. Diwisions
among such must come, and must be met as they come. If there's been
any fault at all to-day, it's mine. You and me is not two figures to
be together in London; nor yet anywheres else but what is private, and
beknown, and understood among friends. It ain't that I am proud, but
that I want to be right, as you shall never see me no more in these
clothes. I'm wrong in these clothes. I'm wrong out of the forge, the
kitchen, or off th' meshes. You won't find half so much fault in me if
you think of me in my forge dress, with my hammer in my hand, or even
my pipe. You won't find half so much fault in me if, supposing as you
should ever wish to see me, you come and put your head in at the forge
window and see Joe the blacksmith, there, at the old anvil, in the old
burnt apron, sticking to the old work. I'm awful dull, but I hope I've
beat out something nigh the rights of this at last. And so GOD bless
you, dear old Pip, old chap, GOD bless you!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I had not been mistaken in my fancy that there was a simple dignity
in him (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>). The fashion of his (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) dress could no more come in its way when he (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>)
spoke these words than it could come in its way in Heaven. He (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) touched me
gently on the forehead, and went out. As soon as I could recover
myself sufficiently, I hurried out after him (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) and looked for him (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) in the
neighboring streets; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) was gone.




<p/>Chapter XXVIII

<p/>It was clear that I must repair to our town next day, and in the first
flow of my repentance, it was equally clear that I must stay at Joe's.
But, when I had secured my box-place by to-morrow's coach, and had been
down to Mr. Pocket's and back, I was not by any means convinced on the
last point, and began to invent reasons and make excuses for putting
up at the Blue Boar. I should be an inconvenience at Joe's; I was not
expected, and my bed would not be ready; I should be too far from
Miss Havisham's, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) was exacting and mightn't like it. All other
swindlers upon earth are nothing to the self-swindlers, and with such
pretences did I cheat myself. Surely a curious thing. That I should
innocently take a bad half-crown of somebody else's manufacture is
reasonable enough; but that I should knowingly reckon the spurious coin
of my own make as good money! An obliging stranger, under pretence of
compactly folding up my bank-notes for security's sake, abstracts the
notes and gives me nutshells; but what is his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) sleight of hand to mine,
when I fold up my own nutshells and pass them on myself as notes!

<p/>Having settled that I must go to the Blue Boar, my mind was much
disturbed by indecision whether or not to take the Avenger. It was
tempting to think of that expensive Mercenary publicly airing his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) boots
in the archway of the Blue Boar's posting-yard; it was almost solemn to
imagine him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) casually produced in the tailor's shop, and confounding
the disrespectful senses of Trabb's boy. On the other hand, Trabb's boy
might worm himself into his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) intimacy and tell him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) things; or, reckless
and desperate wretch as I knew he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) could be, might hoot him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) in the High
Street. My patroness, too, might hear of him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), and not approve. On the
whole, I resolved to leave the Avenger behind.

<p/>It was the afternoon coach by which I had taken my place, and, as winter
had now come round, I should not arrive at my destination until two or
three hours after dark. Our time of starting from the Cross Keys was
two o’clock. I arrived on the ground with a quarter of an hour to spare,
attended by the Avenger,--if I may connect that expression with one who
never attended on me if he (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) could possibly help it.

<p/>At that time it was customary to carry Convicts down to the dock-yards
by stage-coach. As I had often heard of them in the capacity of outside
passengers, and had more than once seen them on the high road dangling
their ironed legs over the coach roof, I had no cause to be surprised
when Herbert, meeting me in the yard, came up and told me there were two
convicts going down with me. But I had a reason that was an old reason
now for constitutionally faltering whenever I heard the word <div class="bookquote">``convict.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't mind them, Handel?''  (<font color='red'><b>Herbert/Herbert Pocket</b></font>)</div>said Herbert.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``O no!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought you seemed as if you didn't like them?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't pretend that I do like them, and I suppose you don't
particularly. But I don't mind them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``See! There they are,''  (<font color='red'><b>Herbert/Herbert Pocket</b></font>)</div>said Herbert, <div class="bookquote">``coming out of the Tap. What a
degraded and vile sight it is!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Herbert/Herbert Pocket</b></font>)</div><p/>They had been treating their guard, I suppose, for they had a gaoler
with them, and all three came out wiping their mouths on their hands.
The two convicts were handcuffed together, and had irons on their
legs,--irons of a pattern that I knew well. They wore the dress that I
likewise knew well. Their keeper had a brace of pistols, and carried
a thick-knobbed bludgeon under his (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>) arm; but he (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>) was on terms of good
understanding with them, and stood with them beside him (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>), looking on at
the putting-to of the horses, rather with an air as if the convicts were
an interesting Exhibition not formally open at the moment, and he (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>) the
Curator. One was a taller and stouter man than the other, and appeared
as a matter of course, according to the mysterious ways of the world,
both convict and free, to have had allotted to him (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>) the smaller suit of
clothes. His (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>) arms and legs were like great pincushions of those shapes,
and his (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>) attire disguised him (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>) absurdly; but I knew his (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>) half-closed eye
at one glance. There stood the man whom I had seen on the settle at the
Three Jolly Bargemen on a Saturday night, and who had brought me down
with his (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>) invisible gun!

<p/>It was easy to make sure that as yet he (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>) knew me no more than if he (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>) had
never seen me in his (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>) life. He (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>) looked across at me, and his (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>) eye appraised
my watch-chain, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>) incidentally spat and said something to the
other convict, and they laughed and slued themselves round with a clink
of their coupling manacle, and looked at something else. The great
numbers on their backs, as if they were street doors; their coarse mangy
ungainly outer surface, as if they were lower animals; their ironed
legs, apologetically garlanded with pocket-handkerchiefs; and the way
in which all present looked at them and kept from them; made them -LRB-as
Herbert had said-RRB- a most disagreeable and degraded spectacle.

<p/>But this was not the worst of it. It came out that the whole of the back
of the coach had been taken by a family removing from London, and that
there were no places for the two prisoners but on the seat in front
behind the coachman. Hereupon, a choleric gentleman, who had taken the
fourth place on that seat, flew into a most violent passion, and said
that it was a breach of contract to mix him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) up with such villainous
company, and that it was poisonous, and pernicious, and infamous, and
shameful, and I don't know what else. At this time the coach was ready
and the coachman impatient, and we were all preparing to get up, and
the prisoners had come over with their keeper,--bringing with them that
curious flavor of bread-poultice, baize, rope-yarn, and hearthstone,
which attends the convict presence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't take it so much amiss, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>the keeper</b></font>)</div>pleaded the keeper to the angry
passenger; <div class="bookquote">``I'll sit next you myself. I'll put `em on the outside of
the row. They won't interfere with you, sir. You needn't know they're
there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the passenger</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And don't blame me,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>growled the convict I had recognized. <div class="bookquote">``I don't
want to go. I am quite ready to stay behind. As fur as I am concerned
any one's welcome to my place.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Or mine,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the other, gruffly. <div class="bookquote">``I wouldn't have incommoded none
of you, if I'd had my way.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Then they both laughed, and began cracking
nuts, and spitting the shells about.--As I really think I should have
liked to do myself, if I had been in their place and so despised.

<p/>At length, it was voted that there was no help for the angry gentleman,
and that he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) must either go in his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) chance company or remain behind. So he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
got into his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) place, still making complaints, and the keeper got into the
place next him (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>), and the convicts hauled themselves up as well as they
could, and the convict I had recognized sat behind me with his (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>) breath on
the hair of my head.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good-bye, Handel!''  (<font color='red'><b>Herbert/Herbert Pocket</b></font>)</div>Herbert called out as we started. I thought what a
blessed fortune it was, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) had found another name for me than Pip.

<p/>It is impossible to express with what acuteness I felt the convict's
breathing, not only on the back of my head, but all along my spine. The
sensation was like being touched in the marrow with some pungent and
searching acid, it set my very teeth on edge. He (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) seemed to have more
breathing business to do than another man, and to make more noise in
doing it; and I was conscious of growing high-shouldered on one side, in
my shrinking endeavors to fend him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) off.

<p/>The weather was miserably raw, and the two cursed the cold. It made us
all lethargic before we had gone far, and when we had left the Half-way
House behind, we habitually dozed and shivered and were silent. I dozed
off, myself, in considering the question whether I ought to restore a
couple of pounds sterling to this creature before losing sight of him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>),
and how it could best be done. In the act of dipping forward as if I
were going to bathe among the horses, I woke in a fright and took the
question up again.

<p/>But I must have lost it longer than I had thought, since, although
I could recognize nothing in the darkness and the fitful lights and
shadows of our lamps, I traced marsh country in the cold damp wind that
blew at us. Cowering forward for warmth and to make me a screen against
the wind, the convicts were closer to me than before. The very first
words I heard them interchange as I became conscious, were the words of
my own thought, <div class="bookquote">``Two One Pound notes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How did he (<font color='blue'><b>Handel</b></font>) get `em?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said the convict I had never seen.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How should I know?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>returned the other. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Handel</b></font>) had `em stowed away
somehows. Giv him (<font color='blue'><b>Handel</b></font>) by friends, I expect.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the other, with a bitter curse upon the cold, <div class="bookquote">``that I had
`em here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Two one pound notes, or friends?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Two one pound notes. I'd sell all the friends I ever had for one, and
think it a blessed good bargain. Well? So he (<font color='blue'><b>Handel</b></font>) says--?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So he (<font color='blue'><b>Handel</b></font>) says,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>resumed the convict I had recognized,--<div class="bookquote">``it was all
said and done in half a minute, behind a pile of timber in the
Dock-yard,--`You're a going to be discharged?' Yes, I was. Would I find
out that boy that had fed him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) and kep his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) secret, and give him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) them two
one pound notes? Yes, I would. And I did.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``More fool you,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>growled the other. <div class="bookquote">``I'd have spent `em on a Man, in
wittles and drink. He (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) must have been a green one. Mean to say he (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) knowed
nothing of you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not a ha'porth. Different gangs and different ships. He (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) was tried again
for prison breaking, and got made a Lifer.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And was that--Honor!--the only time you worked out, in this part of the
country?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The only time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What might have been your opinion of the place?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A most beastly place. Mudbank, mist, swamp, and work; work, swamp,
mist, and mudbank.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They both execrated the place in very strong language, and gradually
growled themselves out, and had nothing left to say.

<p/>After overhearing this dialogue, I should assuredly have got down and
been left in the solitude and darkness of the highway, but for feeling
certain that the man had no suspicion of my identity. Indeed, I was not
only so changed in the course of nature, but so differently dressed and
so differently circumstanced, that it was not at all likely he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could
have known me without accidental help. Still, the coincidence of our
being together on the coach, was sufficiently strange to fill me with a
dread that some other coincidence might at any moment connect me, in his (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>)
hearing, with my name. For this reason, I resolved to alight as soon as
we touched the town, and put myself out of his (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) hearing. This device I
executed successfully. My little portmanteau was in the boot under my
feet; I had but to turn a hinge to get it out; I threw it down before
me, got down after it, and was left at the first lamp on the first
stones of the town pavement. As to the convicts, they went their way
with the coach, and I knew at what point they would be spirited off to
the river. In my fancy, I saw the boat with its convict crew waiting for
them at the slime-washed stairs,--again heard the gruff <div class="bookquote">``Give way, you!''
 (<font color='red'><b>crew</b></font>)</div>like and order to dogs,--again saw the wicked Noah's Ark lying out on
the black water.

<p/>I could not have said what I was afraid of, for my fear was altogether
undefined and vague, but there was great fear upon me. As I walked on to
the hotel, I felt that a dread, much exceeding the mere apprehension of
a painful or disagreeable recognition, made me tremble. I am confident
that it took no distinctness of shape, and that it was the revival for a
few minutes of the terror of childhood.

<p/>The coffee-room at the Blue Boar was empty, and I had not only ordered
my dinner there, but had sat down to it, before the waiter knew me. As
soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) had apologized for the remissness of his (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) memory, he (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) asked me
if he (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) should send Boots for Mr. Pumblechook?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, <div class="bookquote">``certainly not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>The waiter -LRB-it was he (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) who had brought up the Great Remonstrance from the
Commercials, on the day when I was bound-RRB- appeared surprised, and
took the earliest opportunity of putting a dirty old copy of a local
newspaper so directly in my way, that I took it up and read this
paragraph:--

<p/>Our readers will learn, not altogether without interest, in reference to
the recent romantic rise in fortune of a young artificer in iron of this
neighborhood -LRB-what a theme, by the way, for the magic pen of our as yet
not universally acknowledged townsman TOOBY, the poet of our columns!-RRB-
that the youth's earliest patron, companion, and friend, was a highly
respected individual not entirely unconnected with the corn and seed
trade, and whose eminently convenient and commodious business premises
are situate within a hundred miles of the High Street. It is not wholly
irrespective of our personal feelings that we record HIM as the Mentor
of our young Telemachus, for it is good to know that our town produced
the founder of the latter's fortunes. Does the thought-contracted brow
of the local Sage or the lustrous eye of local Beauty inquire whose
fortunes? We believe that Quintin Matsys was the BLACKSMITH of Antwerp.
VERB. SAP.

<p/>I entertain a conviction, based upon large experience, that if in the
days of my prosperity I had gone to the North Pole, I should have met
somebody there, wandering Esquimaux or civilized man, who would have
told me that Pumblechook was my earliest patron and the founder of my
fortunes.




<p/>Chapter XXIX

<p/>Betimes in the morning I was up and out. It was too early yet to go to
Miss Havisham's, so I loitered into the country on Miss Havisham's
side of town,--which was not Joe's side; I could go there
to-morrow,--thinking about my patroness, and painting brilliant pictures
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) plans for me.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) had adopted Estella, she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) had as good as adopted me, and it could not
fail to be her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) intention to bring us together. She (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) reserved it for me to
restore the desolate house, admit the sunshine into the dark rooms,
set the clocks a-going and the cold hearths a-blazing, tear down the
cobwebs, destroy the vermin,--in short, do all the shining deeds of the
young Knight of romance, and marry the Princess. I had stopped to
look at the house as I passed; and its seared red brick walls, blocked
windows, and strong green ivy clasping even the stacks of chimneys with
its twigs and tendons, as if with sinewy old arms, had made up a rich
attractive mystery, of which I was the hero. Estella was the inspiration
of it, and the heart of it, of course. But, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) had taken such
strong possession of me, though my fancy and my hope were so set upon
her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>), though her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) influence on my boyish life and character had been
all-powerful, I did not, even that romantic morning, invest her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) with any
attributes save those she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) possessed. I mention this in this place, of a
fixed purpose, because it is the clew by which I am to be followed into
my poor labyrinth. According to my experience, the conventional notion
of a lover cannot be always true. The unqualified truth is, that when I
loved Estella with the love of a man, I loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) simply because I found
her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) irresistible. Once for all; I knew to my sorrow, often and often,
if not always, that I loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) against reason, against promise, against
peace, against hope, against happiness, against all discouragement that
could be. Once for all; I loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) none the less because I knew it,
and it had no more influence in restraining me than if I had devoutly
believed her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) to be human perfection.

<p/>I so shaped out my walk as to arrive at the gate at my old time. When
I had rung at the bell with an unsteady hand, I turned my back upon the
gate, while I tried to get my breath and keep the beating of my heart
moderately quiet. I heard the side-door open, and steps come across the
courtyard; but I pretended not to hear, even when the gate swung on its
rusty hinges.

<p/>Being at last touched on the shoulder, I started and turned. I started
much more naturally then, to find myself confronted by a man in a sober
gray dress. The last man I should have expected to see in that place of
porter at Miss Havisham's door.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Orlick!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, young master, there's more changes than yours. But come in, come
in. It's opposed to my orders to hold the gate open.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I entered and he (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) swung it, and locked it, and took the key out. <div class="bookquote">``Yes!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>), facing round, after doggedly preceding me a few steps towards
the house. <div class="bookquote">``Here I am!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How did you come here?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I come her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) retorted, <div class="bookquote">``on my legs. I had my box brought alongside
me in a barrow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you here for good?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I ain't here for harm, young master, I suppose?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I was not so sure of that. I had leisure to entertain the retort in my
mind, while he (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) slowly lifted his (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) heavy glance from the pavement, up my
legs and arms, to my face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then you have left the forge?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do this look like a forge?''  (<font color='red'><b>Orlick/Old Orlick</b></font>)</div>replied Orlick, sending his (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) glance all
round him (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) with an air of injury. <div class="bookquote">``Now, do it look like it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) how long he (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) had left Gargery's forge?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``One day is so like another here,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) replied, <div class="bookquote">``that I don't know
without casting it up. However, I come here some time since you left.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I could have told you that, Orlick.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>), dryly. <div class="bookquote">``But then you've got to be a scholar.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>By this time we had come to the house, where I found his (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) room to be one
just within the side-door, with a little window in it looking on the
courtyard. In its small proportions, it was not unlike the kind of place
usually assigned to a gate-porter in Paris. Certain keys were hanging on
the wall, to which he (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) now added the gate key; and his (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) patchwork-covered
bed was in a little inner division or recess. The whole had a slovenly,
confined, and sleepy look, like a cage for a human dormouse; while he (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>),
looming dark and heavy in the shadow of a corner by the window, looked
like the human dormouse for whom it was fitted up,--as indeed he (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) was.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I never saw this room before,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I remarked; <div class="bookquote">``but there used to be no
Porter here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``not till it got about that there was no protection on
the premises, and it come to be considered dangerous, with convicts and
Tag and Rag and Bobtail going up and down. And then I was recommended to
the place as a man who could give another man as good as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) brought, and
I took it. It's easier than bellowsing and hammering.--That's loaded,
that is.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>My eye had been caught by a gun with a brass-bound stock over the
chimney-piece, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) eye had followed mine.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, not desirous of more conversation, <div class="bookquote">``shall I go up to
Miss Havisham?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Burn me, if I know!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) retorted, first stretching himself and then
shaking himself; <div class="bookquote">``my orders ends here, young master. I give this here
bell a rap with this here hammer, and you go on along the passage till
you meet somebody.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am expected, I believe?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Burn me twice over, if I can say!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>).

<p/>Upon that, I turned down the long passage which I had first trodden in
my thick boots, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) made his (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) bell sound. At the end of the passage,
while the bell was still reverberating, I found Sarah Pocket, who
appeared to have now become constitutionally green and yellow by reason
of me.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``You, is it, Mr. Pip?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is, Miss Pocket. I am glad to tell you that Mr. Pocket and family
are all well.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Are they any wiser?''  (<font color='red'><b>Sarah Pocket/Sarah/Miss Sarah Pocket</b></font>)</div>said Sarah, with a dismal shake of the head; <div class="bookquote">``they
had better be wiser, than well. Ah, Matthew, Matthew! You know your way,
sir?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sarah Pocket/Sarah/Miss Sarah Pocket</b></font>)</div><p/>Tolerably, for I had gone up the staircase in the dark, many a time. I
ascended it now, in lighter boots than of yore, and tapped in my old
way at the door of Miss Havisham's room. <div class="bookquote">``Pip's rap,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) say,
immediately; <div class="bookquote">``come in, Pip.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) was in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) chair near the old table, in the old dress, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) two
hands crossed on her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) stick, her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) chin resting on them, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) eyes on
the fire. Sitting near her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>), with the white shoe, that had never been
worn, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) hand, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) head bent as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) looked at it, was an elegant
lady whom I had never seen.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come in, Pip,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Havisham</b></font>)</div>Miss Havisham continued to mutter, without looking round
or up; <div class="bookquote">``come in, Pip, how do you do, Pip? so you kiss my hand as if I
were a queen, eh?--Well?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Havisham</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) looked up at me suddenly, only moving her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) eyes, and repeated in a
grimly playful manner,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well?''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I heard, Miss Havisham,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, rather at a loss, <div class="bookquote">``that you were so
kind as to wish me to come and see you, and I came directly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well?''

 (<font color='red'><b>The lady</b></font>)</div><p/>The lady whom I had never seen before, lifted up her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) eyes and looked
archly at me, and then I saw that the eyes were Estella's eyes. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>)
was so much changed, was so much more beautiful, so much more womanly,
in all things winning admiration, had made such wonderful advance,
that I seemed to have made none. I fancied, as I looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>), that
I slipped hopelessly back into the coarse and common boy again. O
the sense of distance and disparity that came upon me, and the
inaccessibility that came about her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>)!

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) gave me her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) hand. I stammered something about the pleasure I felt in
seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) again, and about my having looked forward to it, for a long,
long time.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you find her (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) much changed, Pip?''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Havisham</b></font>)</div>asked Miss Havisham, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>)
greedy look, and striking her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) stick upon a chair that stood between
them, as a sign to me to sit down there.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``When I came in, Miss Havisham, I thought there was nothing of Estella
in the face or figure; but now it all settles down so curiously into the
old--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What? You are not going to say into the old Estella?''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Havisham</b></font>)</div>Miss Havisham
interrupted. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) was proud and insulting, and you wanted to go away
from her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>). Don't you remember?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I said confusedly that that was long ago, and that I knew no better
then, and the like. Estella smiled with perfect composure, and said she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>)
had no doubt of my having been quite right, and of her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) having been very
disagreeable.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is he (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) changed?''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Havisham</b></font>)</div>Miss Havisham asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very much,''  (<font color='red'><b>Estella/Miss Estella/ESTELLA</b></font>)</div>said Estella, looking at me.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Less coarse and common?''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Havisham</b></font>)</div>said Miss Havisham, playing with Estella's
hair.

<p/>Estella laughed, and looked at the shoe in her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) hand, and laughed again,
and looked at me, and put the shoe down. She (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) treated me as a boy still,
but she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) lured me on.

<p/>We sat in the dreamy room among the old strange influences which had
so wrought upon me, and I learnt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) had but just come home from
France, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) was going to London. Proud and wilful as of old,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) had brought those qualities into such subjection to her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) beauty that
it was impossible and out of nature--or I thought so--to separate them
from her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) beauty. Truly it was impossible to dissociate her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) presence
from all those wretched hankerings after money and gentility that had
disturbed my boyhood,--from all those ill-regulated aspirations that had
first made me ashamed of home and Joe,--from all those visions that had
raised her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) face in the glowing fire, struck it out of the iron on the
anvil, extracted it from the darkness of night to look in at the wooden
window of the forge, and flit away. In a word, it was impossible for me
to separate her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>), in the past or in the present, from the innermost life
of my life.

<p/>It was settled that I should stay there all the rest of the day, and
return to the hotel at night, and to London to-morrow. When we had
conversed for a while, Miss Havisham sent us two out to walk in the
neglected garden: on our coming in by and by, she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) said, I should wheel
her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) about a little, as in times of yore.

<p/>So, Estella and I went out into the garden by the gate through which I
had strayed to my encounter with the pale young gentleman, now Herbert;
I, trembling in spirit and worshipping the very hem of her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) dress; she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>),
quite composed and most decidedly not worshipping the hem of mine. As we
drew near to the place of encounter, she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) stopped and said,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I must have been a singular little creature to hide and see that fight
that day; but I did, and I enjoyed it very much.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You rewarded me very much.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did I?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) replied, in an incidental and forgetful way. <div class="bookquote">``I remember I
entertained a great objection to your adversary, because I took it ill
that he (<font color='blue'><b>adversary</b></font>) should be brought here to pester me with his (<font color='blue'><b>adversary</b></font>) company.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>adversary</b></font>) and I are great friends now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you? I think I recollect though, that you read with his (<font color='blue'><b>adversary</b></font>) father?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I made the admission with reluctance, for it seemed to have a boyish
look, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) already treated me more than enough like a boy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Since your change of fortune and prospects, you have changed your
companions,''  (<font color='red'><b>Estella/Miss Estella/ESTELLA</b></font>)</div>said Estella.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Naturally,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And necessarily,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) added, in a haughty tone; <div class="bookquote">``what was fit company
for you once, would be quite unfit company for you now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>In my conscience, I doubt very much whether I had any lingering
intention left of going to see Joe; but if I had, this observation put
it to flight.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You had no idea of your impending good fortune, in those times?''  (<font color='red'><b>Estella/Miss Estella/ESTELLA</b></font>)</div>said
Estella, with a slight wave of her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) hand, signifying in the fighting
times.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not the least.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>The air of completeness and superiority with which she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) walked at my
side, and the air of youthfulness and submission with which I walked at
hers, made a contrast that I strongly felt. It would have rankled in me
more than it did, if I had not regarded myself as eliciting it by being
so set apart for her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) and assigned to her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>).

<p/>The garden was too overgrown and rank for walking in with ease, and
after we had made the round of it twice or thrice, we came out again
into the brewery yard. I showed her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) to a nicety where I had seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>)
walking on the casks, that first old day, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) said, with a cold and
careless look in that direction, <div class="bookquote">``Did I?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>I reminded her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) where she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) had
come out of the house and given me my meat and drink, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I
don't remember.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Not remember that you made me cry?''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I. <div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said
she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>), and shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) head and looked about her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>). I verily believe that
her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) not remembering and not minding in the least, made me cry again,
inwardly,--and that is the sharpest crying of all.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You must know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Estella/Miss Estella/ESTELLA</b></font>)</div>said Estella, condescending to me as a brilliant and
beautiful woman might, <div class="bookquote">``that I have no heart,--if that has anything to
do with my memory.''

 (<font color='red'><b>a woman</b></font>)</div><p/>I got through some jargon to the effect that I took the liberty of
doubting that. That I knew better. That there could be no such beauty
without it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! I have a heart to be stabbed in or shot in, I have no doubt,''  (<font color='red'><b>Estella/Miss Estella/ESTELLA</b></font>)</div>said
Estella, <div class="bookquote">``and of course if it ceased to beat I should cease
to be. But you know what I mean. I have no softness there,
no--sympathy--sentiment--nonsense.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Estella/Miss Estella/ESTELLA</b></font>)</div><p/>What was it that was borne in upon my mind when she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) stood still and
looked attentively at me? Anything that I had seen in Miss Havisham? No.
In some of her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) looks and gestures there was that tinge of resemblance
to Miss Havisham which may often be noticed to have been acquired by
children, from grown person with whom they have been much associated and
secluded, and which, when childhood is passed, will produce a remarkable
occasional likeness of expression between faces that are otherwise quite
different. And yet I could not trace this to Miss Havisham. I looked
again, and though she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) was still looking at me, the suggestion was gone.

<p/>What was it?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am serious,''  (<font color='red'><b>Estella/Miss Estella/ESTELLA</b></font>)</div>said Estella, not so much with a frown -LRB-for her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) brow was
smooth-RRB- as with a darkening of her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) face; <div class="bookquote">``if we are to be thrown much
together, you had better believe it at once. No!''  (<font color='red'><b>Estella/Miss Estella/ESTELLA</b></font>)</div>imperiously stopping
me as I opened my lips. <div class="bookquote">``I have not bestowed my tenderness anywhere. I
have never had any such thing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>In another moment we were in the brewery, so long disused, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>)
pointed to the high gallery where I had seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) going out on that same
first day, and told me she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) remembered to have been up there, and to have
seen me standing scared below. As my eyes followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) white hand, again
the same dim suggestion that I could not possibly grasp crossed me. My
involuntary start occasioned her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) to lay her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) hand upon my arm. Instantly
the ghost passed once more and was gone.

<p/>What was it?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is the matter?''  (<font color='red'><b>Estella/Miss Estella/ESTELLA</b></font>)</div>asked Estella. <div class="bookquote">``Are you scared again?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should be, if I believed what you said just now,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I replied, to turn
it off.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then you don't? Very well. It is said, at any rate. Miss Havisham will
soon be expecting you at your old post, though I think that might be
laid aside now, with other old belongings. Let us make one more round
of the garden, and then go in. Come! You shall not shed tears for my
cruelty to-day; you shall be my Page, and give me your shoulder.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) handsome dress had trailed upon the ground. She (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) held it in one hand
now, and with the other lightly touched my shoulder as we walked. We
walked round the ruined garden twice or thrice more, and it was all in
bloom for me. If the green and yellow growth of weed in the chinks of
the old wall had been the most precious flowers that ever blew, it could
not have been more cherished in my remembrance.

<p/>There was no discrepancy of years between us to remove her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) far from me;
we were of nearly the same age, though of course the age told for more
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) case than in mine; but the air of inaccessibility which her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>)
beauty and her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) manner gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>), tormented me in the midst of my delight,
and at the height of the assurance I felt that our patroness had chosen
us for one another. Wretched boy!

<p/>At last we went back into the house, and there I heard, with surprise,
that my guardian had come down to see Miss Havisham on business, and
would come back to dinner. The old wintry branches of chandeliers in
the room where the mouldering table was spread had been lighted while we
were out, and Miss Havisham was in her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) chair and waiting for me.

<p/>It was like pushing the chair itself back into the past, when we began
the old slow circuit round about the ashes of the bridal feast. But,
in the funereal room, with that figure of the grave fallen back in the
chair fixing its eyes upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>), Estella looked more bright and beautiful
than before, and I was under stronger enchantment.

<p/>The time so melted away, that our early dinner-hour drew close at hand,
and Estella left us to prepare herself. We had stopped near the centre
of the long table, and Miss Havisham, with one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) withered arms
stretched out of the chair, rested that clenched hand upon the yellow
cloth. As Estella looked back over her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) shoulder before going out at the
door, Miss Havisham kissed that hand to her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>), with a ravenous intensity
that was of its kind quite dreadful.

<p/>Then, Estella being gone and we two left alone, she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) turned to me, and
said in a whisper,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) beautiful, graceful, well-grown? Do you admire her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Everybody must who sees her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>), Miss Havisham.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) drew an arm round my neck, and drew my head close down to hers as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) sat in the chair. <div class="bookquote">``Love her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>), love her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>), love her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>)! How does she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) use
you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Before I could answer -LRB-if I could have answered so difficult a question
at all-RRB- she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) repeated, <div class="bookquote">``Love her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>), love her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>), love her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>)! If she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) favors
you, love her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>). If she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) wounds you, love her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>). If she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) tears your heart to
pieces,--and as it gets older and stronger it will tear deeper,--love
her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>), love her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>), love her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Never had I seen such passionate eagerness as was joined to her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>)
utterance of these words. I could feel the muscles of the thin arm round
my neck swell with the vehemence that possessed her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hear me, Pip! I adopted her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>), to be loved. I bred her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) and educated her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>),
to be loved. I developed her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) into what she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) is, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) might be loved.
Love her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) said the word often enough, and there could be no doubt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>)
meant to say it; but if the often repeated word had been hate instead of
love--despair--revenge--dire death--it could not have sounded from her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>)
lips more like a curse.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll tell you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>), in the same hurried passionate whisper, <div class="bookquote">``what
real love is. It is blind devotion, unquestioning self-humiliation,
utter submission, trust and belief against yourself and against the
whole world, giving up your whole heart and soul to the smiter--as I
did!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) came to that, and to a wild cry that followed that, I caught
her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) round the waist. For she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) rose up in the chair, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) shroud of a
dress, and struck at the air as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) would as soon have struck herself
against the wall and fallen dead.

<p/>All this passed in a few seconds. As I drew her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) down into her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) chair, I
was conscious of a scent that I knew, and turning, saw my guardian in
the room.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) always carried -LRB-I have not yet mentioned it, I think-RRB- a
pocket-handkerchief of rich silk and of imposing proportions, which was
of great value to him (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) profession. I have seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) so terrify a
client or a witness by ceremoniously unfolding this pocket-handkerchief
as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) were immediately going to blow his (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) nose, and then pausing,
as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) should not have time to do it before such client
or witness committed himself, that the self-committal has followed
directly, quite as a matter of course. When I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>client</b></font>) in the room he (<font color='blue'><b>client</b></font>) had
this expressive pocket-handkerchief in both hands, and was looking at
us. On meeting my eye, he (<font color='blue'><b>client</b></font>) said plainly, by a momentary and silent pause
in that attitude, <div class="bookquote">``Indeed? Singular!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and then put the handkerchief to
its right use with wonderful effect.

<p/>Miss Havisham had seen him (<font color='blue'><b>client</b></font>) as soon as I, and was -LRB-like everybody
else-RRB- afraid of him (<font color='blue'><b>client</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) made a strong attempt to compose herself, and
stammered that he (<font color='blue'><b>client</b></font>) was as punctual as ever.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``As punctual as ever,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>client</b></font>) repeated, coming up to us. <div class="bookquote">``-LRB-How do you do,
Pip? Shall I give you a ride, Miss Havisham? Once round?-RRB- And so you are
here, Pip?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I told him (<font color='blue'><b>client</b></font>) when I had arrived, and how Miss Havisham had wished me to
come and see Estella. To which he (<font color='blue'><b>client</b></font>) replied, <div class="bookquote">``Ah! Very fine young lady!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>client</b></font>) pushed Miss Havisham in her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) chair before him (<font color='blue'><b>client</b></font>), with one of his (<font color='blue'><b>client</b></font>)
large hands, and put the other in his (<font color='blue'><b>client</b></font>) trousers-pocket as if the pocket
were full of secrets.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, Pip! How often have you seen Miss Estella before?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>client</b></font>), when
he (<font color='blue'><b>client</b></font>) came to a stop.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How often?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! How many times? Ten thousand times?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! Certainly not so many.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Twice?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Jaggers,''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>interposed Miss Havisham, much to my relief, <div class="bookquote">``leave my Pip
alone, and go with him (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) to your dinner.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>client</b></font>) complied, and we groped our way down the dark stairs together. While
we were still on our way to those detached apartments across the paved
yard at the back, he (<font color='blue'><b>client</b></font>) asked me how often I had seen Miss Havisham eat
and drink; offering me a breadth of choice, as usual, between a hundred
times and once.

<p/>I considered, and said, <div class="bookquote">``Never.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And never will, Pip,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>client</b></font>) retorted, with a frowning smile. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) has
never allowed herself to be seen doing either, since she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) lived this
present life of hers. She (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) wanders about in the night, and then lays
hands on such food as she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) takes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pray, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, <div class="bookquote">``may I ask you a question?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You may,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>client</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``and I may decline to answer it. Put your question.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Estella's name. Is it Havisham or--?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I had nothing to add.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Or what?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>client</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it Havisham?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is Havisham.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>This brought us to the dinner-table, where she (<font color='blue'><b>our</b></font>) and Sarah Pocket awaited
us. Mr. Jaggers presided, Estella sat opposite to him (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>), I faced my
green and yellow friend. We dined very well, and were waited on by a
maid-servant whom I had never seen in all my comings and goings, but
who, for anything I know, had been in that mysterious house the whole
time. After dinner a bottle of choice old port was placed before my
guardian -LRB-he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) was evidently well acquainted with the vintage-RRB-, and the
two ladies left us.

<p/>Anything to equal the determined reticence of Mr. Jaggers under that
roof I never saw elsewhere, even in him (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) kept his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) very looks to
himself, and scarcely directed his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) eyes to Estella's face once during
dinner. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) spoke to him (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) listened, and in due course answered,
but never looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>), that I could see. On the other hand, she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) often
looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>), with interest and curiosity, if not distrust, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>)
face never showed the least consciousness. Throughout dinner he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) took
a dry delight in making Sarah Pocket greener and yellower, by often
referring in conversation with me to my expectations; but here,
again, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) showed no consciousness, and even made it appear that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>)
extorted--and even did extort, though I don't know how--those references
out of my innocent self.

<p/>And when he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) and I were left alone together, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) sat with an air upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>)
of general lying by in consequence of information he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) possessed, that
really was too much for me. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) cross-examined his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) very wine when he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) had
nothing else in hand. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) held it between himself and the candle, tasted
the port, rolled it in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) mouth, swallowed it, looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>)
glass again, smelt the port, tried it, drank it, filled again, and
cross-examined the glass again, until I was as nervous as if I had known
the wine to be telling him (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) something to my disadvantage. Three or four
times I feebly thought I would start conversation; but whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) saw
me going to ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) anything, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) looked at me with his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) glass in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>)
hand, and rolling his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) wine about in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) mouth, as if requesting me to
take notice that it was of no use, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) couldn't answer.

<p/>I think Miss Pocket was conscious that the sight of me involved her (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>)
in the danger of being goaded to madness, and perhaps tearing off her (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>)
cap,--which was a very hideous one, in the nature of a muslin mop,--and
strewing the ground with her (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) hair,--which assuredly had never grown
on her (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) head. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) did not appear when we afterwards went up to Miss
Havisham's room, and we four played at whist. In the interval, Miss
Havisham, in a fantastic way, had put some of the most beautiful jewels
from her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) dressing-table into Estella's hair, and about her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) bosom and
arms; and I saw even my guardian look at her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) from under his (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) thick
eyebrows, and raise them a little, when her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) loveliness was before him (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>),
with those rich flushes of glitter and color in it.

<p/>Of the manner and extent to which he (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) took our trumps into custody, and
came out with mean little cards at the ends of hands, before which the
glory of our Kings and Queens was utterly abased, I say nothing; nor, of
the feeling that I had, respecting his (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) looking upon us personally in the
light of three very obvious and poor riddles that he (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) had found out long
ago. What I suffered from, was the incompatibility between his (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) cold
presence and my feelings towards Estella. It was not that I knew I could
never bear to speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) about her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>), that I knew I could never bear to
hear him (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) creak his (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) boots at her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>), that I knew I could never bear to see
him (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) wash his (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) hands of her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>); it was, that my admiration should be within
a foot or two of him (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>),--it was, that my feelings should be in the same
place with him (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>),--that, was the agonizing circumstance.

<p/>We played until nine o’clock, and then it was arranged that when Estella
came to London I should be forewarned of her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) coming and should meet her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>)
at the coach; and then I took leave of her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>), and touched her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) and left
her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>).

<p/>My guardian lay at the Boar in the next room to mine. Far into the
night, Miss Havisham's words, <div class="bookquote">``Love her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>), love her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>), love her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Havisham</b></font>)</div>sounded in
my ears. I adapted them for my own repetition, and said to my pillow, <div class="bookquote">``I
love her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>), I love her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>), I love her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>hundreds of times. Then, a burst of
gratitude came upon me, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) should be destined for me, once the
blacksmith's boy. Then I thought if she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) were, as I feared, by no means
rapturously grateful for that destiny yet, when would she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) begin to be
interested in me? When should I awaken the heart within her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) that was
mute and sleeping now?

<p/>Ah me! I thought those were high and great emotions. But I never thought
there was anything low and small in my keeping away from Joe, because
I knew she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) would be contemptuous of him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>). It was but a day gone, and Joe
had brought the tears into my eyes; they had soon dried, God forgive me!
soon dried.




<p/>Chapter XXX

<p/>After well considering the matter while I was dressing at the Blue Boar
in the morning, I resolved to tell my guardian that I doubted Orlick's
being the right sort of man to fill a post of trust at Miss Havisham's.
<div class="bookquote">``Why of course he (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) is not the right sort of man, Pip,''  (<font color='red'><b>guardian man</b></font>)</div>said my guardian,
comfortably satisfied beforehand on the general head, <div class="bookquote">``because the man
who fills the post of trust never is the right sort of man.''  (<font color='red'><b>guardian man</b></font>)</div>It seemed
quite to put him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) into spirits to find that this particular post was
not exceptionally held by the right sort of man, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) listened in a
satisfied manner while I told him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) what knowledge I had of Orlick. <div class="bookquote">``Very
good, Pip,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) observed, when I had concluded, <div class="bookquote">``I'll go round presently,
and pay our friend off.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Rather alarmed by this summary action, I was
for a little delay, and even hinted that our friend himself might be
difficult to deal with. <div class="bookquote">``Oh no he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) won't,''  (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div>said my guardian, making his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)
pocket-handkerchief-point, with perfect confidence; <div class="bookquote">``I should like to
see him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) argue the question with me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div><p/>As we were going back together to London by the midday coach, and as I
breakfasted under such terrors of Pumblechook that I could scarcely hold
my cup, this gave me an opportunity of saying that I wanted a walk, and
that I would go on along the London road while Mr. Jaggers was occupied,
if he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) would let the coachman know that I would get into my place when
overtaken. I was thus enabled to fly from the Blue Boar immediately
after breakfast. By then making a loop of about a couple of miles into
the open country at the back of Pumblechook's premises, I got round into
the High Street again, a little beyond that pitfall, and felt myself in
comparative security.

<p/>It was interesting to be in the quiet old town once more, and it was not
disagreeable to be here and there suddenly recognized and stared after.
One or two of the tradespeople even darted out of their shops and went
a little way down the street before me, that they might turn, as if they
had forgotten something, and pass me face to face,--on which occasions I
don't know whether they or I made the worse pretence; they of not doing
it, or I of not seeing it. Still my position was a distinguished one,
and I was not at all dissatisfied with it, until Fate threw me in the
way of that unlimited miscreant, Trabb's boy.

<p/>Casting my eyes along the street at a certain point of my progress, I
beheld Trabb's boy approaching, lashing himself with an empty blue bag.
Deeming that a serene and unconscious contemplation of him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) would best
beseem me, and would be most likely to quell his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) evil mind, I advanced
with that expression of countenance, and was rather congratulating
myself on my success, when suddenly the knees of Trabb's boy smote
together, his (<font color='blue'><b>Trabb</b></font>) hair uprose, his (<font color='blue'><b>Trabb</b></font>) cap fell off, he (<font color='blue'><b>Trabb</b></font>) trembled violently in
every limb, staggered out into the road, and crying to the populace,
<div class="bookquote">``Hold me! I'm so frightened!''  (<font color='red'><b>the populace</b></font>)</div>feigned to be in a paroxysm of terror and
contrition, occasioned by the dignity of my appearance. As I passed him (<font color='blue'><b>Trabb</b></font>),
his (<font color='blue'><b>Trabb</b></font>) teeth loudly chattered in his (<font color='blue'><b>Trabb</b></font>) head, and with every mark of extreme
humiliation, he (<font color='blue'><b>Trabb</b></font>) prostrated himself in the dust.

<p/>This was a hard thing to bear, but this was nothing. I had not advanced
another two hundred yards when, to my inexpressible terror, amazement,
and indignation, I again beheld Trabb's boy approaching. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was coming
round a narrow corner. His (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) blue bag was slung over his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) shoulder, honest
industry beamed in his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) eyes, a determination to proceed to Trabb's with
cheerful briskness was indicated in his (<font color='blue'><b>Trabb</b></font>) gait. With a shock he (<font color='blue'><b>Trabb</b></font>) became
aware of me, and was severely visited as before; but this time his (<font color='blue'><b>Trabb</b></font>)
motion was rotatory, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Trabb</b></font>) staggered round and round me with knees
more afflicted, and with uplifted hands as if beseeching for mercy. His (<font color='blue'><b>Trabb</b></font>)
sufferings were hailed with the greatest joy by a knot of spectators,
and I felt utterly confounded.

<p/>I had not got as much further down the street as the post-office, when I
again beheld Trabb's boy shooting round by a back way. This time, he (<font color='blue'><b>Trabb</b></font>) was
entirely changed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Trabb</b></font>) wore the blue bag in the manner of my great-coat,
and was strutting along the pavement towards me on the opposite side of
the street, attended by a company of delighted young friends to whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Trabb</b></font>)
from time to time exclaimed, with a wave of his (<font color='blue'><b>Trabb</b></font>) hand, <div class="bookquote">``Don't know yah!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Words cannot state the amount of aggravation and injury wreaked upon
me by Trabb's boy, when passing abreast of me, he (<font color='blue'><b>Trabb</b></font>) pulled up his (<font color='blue'><b>Trabb</b></font>)
shirt-collar, twined his (<font color='blue'><b>Trabb</b></font>) side-hair, stuck an arm akimbo, and smirked
extravagantly by, wriggling his (<font color='blue'><b>Trabb</b></font>) elbows and body, and drawling to his (<font color='blue'><b>Trabb</b></font>)
attendants, <div class="bookquote">``Don't know yah, don't know yah, `pon my soul don't know
yah!''  (<font color='red'><b>attendants</b></font>)</div>The disgrace attendant on his (<font color='blue'><b>Trabb</b></font>) immediately afterwards taking
to crowing and pursuing me across the bridge with crows, as from an
exceedingly dejected fowl who had known me when I was a blacksmith,
culminated the disgrace with which I left the town, and was, so to
speak, ejected by it into the open country.

<p/>But unless I had taken the life of Trabb's boy on that occasion, I
really do not even now see what I could have done save endure. To
have struggled with him (<font color='blue'><b>Trabb</b></font>) in the street, or to have exacted any lower
recompense from him (<font color='blue'><b>Trabb</b></font>) than his (<font color='blue'><b>Trabb</b></font>) heart's best blood, would have been
futile and degrading. Moreover, he (<font color='blue'><b>Trabb</b></font>) was a boy whom no man could hurt; an
invulnerable and dodging serpent who, when chased into a corner, flew
out again between his (<font color='blue'><b>Trabb</b></font>) captor's legs, scornfully yelping. I wrote,
however, to Mr. Trabb by next day's post, to say that Mr. Pip must
decline to deal further with one who could so far forget what he (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) owed to
the best interests of society, as to employ a boy who excited Loathing
in every respectable mind.

<p/>The coach, with Mr. Jaggers inside, came up in due time, and I took my
box-seat again, and arrived in London safe,--but not sound, for my heart
was gone. As soon as I arrived, I sent a penitential codfish and barrel
of oysters to Joe -LRB-as reparation for not having gone myself-RRB-, and then
went on to Barnard's Inn.

<p/>I found Herbert dining on cold meat, and delighted to welcome me back.
Having despatched The Avenger to the coffee-house for an addition to the
dinner, I felt that I must open my breast that very evening to my friend
and chum. As confidence was out of the question with The Avenger in the
hall, which could merely be regarded in the light of an antechamber to
the keyhole, I sent him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) to the Play. A better proof of the severity
of my bondage to that taskmaster could scarcely be afforded, than
the degrading shifts to which I was constantly driven to find him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)
employment. So mean is extremity, that I sometimes sent him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) to Hyde Park
corner to see what o’clock it was.

<p/>Dinner done and we sitting with our feet upon the fender, I said to
Herbert, <div class="bookquote">``My dear Herbert, I have something very particular to tell
you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Herbert/Herbert Pocket</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear Handel,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) returned, <div class="bookquote">``I shall esteem and respect your
confidence.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It concerns myself, Herbert,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, <div class="bookquote">``and one other person.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Herbert crossed his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) feet, looked at the fire with his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) head on one side,
and having looked at it in vain for some time, looked at me because I
didn't go on.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Herbert,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, laying my hand upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) knee, <div class="bookquote">``I love--I
adore--Estella.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Instead of being transfixed, Herbert replied in an easy matter-of-course
way, <div class="bookquote">``Exactly. Well?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Herbert/Herbert Pocket</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, Herbert? Is that all you say? Well?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What next, I mean?''  (<font color='red'><b>Herbert/Herbert Pocket</b></font>)</div>said Herbert. <div class="bookquote">``Of course I know that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How do you know it?''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How do I know it, Handel? Why, from you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I never told you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Told me! You have never told me when you have got your hair cut, but I
have had senses to perceive it. You have always adored her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>), ever since
I have known you. You brought your adoration and your portmanteau here
together. Told me! Why, you have always told me all day long. When you
told me your own story, you told me plainly that you began adoring her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>)
the first time you saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>), when you were very young indeed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well, then,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, to whom this was a new and not unwelcome
light, <div class="bookquote">``I have never left off adoring her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>). And she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) has come back, a most
beautiful and most elegant creature. And I saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) yesterday. And if I
adored her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) before, I now doubly adore her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Lucky for you then, Handel,''  (<font color='red'><b>Herbert/Herbert Pocket</b></font>)</div>said Herbert, <div class="bookquote">``that you are picked out for
her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) and allotted to her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>). Without encroaching on forbidden ground, we
may venture to say that there can be no doubt between ourselves of
that fact. Have you any idea yet, of Estella's views on the adoration
question?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Herbert/Herbert Pocket</b></font>)</div><p/>I shook my head gloomily. <div class="bookquote">``Oh! She (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) is thousands of miles away, from me,''
 (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Patience, my dear Handel: time enough, time enough. But you have
something more to say?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am ashamed to say it,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I returned, <div class="bookquote">``and yet it's no worse to say it
than to think it. You call me a lucky fellow. Of course, I am. I was a
blacksmith's boy but yesterday; I am--what shall I say I am--to-day?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Say a good fellow, if you want a phrase,''  (<font color='red'><b>Herbert/Herbert Pocket</b></font>)</div>returned Herbert, smiling,
and clapping his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) hand on the back of mine--<div class="bookquote">``a good fellow, with
impetuosity and hesitation, boldness and diffidence, action and
dreaming, curiously mixed in him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Herbert/Herbert Pocket</b></font>)</div><p/>I stopped for a moment to consider whether there really was this mixture
in my character. On the whole, I by no means recognized the analysis,
but thought it not worth disputing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``When I ask what I am to call myself to-day, Herbert,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I went on, <div class="bookquote">``I
suggest what I have in my thoughts. You say I am lucky. I know I have
done nothing to raise myself in life, and that Fortune alone has raised
me; that is being very lucky. And yet, when I think of Estella--''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>-LRB-<div class="bookquote">``And when don't you, you know?''  (<font color='red'><b>Herbert/Herbert Pocket</b></font>)</div>Herbert threw in, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) eyes on the
fire; which I thought kind and sympathetic of him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>).-RRB-

<p/><div class="bookquote">``--Then, my dear Herbert, I cannot tell you how dependent and uncertain
I feel, and how exposed to hundreds of chances. Avoiding forbidden
ground, as you did just now, I may still say that on the constancy of
one person -LRB-naming no person-RRB- all my expectations depend. And at the
best, how indefinite and unsatisfactory, only to know so vaguely what
they are!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>In saying this, I relieved my mind of what had always been
there, more or less, though no doubt most since yesterday.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, Handel,''  (<font color='red'><b>Herbert/Herbert Pocket</b></font>)</div>Herbert replied, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) gay, hopeful way, <div class="bookquote">``it seems to me
that in the despondency of the tender passion, we are looking into our
gift-horse's mouth with a magnifying-glass. Likewise, it seems to me
that, concentrating our attention on the examination, we altogether
overlook one of the best points of the animal. Didn't you tell me that
your guardian, Mr. Jaggers, told you in the beginning, that you were
not endowed with expectations only? And even if he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) had not told you
so,--though that is a very large If, I grant,--could you believe that of
all men in London, Mr. Jaggers is the man to hold his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) present relations
towards you unless he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) were sure of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) ground?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Herbert/Herbert Pocket</b></font>)</div><p/>I said I could not deny that this was a strong point. I said it -LRB-people
often do so, in such cases-RRB- like a rather reluctant concession to truth
and justice;--as if I wanted to deny it!

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I should think it was a strong point,''  (<font color='red'><b>Herbert/Herbert Pocket</b></font>)</div>said Herbert, <div class="bookquote">``and I should
think you would be puzzled to imagine a stronger; as to the rest, you
must bide your guardian's time, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) must bide his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) client's time.
You'll be one-and-twenty before you know where you are, and then perhaps
you'll get some further enlightenment. At all events, you'll be nearer
getting it, for it must come at last.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Herbert/Herbert Pocket</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What a hopeful disposition you have!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, gratefully admiring his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>)
cheery ways.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I ought to have,''  (<font color='red'><b>Herbert/Herbert Pocket</b></font>)</div>said Herbert, ``for I have not much else. I must
acknowledge, by the by, that the good sense of what I have just said is
not my own, but my father's. The only remark I ever heard him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) make on
your story, was the final one, ``The thing is settled and done, or Mr.
Jaggers would not be in it.<div class="bookquote">'' And now before I say anything more about my
father, or my father's son, and repay confidence with confidence, I want
to make myself seriously disagreeable to you for a moment,--positively
repulsive.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jaggers/Jaggers/MR. JAGGERS</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You won't succeed,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``O yes I shall!''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``One, two, three, and now I am in for it.
Handel, my good fellow;'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--though he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) spoke in this light tone, he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) was
very much in earnest,--<div class="bookquote">``I have been thinking since we have been talking
with our feet on this fender, that Estella surely cannot be a condition
of your inheritance, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) was never referred to by your guardian. Am
I right in so understanding what you have told me, as that he (<font color='blue'><b>Handel</b></font>) never
referred to her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>), directly or indirectly, in any way? Never even hinted,
for instance, that your patron might have views as to your marriage
ultimately?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, Handel, I am quite free from the flavor of sour grapes, upon my
soul and honor! Not being bound to her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>), can you not detach yourself from
her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>)?--I told you I should be disagreeable.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I turned my head aside, for, with a rush and a sweep, like the old marsh
winds coming up from the sea, a feeling like that which had subdued
me on the morning when I left the forge, when the mists were solemnly
rising, and when I laid my hand upon the village finger-post, smote upon
my heart again. There was silence between us for a little while.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; but my dear Handel,''  (<font color='red'><b>Herbert/Herbert Pocket</b></font>)</div>Herbert went on, as if we had been talking,
instead of silent, <div class="bookquote">``its having been so strongly rooted in the breast of
a boy whom nature and circumstances made so romantic, renders it very
serious. Think of her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) bringing-up, and think of Miss Havisham. Think of
what she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) is herself -LRB-now I am repulsive and you abominate me-RRB-. This may
lead to miserable things.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Herbert/Herbert Pocket</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know it, Herbert,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, with my head still turned away, <div class="bookquote">``but I
can't help it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You can't detach yourself?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No. Impossible!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You can't try, Handel?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No. Impossible!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well!''  (<font color='red'><b>Herbert/Herbert Pocket</b></font>)</div>said Herbert, getting up with a lively shake as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) had
been asleep, and stirring the fire, <div class="bookquote">``now I'll endeavor to make myself
agreeable again!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>So he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) went round the room and shook the curtains out, put the chairs
in their places, tidied the books and so forth that were lying about,
looked into the hall, peeped into the letter-box, shut the door, and
came back to his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) chair by the fire: where he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) sat down, nursing his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) left
leg in both arms.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I was going to say a word or two, Handel, concerning my father and my
father's son. I am afraid it is scarcely necessary for my father's son
to remark that my father's establishment is not particularly brilliant
in its housekeeping.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There is always plenty, Herbert,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, to say something encouraging.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``O yes! and so the dustman says, I believe, with the strongest approval,
and so does the marine-store shop in the back street. Gravely, Handel,
for the subject is grave enough, you know how it is as well as I do. I
suppose there was a time once when my father had not given matters up;
but if ever there was, the time is gone. May I ask you if you have ever
had an opportunity of remarking, down in your part of the country,
that the children of not exactly suitable marriages are always most
particularly anxious to be married?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>This was such a singular question, that I asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) in return, <div class="bookquote">``Is it
so?''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Herbert/Herbert Pocket</b></font>)</div>said Herbert, <div class="bookquote">``that's what I want to know. Because it
is decidedly the case with us. My poor sister Charlotte, who was next me
and died before she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) was fourteen, was a striking example. Little Jane
is the same. In her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) desire to be matrimonially established, you
might suppose her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) to have passed her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) short existence in the perpetual
contemplation of domestic bliss. Little Alick in a frock has already
made arrangements for his (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) union with a suitable young person at Kew. And
indeed, I think we are all engaged, except the baby.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Herbert/Herbert Pocket</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then you are?''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said Herbert; <div class="bookquote">``but it's a secret.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Herbert/Herbert Pocket</b></font>)</div><p/>I assured him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) of my keeping the secret, and begged to be favored with
further particulars. He (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) had spoken so sensibly and feelingly of my
weakness that I wanted to know something about his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) strength.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``May I ask the name?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Name of Clara,''  (<font color='red'><b>Herbert/Herbert Pocket</b></font>)</div>said Herbert.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Live in London?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, perhaps I ought to mention,''  (<font color='red'><b>Herbert/Herbert Pocket</b></font>)</div>said Herbert, who had become
curiously crestfallen and meek, since we entered on the interesting
theme, <div class="bookquote">``that she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) is rather below my mother's nonsensical family notions.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) father had to do with the victualling of passenger-ships. I think he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
was a species of purser.''

 (<font color='red'><b>meek</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What is he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) now?''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)'s an invalid now,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>replied Herbert.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Living on--?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``On the first floor,''  (<font color='red'><b>Herbert/Herbert Pocket</b></font>)</div>said Herbert. Which was not at all what I meant,
for I had intended my question to apply to his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) means. <div class="bookquote">``I have never seen
him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), for he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) has always kept his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) room overhead, since I have known Clara.
But I have heard him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) constantly. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) makes tremendous rows,--roars, and
pegs at the floor with some frightful instrument.''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>In looking at me and
then laughing heartily, Herbert for the time recovered his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) usual lively
manner.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't you expect to see him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``O yes, I constantly expect to see him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>returned Herbert, <div class="bookquote">``because
I never hear him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), without expecting him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) to come tumbling through the
ceiling. But I don't know how long the rafters may hold.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Herbert/Herbert Pocket</b></font>)</div><p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) had once more laughed heartily, he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) became meek again, and told
me that the moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) began to realize Capital, it was his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) intention
to marry this young lady. He (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) added as a self-evident proposition,
engendering low spirits, <div class="bookquote">``But you can't marry, you know, while you're
looking about you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>spirits</b></font>)</div><p/>As we contemplated the fire, and as I thought what a difficult vision to
realize this same Capital sometimes was, I put my hands in my pockets.
A folded piece of paper in one of them attracting my attention, I opened
it and found it to be the play-bill I had received from Joe, relative
to the celebrated provincial amateur of Roscian renown. <div class="bookquote">``And bless my
heart,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I involuntarily added aloud, <div class="bookquote">``it's to-night!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>This changed the subject in an instant, and made us hurriedly resolve
to go to the play. So, when I had pledged myself to comfort and abet
Herbert in the affair of his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) heart by all practicable and impracticable
means, and when Herbert had told me that his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) affianced already knew me
by reputation and that I should be presented to her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>), and when we had
warmly shaken hands upon our mutual confidence, we blew out our candles,
made up our fire, locked our door, and issued forth in quest of Mr.
Wopsle and Denmark.




<p/>Chapter XXXI

<p/>On our arrival in Denmark, we found the king and queen of that country
elevated in two arm-chairs on a kitchen-table, holding a Court. The
whole of the Danish nobility were in attendance; consisting of a noble
boy in the wash-leather boots of a gigantic ancestor, a venerable Peer
with a dirty face who seemed to have risen from the people late in life,
and the Danish chivalry with a comb in its hair and a pair of white
silk legs, and presenting on the whole a feminine appearance. My gifted
townsman stood gloomily apart, with folded arms, and I could have wished
that his (<font color='blue'><b>Peer</b></font>) curls and forehead had been more probable.

<p/>Several curious little circumstances transpired as the action proceeded.
The late king of the country not only appeared to have been troubled
with a cough at the time of his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) decease, but to have taken it with him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>)
to the tomb, and to have brought it back. The royal phantom also carried
a ghostly manuscript round its truncheon, to which it had the appearance
of occasionally referring, and that too, with an air of anxiety and a
tendency to lose the place of reference which were suggestive of a state
of mortality. It was this, I conceive, which led to the Shade's being
advised by the gallery to <div class="bookquote">``turn over!'' (<font color='red'><b>the Shade</b></font>)</div>--a recommendation which it took
extremely ill. It was likewise to be noted of this majestic spirit, that
whereas it always appeared with an air of having been out a long time
and walked an immense distance, it perceptibly came from a closely
contiguous wall. This occasioned its terrors to be received derisively.
The Queen of Denmark, a very buxom lady, though no doubt historically
brazen, was considered by the public to have too much brass about her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>);
her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) chin being attached to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) diadem by a broad band of that metal -LRB-as
if she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had a gorgeous toothache-RRB-, her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) waist being encircled by another,
and each of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) arms by another, so that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was openly mentioned
as <div class="bookquote">``the kettle-drum.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>The noble boy in the ancestral boots was
inconsistent, representing himself, as it were in one breath, as an able
seaman, a strolling actor, a grave-digger, a clergyman, and a person
of the utmost importance at a Court fencing-match, on the authority
of whose practised eye and nice discrimination the finest strokes were
judged. This gradually led to a want of toleration for him (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>), and even--on
his (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) being detected in holy orders, and declining to perform the funeral
service--to the general indignation taking the form of nuts. Lastly,
Ophelia was a prey to such slow musical madness, that when, in course of
time, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) had taken off her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) white muslin scarf, folded it up, and buried
it, a sulky man who had been long cooling his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) impatient nose against an
iron bar in the front row of the gallery, growled, <div class="bookquote">``Now the baby's put
to bed let's have supper!''  (<font color='red'><b>a man</b></font>)</div>Which, to say the least of it, was out of
keeping.

<p/>Upon my unfortunate townsman all these incidents accumulated with
playful effect. Whenever that undecided Prince had to ask a question or
state a doubt, the public helped him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) out with it. As for example; on the
question whether `twas nobler in the mind to suffer, some roared yes,
and some no, and some inclining to both opinions said <div class="bookquote">``Toss up for
it;''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>and quite a Debating Society arose. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) asked what should such
fellows as he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) do crawling between earth and heaven, he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) was encouraged
with loud cries of <div class="bookquote">``Hear, hear!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) appeared with his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) stocking
disordered -LRB-its disorder expressed, according to usage, by one very neat
fold in the top, which I suppose to be always got up with a flat iron-RRB-,
a conversation took place in the gallery respecting the paleness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>)
leg, and whether it was occasioned by the turn the ghost had given him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>).
On his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) taking the recorders,--very like a little black flute that had
just been played in the orchestra and handed out at the door,--he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) was
called upon unanimously for Rule Britannia. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) recommended the
player not to saw the air thus, the sulky man said, <div class="bookquote">``And don't you do
it, neither; you're a deal worse than him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>And I grieve to add that
peals of laughter greeted Mr. Wopsle on every one of these occasions.

<p/>But his (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) greatest trials were in the churchyard, which had the appearance
of a primeval forest, with a kind of small ecclesiastical wash-house
on one side, and a turnpike gate on the other. Mr. Wopsle in a
comprehensive black cloak, being descried entering at the turnpike,
the gravedigger was admonished in a friendly way, <div class="bookquote">``Look out! Here's the
undertaker a coming, to see how you're a getting on with your work!''
 (<font color='red'><b>the gravedigger</b></font>)</div>I believe it is well known in a constitutional country that Mr. Wopsle
could not possibly have returned the skull, after moralizing over it,
without dusting his (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) fingers on a white napkin taken from his (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) breast;
but even that innocent and indispensable action did not pass without the
comment, <div class="bookquote">``Wai-ter!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wopsle/Wopsle</b></font>)</div>The arrival of the body for interment -LRB-in an empty
black box with the lid tumbling open-RRB-, was the signal for a general
joy, which was much enhanced by the discovery, among the bearers, of
an individual obnoxious to identification. The joy attended Mr. Wopsle
through his (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) struggle with Laertes on the brink of the orchestra and
the grave, and slackened no more until he (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) had tumbled the king off the
kitchen-table, and had died by inches from the ankles upward.

<p/>We had made some pale efforts in the beginning to applaud Mr. Wopsle;
but they were too hopeless to be persisted in. Therefore we had sat,
feeling keenly for him (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>), but laughing, nevertheless, from ear to ear. I
laughed in spite of myself all the time, the whole thing was so droll;
and yet I had a latent impression that there was something decidedly
fine in Mr. Wopsle's elocution,--not for old associations' sake, I am
afraid, but because it was very slow, very dreary, very uphill and
downhill, and very unlike any way in which any man in any natural
circumstances of life or death ever expressed himself about anything.
When the tragedy was over, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had been called for and hooted, I said
to Herbert, <div class="bookquote">``Let us go at once, or perhaps we shall meet him (<font color='blue'><b>undertaker</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Herbert/Herbert Pocket</b></font>)</div><p/>We made all the haste we could downstairs, but we were not quick enough
either. Standing at the door was a Jewish man with an unnatural heavy
smear of eyebrow, who caught my eyes as we advanced, and said, when we
came up with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>),--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Pip and friend?''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>Identity of Mr. Pip and friend confessed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Waldengarver,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the man, <div class="bookquote">``would be glad to have the honor.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Waldengarver?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I repeated--when Herbert murmured in my ear, <div class="bookquote">``Probably
Wopsle.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Herbert/Herbert Pocket</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh!''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I. <div class="bookquote">``Yes. Shall we follow you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A few steps, please.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>When we were in a side alley, he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) turned and
asked, <div class="bookquote">``How did you think he (<font color='blue'><b>Waldengarver</b></font>) looked?--I dressed him (<font color='blue'><b>Waldengarver</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>I don't know what he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) had looked like, except a funeral; with the
addition of a large Danish sun or star hanging round his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) neck by a
blue ribbon, that had given him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) the appearance of being insured in some
extraordinary Fire Office. But I said he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) had looked very nice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``When he (<font color='blue'><b>Waldengarver</b></font>) come to the grave,''  (<font color='red'><b>conductor</b></font>)</div>said our conductor, <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Waldengarver</b></font>) showed his (<font color='blue'><b>Waldengarver</b></font>) cloak
beautiful. But, judging from the wing, it looked to me that when he (<font color='blue'><b>Waldengarver</b></font>)
see the ghost in the queen's apartment, he (<font color='blue'><b>Waldengarver</b></font>) might have made more of his (<font color='blue'><b>Waldengarver</b></font>)
stockings.''

 (<font color='red'><b>conductor</b></font>)</div><p/>I modestly assented, and we all fell through a little dirty swing door,
into a sort of hot packing-case immediately behind it. Here Mr. Wopsle
was divesting himself of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) Danish garments, and here there was just
room for us to look at him (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) over one another's shoulders, by keeping the
packing-case door, or lid, wide open.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Gentlemen,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wopsle/Wopsle</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Wopsle, <div class="bookquote">``I am proud to see you. I hope, Mr. Pip,
you will excuse my sending round. I had the happiness to know you in
former times, and the Drama has ever had a claim which has ever been
acknowledged, on the noble and the affluent.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wopsle/Wopsle</b></font>)</div><p/>Meanwhile, Mr. Waldengarver, in a frightful perspiration, was trying to
get himself out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Waldengarver</b></font>) princely sables.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Skin the stockings off Mr. Waldengarver,''  (<font color='red'><b>the owner bust</b></font>)</div>said the owner of that
property, <div class="bookquote">``or you'll bust `em. Bust `em, and you'll bust five-and-thirty
shillings. Shakspeare never was complimented with a finer pair. Keep
quiet in your chair now, and leave `em to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the owner bust</b></font>)</div><p/>With that, he (<font color='blue'><b>Waldengarver</b></font>) went upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Waldengarver</b></font>) knees, and began to flay his (<font color='blue'><b>Waldengarver</b></font>) victim; who, on
the first stocking coming off, would certainly have fallen over backward
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Waldengarver</b></font>) chair, but for there being no room to fall anyhow.

<p/>I had been afraid until then to say a word about the play. But then, Mr.
Waldengarver looked up at us complacently, and said,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Gentlemen, how did it seem to you, to go, in front?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Waldengarver</b></font>)</div><p/>Herbert said from behind -LRB-at the same time poking me-RRB-, <div class="bookquote">``Capitally.''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>So I
said <div class="bookquote">``Capitally.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How did you like my reading of the character, gentlemen?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Waldengarver</b></font>)</div>said Mr.
Waldengarver, almost, if not quite, with patronage.

<p/>Herbert said from behind -LRB-again poking me-RRB-, <div class="bookquote">``Massive and concrete.''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>So I
said boldly, as if I had originated it, and must beg to insist upon it,
<div class="bookquote">``Massive and concrete.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am glad to have your approbation, gentlemen,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Waldengarver</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Waldengarver,
with an air of dignity, in spite of his (<font color='blue'><b>Waldengarver</b></font>) being ground against the wall at
the time, and holding on by the seat of the chair.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But I'll tell you one thing, Mr. Waldengarver,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the man who was on
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knees, ``in which you're out in your reading. Now mind! I don't care
who says contrairy; I tell you so. You're out in your reading of Hamlet
when you get your legs in profile. The last Hamlet as I dressed, made
the same mistakes in his (<font color='blue'><b>Waldengarver</b></font>) reading at rehearsal, till I got him (<font color='blue'><b>Waldengarver</b></font>) to put a
large red wafer on each of his (<font color='blue'><b>Waldengarver</b></font>) shins, and then at that rehearsal -LRB-which
was the last-RRB- I went in front, sir, to the back of the pit, and whenever
his (<font color='blue'><b>Waldengarver</b></font>) reading brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Waldengarver</b></font>) into profile, I called out ``I don't see no
wafers!<div class="bookquote">'' And at night his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) reading was lovely.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Waldengarver smiled at me, as much as to say <div class="bookquote">``a faithful
Dependent--I overlook his (<font color='blue'><b>Waldengarver</b></font>) folly;''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>and then said aloud, <div class="bookquote">``My view is a
little classic and thoughtful for them here; but they will improve, they
will improve.''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>Herbert and I said together, O, no doubt they would improve.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Did you observe, gentlemen,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Waldengarver</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Waldengarver, <div class="bookquote">``that there was a
man in the gallery who endeavored to cast derision on the service,--I
mean, the representation?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Waldengarver</b></font>)</div><p/>We basely replied that we rather thought we had noticed such a man. I
added, <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was drunk, no doubt.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``O dear no, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wopsle/Wopsle</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Wopsle, <div class="bookquote">``not drunk. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) employer would see to
that, sir. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) employer would not allow him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to be drunk.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wopsle/Wopsle</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You know his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) employer?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I.

<p/>Mr. Wopsle shut his (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) eyes, and opened them again; performing both
ceremonies very slowly. <div class="bookquote">``You must have observed, gentlemen,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>),
<div class="bookquote">``an ignorant and a blatant ass, with a rasping throat and a countenance
expressive of low malignity, who went through--I will not say
sustained--the rôle -LRB-if I may use a French expression-RRB- of Claudius, King
of Denmark. That is his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) employer, gentlemen. Such is the profession!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Without distinctly knowing whether I should have been more sorry for Mr.
Wopsle if he (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) had been in despair, I was so sorry for him (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) as it was,
that I took the opportunity of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) turning round to have his (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) braces
put on,--which jostled us out at the doorway,--to ask Herbert what he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>)
thought of having him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) home to supper? Herbert said he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) thought it would
be kind to do so; therefore I invited him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) went to Barnard's
with us, wrapped up to the eyes, and we did our best for him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) sat
until two o’clock in the morning, reviewing his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) success and developing
his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) plans. I forget in detail what they were, but I have a general
recollection that he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) was to begin with reviving the Drama, and to end
with crushing it; inasmuch as his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) decease would leave it utterly bereft
and without a chance or hope.

<p/>Miserably I went to bed after all, and miserably thought of Estella, and
miserably dreamed that my expectations were all cancelled, and that I
had to give my hand in marriage to Herbert's Clara, or play Hamlet to
Miss Havisham's Ghost, before twenty thousand people, without knowing
twenty words of it.




<p/>Chapter XXXII

<p/>One day when I was busy with my books and Mr. Pocket, I received a note
by the post, the mere outside of which threw me into a great flutter;
for, though I had never seen the handwriting in which it was addressed,
I divined whose hand it was. It had no set beginning, as Dear Mr. Pip,
or Dear Pip, or Dear Sir, or Dear Anything, but ran thus:--

<p/>``I am to come to London the day after to-morrow by the midday coach. I
believe it was settled you should meet me? At all events Miss Havisham
has that impression, and I write in obedience to it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) sends you her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>)
regard.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yours, ESTELLA.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>If there had been time, I should probably have ordered several suits
of clothes for this occasion; but as there was not, I was fain to be
content with those I had. My appetite vanished instantly, and I knew
no peace or rest until the day arrived. Not that its arrival brought
me either; for, then I was worse than ever, and began haunting the
coach-office in Wood Street, Cheapside, before the coach had left the
Blue Boar in our town. For all that I knew this perfectly well, I still
felt as if it were not safe to let the coach-office be out of my sight
longer than five minutes at a time; and in this condition of unreason I
had performed the first half-hour of a watch of four or five hours, when
Wemmick ran against me.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Halloa, Mr. Pip,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``how do you do? I should hardly have thought
this was your beat.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>I explained that I was waiting to meet somebody who was coming up by
coach, and I inquired after the Castle and the Aged.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Both flourishing thankye,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div>said Wemmick, <div class="bookquote">``and particularly the Aged.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>)'s in wonderful feather. He (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>)'ll be eighty-two next birthday. I have
a notion of firing eighty-two times, if the neighborhood shouldn't
complain, and that cannon of mine should prove equal to the pressure.
However, this is not London talk. Where do you think I am going to?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To the office?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) was tending in that direction.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Next thing to it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div>returned Wemmick, <div class="bookquote">``I am going to Newgate. We are in
a banker's-parcel case just at present, and I have been down the road
taking a squint at the scene of action, and thereupon must have a word
or two with our client.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did your client commit the robbery?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Bless your soul and body, no,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div>answered Wemmick, very drily. <div class="bookquote">``But he (<font color='blue'><b>client</b></font>)
is accused of it. So might you or I be. Either of us might be accused of
it, you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Only neither of us is,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I remarked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yah!''  (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div>said Wemmick, touching me on the breast with his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) forefinger;
<div class="bookquote">``you're a deep one, Mr. Pip! Would you like to have a look at Newgate?
Have you time to spare?''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>I had so much time to spare, that the proposal came as a relief,
notwithstanding its irreconcilability with my latent desire to keep my
eye on the coach-office. Muttering that I would make the inquiry whether
I had time to walk with him (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>), I went into the office, and ascertained
from the clerk with the nicest precision and much to the trying of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>)
temper, the earliest moment at which the coach could be expected,--which
I knew beforehand, quite as well as he (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>). I then rejoined Mr. Wemmick, and
affecting to consult my watch, and to be surprised by the information I
had received, accepted his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) offer.

<p/>We were at Newgate in a few minutes, and we passed through the lodge
where some fetters were hanging up on the bare walls among the prison
rules, into the interior of the jail. At that time jails were much
neglected, and the period of exaggerated reaction consequent on
all public wrongdoing--and which is always its heaviest and longest
punishment--was still far off. So, felons were not lodged and fed better
than soldiers -LRB-to say nothing of paupers-RRB-, and seldom set fire to their
prisons with the excusable object of improving the flavor of their soup.
It was visiting time when Wemmick took me in, and a potman was going his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>)
rounds with beer; and the prisoners, behind bars in yards, were buying
beer, and talking to friends; and a frowzy, ugly, disorderly, depressing
scene it was.

<p/>It struck me that Wemmick walked among the prisoners much as a gardener
might walk among his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) plants. This was first put into my head by his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>)
seeing a shoot that had come up in the night, and saying, <div class="bookquote">``What, Captain
Tom? Are you there? Ah, indeed!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>and also, <div class="bookquote">``Is that Black Bill behind
the cistern? Why I didn't look for you these two months; how do you find
yourself?''  (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div>Equally in his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) stopping at the bars and attending to
anxious whisperers,--always singly,--Wemmick with his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) post-office in
an immovable state, looked at them while in conference, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) were
taking particular notice of the advance they had made, since last
observed, towards coming out in full blow at their trial.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) was highly popular, and I found that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) took the familiar department
of Mr. Jaggers's business; though something of the state of Mr. Jaggers
hung about him (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) too, forbidding approach beyond certain limits. His (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>)
personal recognition of each successive client was comprised in a nod,
and in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) settling his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) hat a little easier on his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) head with both
hands, and then tightening the post-office, and putting his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) hands in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>)
pockets. In one or two instances there was a difficulty respecting the
raising of fees, and then Mr. Wemmick, backing as far as possible from
the insufficient money produced, said, <div class="bookquote">``it's no use, my boy. I'm only
a subordinate. I can't take it. Don't go on in that way with a
subordinate. If you are unable to make up your quantum, my boy, you had
better address yourself to a principal; there are plenty of principals
in the profession, you know, and what is not worth the while of one, may
be worth the while of another; that's my recommendation to you, speaking
as a subordinate. Don't try on useless measures. Why should you? Now,
who's next?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div><p/>Thus, we walked through Wemmick's greenhouse, until he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) turned to me and
said, <div class="bookquote">``Notice the man I shall shake hands with.''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>I should have done so,
without the preparation, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) had shaken hands with no one yet.

<p/>Almost as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) had spoken, a portly upright man -LRB-whom I can
see now, as I write-RRB- in a well-worn olive-colored frock-coat, with a
peculiar pallor overspreading the red in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) complexion, and eyes that
went wandering about when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) tried to fix them, came up to a corner
of the bars, and put his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hat--which had a greasy and fatty
surface like cold broth--with a half-serious and half-jocose military
salute.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Colonel, to you!''  (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div>said Wemmick; <div class="bookquote">``how are you, Colonel?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``All right, Mr. Wemmick.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Everything was done that could be done, but the evidence was too strong
for us, Colonel.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, it was too strong, sir,--but I don't care.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div>said Wemmick, coolly, <div class="bookquote">``you don't care.''  (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div>Then, turning to me,
<div class="bookquote">``Served His (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) Majesty this man. Was a soldier in the line and bought his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>)
discharge.''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>I said, <div class="bookquote">``Indeed?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>and the man's eyes looked at me, and then looked over
my head, and then looked all round me, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) drew his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) hand across
his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) lips and laughed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think I shall be out of this on Monday, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) said to Wemmick.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps,''  (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div>returned my friend, <div class="bookquote">``but there's no knowing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am glad to have the chance of bidding you good-bye, Mr. Wemmick,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said
the man, stretching out his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand between two bars.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thankye,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div>said Wemmick, shaking hands with him (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Same to you, Colonel.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If what I had upon me when taken had been real, Mr. Wemmick,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the
man, unwilling to let his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) hand go, <div class="bookquote">``I should have asked the favor of
your wearing another ring--in acknowledgment of your attentions.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll accept the will for the deed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div>said Wemmick. <div class="bookquote">``By the by; you were
quite a pigeon-fancier.''  (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div>The man looked up at the sky. <div class="bookquote">``I am told you
had a remarkable breed of tumblers. Could you commission any friend of
yours to bring me a pair, if you've no further use for `em?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It shall be done, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``All right,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div>said Wemmick, <div class="bookquote">``they shall be taken care of. Good afternoon,
Colonel. Good-bye!''  (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div>They shook hands again, and as we walked away Wemmick
said to me, <div class="bookquote">``A Coiner, a very good workman. The Recorder's report is
made to-day, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) is sure to be executed on Monday. Still you see, as
far as it goes, a pair of pigeons are portable property all the same.''
 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>With that, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) looked back, and nodded at this dead plant, and then cast
his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) eyes about him (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) in walking out of the yard, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) were considering
what other pot would go best in its place.

<p/>As we came out of the prison through the lodge, I found that the great
importance of my guardian was appreciated by the turnkeys, no less
than by those whom they held in charge. <div class="bookquote">``Well, Mr. Wemmick,''  (<font color='red'><b>the turnkey</b></font>)</div>said the
turnkey, who kept us between the two studded and spiked lodge gates,
and who carefully locked one before he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) unlocked the other, <div class="bookquote">``what's Mr.
Jaggers going to do with that water-side murder? Is he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) going to make it
manslaughter, or what's he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) going to make of it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why don't you ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div>returned Wemmick.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``O yes, I dare say!''  (<font color='red'><b>the turnkey</b></font>)</div>said the turnkey.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, that's the way with them here, Mr. Pip,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div>remarked Wemmick, turning
to me with his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) post-office elongated. <div class="bookquote">``They don't mind what they ask of
me, the subordinate; but you'll never catch `em asking any questions of
my principal.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is this young gentleman one of the `prentices or articled ones of your
office?''  (<font color='red'><b>the turnkey</b></font>)</div>asked the turnkey, with a grin at Mr. Wemmick's humor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) goes again, you see!''  (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div>cried Wemmick, <div class="bookquote">``I told you so! Asks
another question of the subordinate before his (<font color='blue'><b>subordinate</b></font>) first is dry! Well,
supposing Mr. Pip is one of them?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why then,''  (<font color='red'><b>the turnkey</b></font>)</div>said the turnkey, grinning again, <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>subordinate</b></font>) knows what Mr. Jaggers
is.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the turnkey</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yah!''  (<font color='red'><b>the turnkey</b></font>)</div>cried Wemmick, suddenly hitting out at the turnkey in a facetious
way, <div class="bookquote">``you're dumb as one of your own keys when you have to do with my
principal, you know you are. Let us out, you old fox, or I'll get him (<font color='blue'><b>fox</b></font>) to
bring an action against you for false imprisonment.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the turnkey</b></font>)</div><p/>The turnkey laughed, and gave us good day, and stood laughing at us over
the spikes of the wicket when we descended the steps into the street.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mind you, Mr. Pip,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div>said Wemmick, gravely in my ear, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) took my arm
to be more confidential; <div class="bookquote">``I don't know that Mr. Jaggers does a better
thing than the way in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) keeps himself so high. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>)'s always so
high. His (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) constant height is of a piece with his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) immense abilities. That
Colonel durst no more take leave of him (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>), than that turnkey durst ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>)
his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) intentions respecting a case. Then, between his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) height and them, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>)
slips in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) subordinate,--don't you see?--and so he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) has `em, soul and
body.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>I was very much impressed, and not for the first time, by my guardian's
subtlety. To confess the truth, I very heartily wished, and not for the
first time, that I had had some other guardian of minor abilities.

<p/>Mr. Wemmick and I parted at the office in Little Britain, where
suppliants for Mr. Jaggers's notice were lingering about as usual, and I
returned to my watch in the street of the coach-office, with some three
hours on hand. I consumed the whole time in thinking how strange it
was that I should be encompassed by all this taint of prison and crime;
that, in my childhood out on our lonely marshes on a winter evening, I
should have first encountered it; that, it should have reappeared on two
occasions, starting out like a stain that was faded but not gone; that,
it should in this new way pervade my fortune and advancement. While my
mind was thus engaged, I thought of the beautiful young Estella, proud
and refined, coming towards me, and I thought with absolute abhorrence
of the contrast between the jail and her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>). I wished that Wemmick had not
met me, or that I had not yielded to him (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) and gone with him (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>), so that,
of all days in the year on this day, I might not have had Newgate in
my breath and on my clothes. I beat the prison dust off my feet as I
sauntered to and fro, and I shook it out of my dress, and I exhaled
its air from my lungs. So contaminated did I feel, remembering who was
coming, that the coach came quickly after all, and I was not yet free
from the soiling consciousness of Mr. Wemmick's conservatory, when I saw
her (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) face at the coach window and her (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) hand waving to me.

<p/>What was the nameless shadow which again in that one instant had passed?




<p/>Chapter XXXIII

<p/>In her (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) furred travelling-dress, Estella seemed more delicately beautiful
than she (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) had ever seemed yet, even in my eyes. Her (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) manner was more
winning than she (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) had cared to let it be to me before, and I thought I
saw Miss Havisham's influence in the change.

<p/>We stood in the Inn Yard while she (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) pointed out her (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) luggage to me, and
when it was all collected I remembered--having forgotten everything but
herself in the meanwhile--that I knew nothing of her (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) destination.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am going to Richmond,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) told me. <div class="bookquote">``Our lesson is, that there are
two Richmonds, one in Surrey and one in Yorkshire, and that mine is the
Surrey Richmond. The distance is ten miles. I am to have a carriage, and
you are to take me. This is my purse, and you are to pay my charges out
of it. O, you must take the purse! We have no choice, you and I, but to
obey our instructions. We are not free to follow our own devices, you
and I.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>As she (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) looked at me in giving me the purse, I hoped there was an
inner meaning in her (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) words. She (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) said them slightingly, but not with
displeasure.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A carriage will have to be sent for, Estella. Will you rest here a
little?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I am to rest here a little, and I am to drink some tea, and you
are to take care of me the while.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) drew her (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) arm through mine, as if it must be done, and I requested a
waiter who had been staring at the coach like a man who had never seen
such a thing in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) life, to show us a private sitting-room. Upon that,
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pulled out a napkin, as if it were a magic clew without which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
couldn't find the way upstairs, and led us to the black hole of the
establishment, fitted up with a diminishing mirror -LRB-quite a superfluous
article, considering the hole's proportions-RRB-, an anchovy sauce-cruet,
and somebody's pattens. On my objecting to this retreat, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) took us into
another room with a dinner-table for thirty, and in the grate a scorched
leaf of a copy-book under a bushel of coal-dust. Having looked at this
extinct conflagration and shaken his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) took my order; which,
proving to be merely, <div class="bookquote">``Some tea for the lady,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>sent him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) out of the room
in a very low state of mind.

<p/>I was, and I am, sensible that the air of this chamber, in its strong
combination of stable with soup-stock, might have led one to infer that
the coaching department was not doing well, and that the enterprising
proprietor was boiling down the horses for the refreshment department.
Yet the room was all in all to me, Estella being in it. I thought that
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) I could have been happy there for life. -LRB-I was not at all happy
there at the time, observe, and I knew it well.-RRB-

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where are you going to, at Richmond?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked Estella.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am going to live,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``at a great expense, with a lady there,
who has the power--or says she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) has--of taking me about, and introducing
me, and showing people to me and showing me to people.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose you will be glad of variety and admiration?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I suppose so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) answered so carelessly, that I said, <div class="bookquote">``You speak of yourself as if
you were some one else.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Where did you learn how I speak of others? Come, come,''  (<font color='red'><b>Estella/Miss Estella/ESTELLA</b></font>)</div>said Estella,
smiling delightfully, <div class="bookquote">``you must not expect me to go to school to you; I
must talk in my own way. How do you thrive with Mr. Pocket?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Estella/Miss Estella/ESTELLA</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I live quite pleasantly there; at least--''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>It appeared to me that I was
losing a chance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``At least?''  (<font color='red'><b>Estella/Miss Estella/ESTELLA</b></font>)</div>repeated Estella.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``As pleasantly as I could anywhere, away from you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You silly boy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Estella/Miss Estella/ESTELLA</b></font>)</div>said Estella, quite composedly, <div class="bookquote">``how can you talk such
nonsense? Your friend Mr. Matthew, I believe, is superior to the rest of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) family?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Estella/Miss Estella/ESTELLA</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very superior indeed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) is nobody's enemy--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Estella/Miss Estella/ESTELLA</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't add but his (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) own,''  (<font color='red'><b>Estella/Miss Estella/ESTELLA</b></font>)</div>interposed Estella, <div class="bookquote">``for I hate that class of
man. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) really is disinterested, and above small jealousy and spite,
I have heard?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Estella/Miss Estella/ESTELLA</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sure I have every reason to say so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You have not every reason to say so of the rest of his (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) people,''  (<font color='red'><b>Estella/Miss Estella/ESTELLA</b></font>)</div>said
Estella, nodding at me with an expression of face that was at once
grave and rallying, <div class="bookquote">``for they beset Miss Havisham with reports and
insinuations to your disadvantage. They watch you, misrepresent you,
write letters about you -LRB-anonymous sometimes-RRB-, and you are the torment
and the occupation of their lives. You can scarcely realize to yourself
the hatred those people feel for you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They do me no harm, I hope?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Estella/Miss Estella/ESTELLA</b></font>)</div><p/>Instead of answering, Estella burst out laughing. This was very singular
to me, and I looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) in considerable perplexity. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) left
off--and she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) had not laughed languidly, but with real enjoyment--I said,
in my diffident way with her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>),--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope I may suppose that you would not be amused if they did me any
harm.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no you may be sure of that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Estella/Miss Estella/ESTELLA</b></font>)</div>said Estella. <div class="bookquote">``You may be certain that
I laugh because they fail. O, those people with Miss Havisham, and the
tortures they undergo!''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) laughed again, and even now when she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) had
told me why, her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) laughter was very singular to me, for I could not
doubt its being genuine, and yet it seemed too much for the occasion.
I thought there must really be something more here than I knew; she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) saw
the thought in my mind, and answered it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is not easy for even you.''  (<font color='red'><b>Estella/Miss Estella/ESTELLA</b></font>)</div>said Estella, <div class="bookquote">``to know what satisfaction
it gives me to see those people thwarted, or what an enjoyable sense of
the ridiculous I have when they are made ridiculous. For you were not
brought up in that strange house from a mere baby. I was. You had not
your little wits sharpened by their intriguing against you, suppressed
and defenceless, under the mask of sympathy and pity and what not that
is soft and soothing. I had. You did not gradually open your round
childish eyes wider and wider to the discovery of that impostor of a
woman who calculates her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) stores of peace of mind for when she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) wakes up
in the night. I did.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Estella/Miss Estella/ESTELLA</b></font>)</div><p/>It was no laughing matter with Estella now, nor was she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) summoning these
remembrances from any shallow place. I would not have been the cause of
that look of hers for all my expectations in a heap.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Two things I can tell you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Estella/Miss Estella/ESTELLA</b></font>)</div>said Estella. <div class="bookquote">``First, notwithstanding the
proverb that constant dropping will wear away a stone, you may set
your mind at rest that these people never will--never would, in hundred
years--impair your ground with Miss Havisham, in any particular, great
or small. Second, I am beholden to you as the cause of their being so
busy and so mean in vain, and there is my hand upon it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>As she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) gave it to me playfully,--for her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) darker mood had been but
Momentary,--I held it and put it to my lips. <div class="bookquote">``You ridiculous boy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Estella/Miss Estella/ESTELLA</b></font>)</div>said
Estella, <div class="bookquote">``will you never take warning? Or do you kiss my hand in the
same spirit in which I once let you kiss my cheek?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Estella/Miss Estella/ESTELLA</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What spirit was that?''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I must think a moment. A spirit of contempt for the fawners and
plotters.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If I say yes, may I kiss the cheek again?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You should have asked before you touched the hand. But, yes, if you
like.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I leaned down, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) calm face was like a statue's. <div class="bookquote">``Now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Estella/Miss Estella/ESTELLA</b></font>)</div>said
Estella, gliding away the instant I touched her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) cheek, <div class="bookquote">``you are to take
care that I have some tea, and you are to take me to Richmond.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) reverting to this tone as if our association were forced upon
us, and we were mere puppets, gave me pain; but everything in our
intercourse did give me pain. Whatever her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) tone with me happened to be,
I could put no trust in it, and build no hope on it; and yet I went on
against trust and against hope. Why repeat it a thousand times? So it
always was.

<p/>I rang for the tea, and the waiter, reappearing with his (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) magic clew,
brought in by degrees some fifty adjuncts to that refreshment, but of
tea not a glimpse. A teaboard, cups and saucers, plates, knives and
forks -LRB-including carvers-RRB-, spoons -LRB-various-RRB-, saltcellars, a meek little
muffin confined with the utmost precaution under a strong iron cover,
Moses in the bulrushes typified by a soft bit of butter in a quantity of
parsley, a pale loaf with a powdered head, two proof impressions of
the bars of the kitchen fireplace on triangular bits of bread, and
ultimately a fat family urn; which the waiter staggered in with,
expressing in his (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) countenance burden and suffering. After a prolonged
absence at this stage of the entertainment, he (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) at length came back with
a casket of precious appearance containing twigs. These I steeped in hot
water, and so from the whole of these appliances extracted one cup of I
don't know what for Estella.

<p/>The bill paid, and the waiter remembered, and the ostler not forgotten,
and the chambermaid taken into consideration,--in a word, the whole
house bribed into a state of contempt and animosity, and Estella's purse
much lightened,--we got into our post-coach and drove away. Turning into
Cheapside and rattling up Newgate Street, we were soon under the walls
of which I was so ashamed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What place is that?''  (<font color='red'><b>Estella/Miss Estella/ESTELLA</b></font>)</div>Estella asked me.

<p/>I made a foolish pretence of not at first recognizing it, and then
told her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>). As she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) looked at it, and drew in her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) head again,
murmuring, <div class="bookquote">``Wretches!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>I would not have confessed to my visit for any
consideration.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Jaggers,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, by way of putting it neatly on somebody else,
<div class="bookquote">``has the reputation of being more in the secrets of that dismal place
than any man in London.''

 (<font color='red'><b>somebody</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is more in the secrets of every place, I think,''  (<font color='red'><b>Estella/Miss Estella/ESTELLA</b></font>)</div>said Estella, in a
low voice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You have been accustomed to see him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) often, I suppose?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have been accustomed to see him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) at uncertain intervals, ever since
I can remember. But I know him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) no better now, than I did before I could
speak plainly. What is your own experience of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)? Do you advance with
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Once habituated to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) distrustful manner,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, <div class="bookquote">``I have done very
well.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you intimate?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have dined with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) private house.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I fancy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Estella/Miss Estella/ESTELLA</b></font>)</div>said Estella, shrinking <div class="bookquote">``that must be a curious place.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Estella/Miss Estella/ESTELLA</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is a curious place.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I should have been chary of discussing my guardian too freely even with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>); but I should have gone on with the subject so far as to describe
the dinner in Gerrard Street, if we had not then come into a sudden
glare of gas. It seemed, while it lasted, to be all alight and alive
with that inexplicable feeling I had had before; and when we were out of
it, I was as much dazed for a few moments as if I had been in lightning.

<p/>So we fell into other talk, and it was principally about the way by
which we were travelling, and about what parts of London lay on this
side of it, and what on that. The great city was almost new to her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)
told me, for she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) had never left Miss Havisham's neighborhood until she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)
had gone to France, and she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) had merely passed through London then in
going and returning. I asked her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) if my guardian had any charge of her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)
while she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) remained here? To that she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) emphatically said <div class="bookquote">``God forbid!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and
no more.

<p/>It was impossible for me to avoid seeing that she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) cared to attract me;
that she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) made herself winning, and would have won me even if the task
had needed pains. Yet this made me none the happier, for even if she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) had
not taken that tone of our being disposed of by others, I should have
felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) held my heart in her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) hand because she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) wilfully chose to do
it, and not because it would have wrung any tenderness in her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) to crush
it and throw it away.

<p/>When we passed through Hammersmith, I showed her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) where Mr. Matthew
Pocket lived, and said it was no great way from Richmond, and that I
hoped I should see her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) sometimes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``O yes, you are to see me; you are to come when you think proper; you
are to be mentioned to the family; indeed you are already mentioned.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I inquired was it a large household she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) was going to be a member of?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No; there are only two; mother and daughter. The mother is a lady of
some station, though not averse to increasing her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) income.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wonder Miss Havisham could part with you again so soon.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is a part of Miss Havisham's plans for me, Pip,''  (<font color='red'><b>Estella/Miss Estella/ESTELLA</b></font>)</div>said Estella, with
a sigh, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) were tired; <div class="bookquote">``I am to write to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) constantly and see
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) regularly and report how I go on,--I and the jewels,--for they are
nearly all mine now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>It was the first time she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) had ever called me by my name. Of course she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>)
did so purposely, and knew that I should treasure it up.

<p/>We came to Richmond all too soon, and our destination there was a house
by the green,--a staid old house, where hoops and powder and patches,
embroidered coats, rolled stockings, ruffles and swords, had had their
court days many a time. Some ancient trees before the house were still
cut into fashions as formal and unnatural as the hoops and wigs and
stiff skirts; but their own allotted places in the great procession of
the dead were not far off, and they would soon drop into them and go the
silent way of the rest.

<p/>A bell with an old voice--which I dare say in its time had often said
to the house, Here is the green farthingale, Here is the diamond-hilted
sword, Here are the shoes with red heels and the blue solitaire--sounded
gravely in the moonlight, and two cherry-colored maids came fluttering
out to receive Estella. The doorway soon absorbed her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) boxes, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>)
gave me her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) hand and a smile, and said good night, and was absorbed
likewise. And still I stood looking at the house, thinking how happy I
should be if I lived there with her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>), and knowing that I never was happy
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>), but always miserable.

<p/>I got into the carriage to be taken back to Hammersmith, and I got in
with a bad heart-ache, and I got out with a worse heart-ache. At our
own door, I found little Jane Pocket coming home from a little party
escorted by her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) little lover; and I envied her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) little lover, in spite of
his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) being subject to Flopson.

<p/>Mr. Pocket was out lecturing; for, he (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) was a most delightful lecturer on
domestic economy, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) treatises on the management of children and
servants were considered the very best text-books on those themes. But
Mrs. Pocket was at home, and was in a little difficulty, on account of
the baby's having been accommodated with a needle-case to keep him (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) quiet
during the unaccountable absence -LRB-with a relative in the Foot Guards-RRB-
of Millers. And more needles were missing than it could be regarded
as quite wholesome for a patient of such tender years either to apply
externally or to take as a tonic.

<p/>Mr. Pocket being justly celebrated for giving most excellent practical
advice, and for having a clear and sound perception of things and a
highly judicious mind, I had some notion in my heart-ache of begging him (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>)
to accept my confidence. But happening to look up at Mrs. Pocket as she (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>)
sat reading her (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) book of dignities after prescribing Bed as a sovereign
remedy for baby, I thought--Well--No, I wouldn't.




<p/>Chapter XXXIV

<p/>As I had grown accustomed to my expectations, I had insensibly begun to
notice their effect upon myself and those around me. Their influence on
my own character I disguised from my recognition as much as possible,
but I knew very well that it was not all good. I lived in a state of
chronic uneasiness respecting my behavior to Joe. My conscience was not
by any means comfortable about Biddy. When I woke up in the night,--like
Camilla,--I used to think, with a weariness on my spirits, that I should
have been happier and better if I had never seen Miss Havisham's face,
and had risen to manhood content to be partners with Joe in the honest
old forge. Many a time of an evening, when I sat alone looking at the
fire, I thought, after all there was no fire like the forge fire and the
kitchen fire at home.

<p/>Yet Estella was so inseparable from all my restlessness and disquiet of
mind, that I really fell into confusion as to the limits of my own part
in its production. That is to say, supposing I had had no expectations,
and yet had had Estella to think of, I could not make out to my
satisfaction that I should have done much better. Now, concerning the
influence of my position on others, I was in no such difficulty, and so
I perceived--though dimly enough perhaps--that it was not beneficial
to anybody, and, above all, that it was not beneficial to Herbert.
My lavish habits led his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) easy nature into expenses that he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) could not
afford, corrupted the simplicity of his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) life, and disturbed his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) peace
with anxieties and regrets. I was not at all remorseful for having
unwittingly set those other branches of the Pocket family to the poor
arts they practised; because such littlenesses were their natural
bent, and would have been evoked by anybody else, if I had left them
slumbering. But Herbert's was a very different case, and it often caused
me a twinge to think that I had done him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) evil service in crowding his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>)
sparely furnished chambers with incongruous upholstery work, and placing
the Canary-breasted Avenger at his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) disposal.

<p/>So now, as an infallible way of making little ease great ease, I began
to contract a quantity of debt. I could hardly begin but Herbert
must begin too, so he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) soon followed. At Startop's suggestion, we put
ourselves down for election into a club called The Finches of the Grove:
the object of which institution I have never divined, if it were not
that the members should dine expensively once a fortnight, to quarrel
among themselves as much as possible after dinner, and to cause six
waiters to get drunk on the stairs. I know that these gratifying social
ends were so invariably accomplished, that Herbert and I understood
nothing else to be referred to in the first standing toast of the
society: which ran <div class="bookquote">``Gentlemen, may the present promotion of good feeling
ever reign predominant among the Finches of the Grove.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>The Finches spent their money foolishly -LRB-the Hotel we dined at was
in Covent Garden-RRB-, and the first Finch I saw when I had the honor of
joining the Grove was Bentley Drummle, at that time floundering about
town in a cab of his (<font color='blue'><b>Finch</b></font>) own, and doing a great deal of damage to the posts
at the street corners. Occasionally, he (<font color='blue'><b>Finch</b></font>) shot himself out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Finch</b></font>) equipage
headforemost over the apron; and I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Finch</b></font>) on one occasion deliver
himself at the door of the Grove in this unintentional way--like coals.
But here I anticipate a little, for I was not a Finch, and could not be,
according to the sacred laws of the society, until I came of age.

<p/>In my confidence in my own resources, I would willingly have taken
Herbert's expenses on myself; but Herbert was proud, and I could make
no such proposal to him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>). So he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) got into difficulties in every direction,
and continued to look about him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>). When we gradually fell into keeping
late hours and late company, I noticed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) looked about him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) with a
desponding eye at breakfast-time; that he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) began to look about him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) more
hopefully about mid-day; that he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) drooped when he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) came into dinner;
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) seemed to descry Capital in the distance, rather clearly, after
dinner; that he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) all but realized Capital towards midnight; and that at
about two o’clock in the morning, he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) became so deeply despondent again
as to talk of buying a rifle and going to America, with a general
purpose of compelling buffaloes to make his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) fortune.

<p/>I was usually at Hammersmith about half the week, and when I was at
Hammersmith I haunted Richmond, whereof separately by and by. Herbert
would often come to Hammersmith when I was there, and I think at those
seasons his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) father would occasionally have some passing perception that
the opening he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) was looking for, had not appeared yet. But in the general
tumbling up of the family, his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) tumbling out in life somewhere, was
a thing to transact itself somehow. In the meantime Mr. Pocket grew
grayer, and tried oftener to lift himself out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) perplexities by the
hair. While Mrs. Pocket tripped up the family with her (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) footstool, read
her (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) book of dignities, lost her (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) pocket-handkerchief, told us about her (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>)
grandpapa, and taught the young idea how to shoot, by shooting it into
bed whenever it attracted her (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) notice.

<p/>As I am now generalizing a period of my life with the object of clearing
my way before me, I can scarcely do so better than by at once completing
the description of our usual manners and customs at Barnard's Inn.

<p/>We spent as much money as we could, and got as little for it as people
could make up their minds to give us. We were always more or less
miserable, and most of our acquaintance were in the same condition.
There was a gay fiction among us that we were constantly enjoying
ourselves, and a skeleton truth that we never did. To the best of my
belief, our case was in the last aspect a rather common one.

<p/>Every morning, with an air ever new, Herbert went into the City to look
about him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>). I often paid him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) a visit in the dark back-room in which
he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) consorted with an ink-jar, a hat-peg, a coal-box, a string-box, an
almanac, a desk and stool, and a ruler; and I do not remember that I
ever saw him (<font color='blue'><b>ruler</b></font>) do anything else but look about him (<font color='blue'><b>ruler</b></font>). If we all did what
we undertake to do, as faithfully as Herbert did, we might live in a
Republic of the Virtues. He (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) had nothing else to do, poor fellow, except
at a certain hour of every afternoon to <div class="bookquote">``go to Lloyd's'' (<font color='red'><b>fellow</b></font>)</div>--in observance
of a ceremony of seeing his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) principal, I think. He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) never did anything
else in connection with Lloyd's that I could find out, except come back
again. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Lloyd</b></font>) felt his (<font color='blue'><b>Lloyd</b></font>) case unusually serious, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lloyd</b></font>) positively
must find an opening, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lloyd</b></font>) would go on `Change at a busy time, and walk in
and out, in a kind of gloomy country dance figure, among the assembled
magnates. <div class="bookquote">``For,''  (<font color='red'><b>Herbert/Herbert Pocket</b></font>)</div>says Herbert to me, coming home to dinner on one
of those special occasions, <div class="bookquote">``I find the truth to be, Handel, that an
opening won't come to one, but one must go to it,--so I have been.''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>If we had been less attached to one another, I think we must have hated
one another regularly every morning. I detested the chambers beyond
expression at that period of repentance, and could not endure the
sight of the Avenger's livery; which had a more expensive and a
less remunerative appearance then than at any other time in the
four-and-twenty hours. As we got more and more into debt, breakfast
became a hollower and hollower form, and, being on one occasion at
breakfast-time threatened -LRB-by letter-RRB- with legal proceedings, <div class="bookquote">``not
unwholly unconnected,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>as my local paper might put it, <div class="bookquote">``with jewelery,''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I went so far as to seize the Avenger by his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) blue collar and shake
him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) off his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) feet,--so that he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) was actually in the air, like a booted
Cupid,--for presuming to suppose that we wanted a roll.

<p/>At certain times--meaning at uncertain times, for they depended on our
humor--I would say to Herbert, as if it were a remarkable discovery,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear Herbert, we are getting on badly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Herbert/Herbert Pocket</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear Handel,''  (<font color='red'><b>Herbert/Herbert Pocket</b></font>)</div>Herbert would say to me, in all sincerity, <div class="bookquote">``if you will
believe me, those very words were on my lips, by a strange coincidence.''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then, Herbert,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I would respond, <div class="bookquote">``let us look into our affairs.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>We always derived profound satisfaction from making an appointment for
this purpose. I always thought this was business, this was the way to
confront the thing, this was the way to take the foe by the throat. And
I know Herbert thought so too.

<p/>We ordered something rather special for dinner, with a bottle of
something similarly out of the common way, in order that our minds might
be fortified for the occasion, and we might come well up to the mark.
Dinner over, we produced a bundle of pens, a copious supply of ink, and
a goodly show of writing and blotting paper. For there was something
very comfortable in having plenty of stationery.

<p/>I would then take a sheet of paper, and write across the top of it, in a
neat hand, the heading, <div class="bookquote">``Memorandum of Pip's debts'' (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>; with Barnard's Inn
and the date very carefully added. Herbert would also take a sheet of
paper, and write across it with similar formalities, <div class="bookquote">``Memorandum of
Herbert's debts.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Herbert/Herbert Pocket</b></font>)</div><p/>Each of us would then refer to a confused heap of papers at his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) side,
which had been thrown into drawers, worn into holes in pockets, half
burnt in lighting candles, stuck for weeks into the looking-glass, and
otherwise damaged. The sound of our pens going refreshed us exceedingly,
insomuch that I sometimes found it difficult to distinguish between this
edifying business proceeding and actually paying the money. In point of
meritorious character, the two things seemed about equal.

<p/>When we had written a little while, I would ask Herbert how he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) got on?
Herbert probably would have been scratching his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) head in a most rueful
manner at the sight of his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) accumulating figures.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They are mounting up, Handel,''  (<font color='red'><b>Herbert/Herbert Pocket</b></font>)</div>Herbert would say; <div class="bookquote">``upon my life, they
are mounting up.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Herbert/Herbert Pocket</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Be firm, Herbert,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I would retort, plying my own pen with great
assiduity. <div class="bookquote">``Look the thing in the face. Look into your affairs. Stare
them out of countenance.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So I would, Handel, only they are staring me out of countenance.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Herbert/Herbert Pocket</b></font>)</div><p/>However, my determined manner would have its effect, and Herbert would
fall to work again. After a time he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) would give up once more, on the plea
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) had not got Cobbs's bill, or Lobbs's, or Nobbs's, as the case
might be.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then, Herbert, estimate; estimate it in round numbers, and put it
down.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What a fellow of resource you are!''  (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div>my friend would reply, with
admiration. <div class="bookquote">``Really your business powers are very remarkable.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I thought so too. I established with myself, on these occasions,
the reputation of a first-rate man of business,--prompt, decisive,
energetic, clear, cool-headed. When I had got all my responsibilities
down upon my list, I compared each with the bill, and ticked it off. My
self-approval when I ticked an entry was quite a luxurious sensation.
When I had no more ticks to make, I folded all my bills up uniformly,
docketed each on the back, and tied the whole into a symmetrical
bundle. Then I did the same for Herbert -LRB-who modestly said he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) had not my
administrative genius-RRB-, and felt that I had brought his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) affairs into a
focus for him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>).

<p/>My business habits had one other bright feature, which I called <div class="bookquote">``leaving
a Margin.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>For example; supposing Herbert's debts to be one hundred and
sixty-four pounds four-and-twopence, I would say, <div class="bookquote">``Leave a margin, and
put them down at two hundred.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Or, supposing my own to be four times as
much, I would leave a margin, and put them down at seven hundred. I had
the highest opinion of the wisdom of this same Margin, but I am bound
to acknowledge that on looking back, I deem it to have been an expensive
device. For, we always ran into new debt immediately, to the full extent
of the margin, and sometimes, in the sense of freedom and solvency it
imparted, got pretty far on into another margin.

<p/>But there was a calm, a rest, a virtuous hush, consequent on these
examinations of our affairs that gave me, for the time, an admirable
opinion of myself. Soothed by my exertions, my method, and Herbert's
compliments, I would sit with his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) symmetrical bundle and my own on the
table before me among the stationary, and feel like a Bank of some sort,
rather than a private individual.

<p/>We shut our outer door on these solemn occasions, in order that we might
not be interrupted. I had fallen into my serene state one evening, when
we heard a letter dropped through the slit in the said door, and fall on
the ground. <div class="bookquote">``It's for you, Handel,''  (<font color='red'><b>Herbert/Herbert Pocket</b></font>)</div>said Herbert, going out and coming
back with it, <div class="bookquote">``and I hope there is nothing the matter.''  (<font color='red'><b>Herbert/Herbert Pocket</b></font>)</div>This was in
allusion to its heavy black seal and border.

<p/>The letter was signed Trabb & Co., and its contents were simply, that
I was an honored sir, and that they begged to inform me that Mrs. J.
Gargery had departed this life on Monday last at twenty minutes past six
in the evening, and that my attendance was requested at the interment on
Monday next at three o’clock in the afternoon.




<p/>Chapter XXXV

<p/>It was the first time that a grave had opened in my road of life, and
the gap it made in the smooth ground was wonderful. The figure of my
sister in her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) chair by the kitchen fire, haunted me night and day. That
the place could possibly be, without her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>), was something my mind seemed
unable to compass; and whereas she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) had seldom or never been in my
thoughts of late, I had now the strangest ideas that she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) was coming
towards me in the street, or that she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) would presently knock at the door.
In my rooms too, with which she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) had never been at all associated, there
was at once the blankness of death and a perpetual suggestion of the
sound of her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) voice or the turn of her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) face or figure, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) were
still alive and had been often there.

<p/>Whatever my fortunes might have been, I could scarcely have recalled my
sister with much tenderness. But I suppose there is a shock of regret
which may exist without much tenderness. Under its influence -LRB-and
perhaps to make up for the want of the softer feeling-RRB- I was seized with
a violent indignation against the assailant from whom she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) had suffered
so much; and I felt that on sufficient proof I could have revengefully
pursued Orlick, or any one else, to the last extremity.

<p/>Having written to Joe, to offer him (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) consolation, and to assure him (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>)
that I would come to the funeral, I passed the intermediate days in
the curious state of mind I have glanced at. I went down early in the
morning, and alighted at the Blue Boar in good time to walk over to the
forge.

<p/>It was fine summer weather again, and, as I walked along, the times
when I was a little helpless creature, and my sister did not spare me,
vividly returned. But they returned with a gentle tone upon them that
softened even the edge of Tickler. For now, the very breath of the beans
and clover whispered to my heart that the day must come when it would
be well for my memory that others walking in the sunshine should be
softened as they thought of me.

<p/>At last I came within sight of the house, and saw that Trabb and Co. had
put in a funereal execution and taken possession. Two dismally absurd
persons, each ostentatiously exhibiting a crutch done up in a black
bandage,--as if that instrument could possibly communicate any comfort
to anybody,--were posted at the front door; and in one of them I
recognized a postboy discharged from the Boar for turning a young couple
into a sawpit on their bridal morning, in consequence of intoxication
rendering it necessary for him (<font color='blue'><b>couple</b></font>) to ride his (<font color='blue'><b>couple</b></font>) horse clasped round the neck
with both arms. All the children of the village, and most of the women,
were admiring these sable warders and the closed windows of the house
and forge; and as I came up, one of the two warders -LRB-the postboy-RRB-
knocked at the door,--implying that I was far too much exhausted by
grief to have strength remaining to knock for myself.

<p/>Another sable warder -LRB-a carpenter, who had once eaten two geese for a
wager-RRB- opened the door, and showed me into the best parlor. Here, Mr.
Trabb had taken unto himself the best table, and had got all the leaves
up, and was holding a kind of black Bazaar, with the aid of a quantity
of black pins. At the moment of my arrival, he (<font color='blue'><b>Trabb</b></font>) had just finished putting
somebody's hat into black long-clothes, like an African baby; so he (<font color='blue'><b>Trabb</b></font>) held
out his (<font color='blue'><b>Trabb</b></font>) hand for mine. But I, misled by the action, and confused by the
occasion, shook hands with him (<font color='blue'><b>Trabb</b></font>) with every testimony of warm affection.

<p/>Poor dear Joe, entangled in a little black cloak tied in a large bow
under his (<font color='blue'><b>Trabb</b></font>) chin, was seated apart at the upper end of the room; where,
as chief mourner, he (<font color='blue'><b>mourner</b></font>) had evidently been stationed by Trabb. When I bent
down and said to him (<font color='blue'><b>mourner</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``Dear Joe, how are you?''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>mourner</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Pip, old chap,
you knowed her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) when she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) were a fine figure of a--''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and clasped my hand
and said no more.

<p/>Biddy, looking very neat and modest in her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) black dress, went quietly
here and there, and was very helpful. When I had spoken to Biddy, as
I thought it not a time for talking I went and sat down near Joe, and
there began to wonder in what part of the house it--she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>)--my sister--was.
The air of the parlor being faint with the smell of sweet-cake, I looked
about for the table of refreshments; it was scarcely visible until one
had got accustomed to the gloom, but there was a cut-up plum cake upon
it, and there were cut-up oranges, and sandwiches, and biscuits, and two
decanters that I knew very well as ornaments, but had never seen used
in all my life; one full of port, and one of sherry. Standing at this
table, I became conscious of the servile Pumblechook in a black cloak
and several yards of hatband, who was alternately stuffing himself,
and making obsequious movements to catch my attention. The moment he (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>)
succeeded, he (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) came over to me -LRB-breathing sherry and crumbs-RRB-, and said
in a subdued voice, <div class="bookquote">``May I, dear sir?''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>and did. I then descried Mr. and
Mrs. Hubble; the last-named in a decent speechless paroxysm in a corner.
We were all going to <div class="bookquote">``follow,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Trabb/Trabb</b></font>)</div>and were all in course of being tied up
separately -LRB-by Trabb-RRB- into ridiculous bundles.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Which I meantersay, Pip,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>Joe whispered me, as we were being what Mr.
Trabb called <div class="bookquote">``formed''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Trabb/Trabb</b></font>)</div>in the parlor, two and two,--and it was dreadfully
like a preparation for some grim kind of dance; <div class="bookquote">``which I meantersay,
sir, as I would in preference have carried her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) to the church myself,
along with three or four friendly ones wot come to it with willing harts
and arms, but it were considered wot the neighbors would look down on
such and would be of opinions as it were wanting in respect.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Trabb/Trabb</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pocket-handkerchiefs out, all!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Trabb/Trabb</b></font>)</div>cried Mr. Trabb at this point, in a
depressed business-like voice. <div class="bookquote">``Pocket-handkerchiefs out! We are ready!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>So we all put our pocket-handkerchiefs to our faces, as if our
noses were bleeding, and filed out two and two; Joe and I; Biddy and
Pumblechook; Mr. and Mrs. Hubble. The remains of my poor sister had been
brought round by the kitchen door, and, it being a point of Undertaking
ceremony that the six bearers must be stifled and blinded under a
horrible black velvet housing with a white border, the whole looked like
a blind monster with twelve human legs, shuffling and blundering along,
under the guidance of two keepers,--the postboy and his (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) comrade.

<p/>The neighborhood, however, highly approved of these arrangements, and we
were much admired as we went through the village; the more youthful and
vigorous part of the community making dashes now and then to cut us off,
and lying in wait to intercept us at points of vantage. At such times
the more exuberant among them called out in an excited manner on our
emergence round some corner of expectancy, <div class="bookquote">``Here they come!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Here they
are!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>and we were all but cheered. In this progress I was much annoyed
by the abject Pumblechook, who, being behind me, persisted all the way
as a delicate attention in arranging my streaming hatband, and smoothing
my cloak. My thoughts were further distracted by the excessive pride of
Mr. and Mrs. Hubble, who were surpassingly conceited and vainglorious in
being members of so distinguished a procession.

<p/>And now the range of marshes lay clear before us, with the sails of the
ships on the river growing out of it; and we went into the churchyard,
close to the graves of my unknown parents, Philip Pirrip, late of this
parish, and Also Georgiana, Wife of the Above. And there, my sister was
laid quietly in the earth, while the larks sang high above it, and the
light wind strewed it with beautiful shadows of clouds and trees.

<p/>Of the conduct of the worldly minded Pumblechook while this was doing,
I desire to say no more than it was all addressed to me; and that even
when those noble passages were read which remind humanity how it brought
nothing into the world and can take nothing out, and how it fleeth like
a shadow and never continueth long in one stay, I heard him (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) cough a
reservation of the case of a young gentleman who came unexpectedly into
large property. When we got back, he (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) had the hardihood to tell me that
he (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) wished my sister could have known I had done her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) so much honor, and
to hint that she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) would have considered it reasonably purchased at the
price of her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) death. After that, he (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) drank all the rest of the sherry,
and Mr. Hubble drank the port, and the two talked -LRB-which I have since
observed to be customary in such cases-RRB- as if they were of quite another
race from the deceased, and were notoriously immortal. Finally, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hubble</b></font>) went
away with Mr. and Mrs. Hubble,--to make an evening of it, I felt sure,
and to tell the Jolly Bargemen that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bargemen</b></font>) was the founder of my fortunes
and my earliest benefactor.

<p/>When they were all gone, and when Trabb and his (<font color='blue'><b>Trabb</b></font>) men--but not his (<font color='blue'><b>Trabb</b></font>) Boy; I
looked for him (<font color='blue'><b>Trabb</b></font>)--had crammed their mummery into bags, and were gone too,
the house felt wholesomer. Soon afterwards, Biddy, Joe, and I, had a
cold dinner together; but we dined in the best parlor, not in the old
kitchen, and Joe was so exceedingly particular what he (<font color='blue'><b>Trabb</b></font>) did with his (<font color='blue'><b>Trabb</b></font>)
knife and fork and the saltcellar and what not, that there was great
restraint upon us. But after dinner, when I made him (<font color='blue'><b>Trabb</b></font>) take his (<font color='blue'><b>Trabb</b></font>) pipe,
and when I had loitered with him (<font color='blue'><b>Trabb</b></font>) about the forge, and when we sat down
together on the great block of stone outside it, we got on better. I
noticed that after the funeral Joe changed his (<font color='blue'><b>Trabb</b></font>) clothes so far, as to
make a compromise between his (<font color='blue'><b>Trabb</b></font>) Sunday dress and working dress; in which
the dear fellow looked natural, and like the Man he (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) was.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) was very much pleased by my asking if I might sleep in my own little
room, and I was pleased too; for I felt that I had done rather a great
thing in making the request. When the shadows of evening were closing
in, I took an opportunity of getting into the garden with Biddy for a
little talk.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Biddy,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, <div class="bookquote">``I think you might have written to me about these sad
matters.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you, Mr. Pip?''  (<font color='red'><b>Biddy</b></font>)</div>said Biddy. <div class="bookquote">``I should have written if I had thought
that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't suppose that I mean to be unkind, Biddy, when I say I consider
that you ought to have thought that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you, Mr. Pip?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Trabb</b></font>) was so quiet, and had such an orderly, good, and pretty way with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Trabb</b></font>), that I did not like the thought of making her (<font color='blue'><b>Trabb</b></font>) cry again. After
looking a little at her (<font color='blue'><b>Trabb</b></font>) downcast eyes as she (<font color='blue'><b>Trabb</b></font>) walked beside me, I gave up
that point.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose it will be difficult for you to remain here now, Biddy dear?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! I can't do so, Mr. Pip,''  (<font color='red'><b>Biddy</b></font>)</div>said Biddy, in a tone of regret but still
of quiet conviction. <div class="bookquote">``I have been speaking to Mrs. Hubble, and I am
going to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hubble</b></font>) to-morrow. I hope we shall be able to take some care of Mr.
Gargery, together, until he (<font color='blue'><b>Gargery</b></font>) settles down.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How are you going to live, Biddy? If you want any mo--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How am I going to live?''  (<font color='red'><b>Biddy</b></font>)</div>repeated Biddy, striking in, with a momentary
flush upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Trabb</b></font>) face. <div class="bookquote">``I'll tell you, Mr. Pip. I am going to try to get
the place of mistress in the new school nearly finished here. I can be
well recommended by all the neighbors, and I hope I can be industrious
and patient, and teach myself while I teach others. You know, Mr. Pip,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Biddy</b></font>)</div>pursued Biddy, with a smile, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Trabb</b></font>) raised her (<font color='blue'><b>Trabb</b></font>) eyes to my face, <div class="bookquote">``the new
schools are not like the old, but I learnt a good deal from you after
that time, and have had time since then to improve.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think you would always improve, Biddy, under any circumstances.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! Except in my bad side of human nature,''  (<font color='red'><b>Biddy</b></font>)</div>murmured Biddy.

<p/>It was not so much a reproach as an irresistible thinking aloud. Well!
I thought I would give up that point too. So, I walked a little further
with Biddy, looking silently at her (<font color='blue'><b>Trabb</b></font>) downcast eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have not heard the particulars of my sister's death, Biddy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They are very slight, poor thing. She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) had been in one of her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) bad
states--though they had got better of late, rather than worse--for four
days, when she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) came out of it in the evening, just at tea-time, and said
quite plainly, `Joe.' As she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) had never said any word for a long while, I
ran and fetched in Mr. Gargery from the forge. She (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) made signs to me that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) wanted him (<font color='blue'><b>Gargery</b></font>) to sit down close to her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>), and wanted me to put her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) arms
round his (<font color='blue'><b>Gargery</b></font>) neck. So I put them round his (<font color='blue'><b>Gargery</b></font>) neck, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) laid her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) head down
on his (<font color='blue'><b>Gargery</b></font>) shoulder quite content and satisfied. And so she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) presently said
`Joe' again, and once `Pardon,' and once `Pip.' And so she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) never lifted
her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) head up any more, and it was just an hour later when we laid it down
on her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) own bed, because we found she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) was gone.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Biddy</b></font>)</div><p/>Biddy cried; the darkening garden, and the lane, and the stars that were
coming out, were blurred in my own sight.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing was ever discovered, Biddy?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you know what is become of Orlick?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should think from the color of his (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) clothes that he (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) is working in the
quarries.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course you have seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) then?--Why are you looking at that dark
tree in the lane?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) there, on the night she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) died.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That was not the last time either, Biddy?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; I have seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) there, since we have been walking here.--It is of
no use,''  (<font color='red'><b>Biddy</b></font>)</div>said Biddy, laying her (<font color='blue'><b>Trabb</b></font>) hand upon my arm, as I was for running
out, <div class="bookquote">``you know I would not deceive you; he (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) was not there a minute, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) is gone.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>It revived my utmost indignation to find that she (<font color='blue'><b>Trabb</b></font>) was still pursued by
this fellow, and I felt inveterate against him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>). I told her (<font color='blue'><b>Trabb</b></font>) so, and told
her (<font color='blue'><b>Trabb</b></font>) that I would spend any money or take any pains to drive him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) out of
that country. By degrees she (<font color='blue'><b>Trabb</b></font>) led me into more temperate talk, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Trabb</b></font>)
told me how Joe loved me, and how Joe never complained of anything,--she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>)
didn't say, of me; she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) had no need; I knew what she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) meant,--but ever did
his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) duty in his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) way of life, with a strong hand, a quiet tongue, and a
gentle heart.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed, it would be hard to say too much for him (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I; <div class="bookquote">``and Biddy,
we must often speak of these things, for of course I shall be often down
here now. I am not going to leave poor Joe alone.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Biddy said never a single word.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Biddy, don't you hear me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Mr. Pip.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not to mention your calling me Mr. Pip,--which appears to me to be in
bad taste, Biddy,--what do you mean?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What do I mean?''  (<font color='red'><b>Biddy</b></font>)</div>asked Biddy, timidly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Biddy,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, in a virtuously self-asserting manner, <div class="bookquote">``I must request
to know what you mean by this?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``By this?''  (<font color='red'><b>Biddy</b></font>)</div>said Biddy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, don't echo,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I retorted. <div class="bookquote">``You used not to echo, Biddy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Used not!''  (<font color='red'><b>Biddy</b></font>)</div>said Biddy. <div class="bookquote">``O Mr. Pip! Used!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Well! I rather thought I would give up that point too. After another
silent turn in the garden, I fell back on the main position.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Biddy,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, <div class="bookquote">``I made a remark respecting my coming down here often,
to see Joe, which you received with a marked silence. Have the goodness,
Biddy, to tell me why.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you quite sure, then, that you WILL come to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) often?''  (<font color='red'><b>Biddy</b></font>)</div>asked
Biddy, stopping in the narrow garden walk, and looking at me under the
stars with a clear and honest eye.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``O dear me!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, as if I found myself compelled to give up Biddy in
despair. <div class="bookquote">``This really is a very bad side of human nature! Don't say any
more, if you please, Biddy. This shocks me very much.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>For which cogent reason I kept Biddy at a distance during supper, and
when I went up to my own old little room, took as stately a leave of her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)
as I could, in my murmuring soul, deem reconcilable with the churchyard
and the event of the day. As often as I was restless in the night, and
that was every quarter of an hour, I reflected what an unkindness, what
an injury, what an injustice, Biddy had done me.

<p/>Early in the morning I was to go. Early in the morning I was out, and
looking in, unseen, at one of the wooden windows of the forge. There
I stood, for minutes, looking at Joe, already at work with a glow of
health and strength upon his (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) face that made it show as if the bright sun
of the life in store for him (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) were shining on it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good-bye, dear Joe!--No, don't wipe it off--for God's sake, give me your
blackened hand!--I shall be down soon and often.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never too soon, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>said Joe, <div class="bookquote">``and never too often, Pip!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div><p/>Biddy was waiting for me at the kitchen door, with a mug of new milk and
a crust of bread. <div class="bookquote">``Biddy,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, when I gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) my hand at parting,
<div class="bookquote">``I am not angry, but I am hurt.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, don't be hurt,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) pleaded quite pathetically; <div class="bookquote">``let only me be
hurt, if I have been ungenerous.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Once more, the mists were rising as I walked away. If they disclosed to
me, as I suspect they did, that I should not come back, and that Biddy
was quite right, all I can say is,--they were quite right too.




<p/>Chapter XXXVI

<p/>Herbert and I went on from bad to worse, in the way of increasing our
debts, looking into our affairs, leaving Margins, and the like exemplary
transactions; and Time went on, whether or no, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) has a way of doing;
and I came of age,--in fulfilment of Herbert's prediction, that I should
do so before I knew where I was.

<p/>Herbert himself had come of age eight months before me. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) had
nothing else than his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) majority to come into, the event did not make a
profound sensation in Barnard's Inn. But we had looked forward to
my one-and-twentieth birthday, with a crowd of speculations and
anticipations, for we had both considered that my guardian could hardly
help saying something definite on that occasion.

<p/>I had taken care to have it well understood in Little Britain when my
birthday was. On the day before it, I received an official note from
Wemmick, informing me that Mr. Jaggers would be glad if I would call
upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) at five in the afternoon of the auspicious day. This convinced
us that something great was to happen, and threw me into an unusual
flutter when I repaired to my guardian's office, a model of punctuality.

<p/>In the outer office Wemmick offered me his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) congratulations, and
incidentally rubbed the side of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) nose with a folded piece of
tissue-paper that I liked the look of. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) said nothing respecting
it, and motioned me with a nod into my guardian's room. It was November,
and my guardian was standing before his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) fire leaning his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) back against
the chimney-piece, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) hands under his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) coattails.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, Pip,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``I must call you Mr. Pip to-day. Congratulations,
Mr. Pip.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>We shook hands,--he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) was always a remarkably short shaker,--and I thanked
him (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Take a chair, Mr. Pip,''  (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div>said my guardian.

<p/>As I sat down, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) preserved his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) attitude and bent his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) brows at his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>)
boots, I felt at a disadvantage, which reminded me of that old time when
I had been put upon a tombstone. The two ghastly casts on the shelf
were not far from him (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>), and their expression was as if they were making a
stupid apoplectic attempt to attend to the conversation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now my young friend,''  (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div>my guardian began, as if I were a witness in the
box, <div class="bookquote">``I am going to have a word or two with you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>a witness</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you please, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you suppose,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jaggers/Jaggers/MR. JAGGERS</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Jaggers, bending forward to look at the
ground, and then throwing his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) head back to look at the ceiling,--<div class="bookquote">``what
do you suppose you are living at the rate of?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jaggers/Jaggers/MR. JAGGERS</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``At the rate of, sir?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``At,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jaggers/Jaggers/MR. JAGGERS</b></font>)</div>repeated Mr. Jaggers, still looking at the ceiling,
<div class="bookquote">``the--rate--of?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jaggers/Jaggers/MR. JAGGERS</b></font>)</div>And then looked all round the room, and paused with his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>)
pocket-handkerchief in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) hand, half-way to his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) nose.

<p/>I had looked into my affairs so often, that I had thoroughly destroyed
any slight notion I might ever have had of their bearings. Reluctantly,
I confessed myself quite unable to answer the question. This reply
seemed agreeable to Mr. Jaggers, who said, <div class="bookquote">``I thought so!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jaggers/Jaggers/MR. JAGGERS</b></font>)</div>and blew his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>)
nose with an air of satisfaction.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, I have asked you a question, my friend,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jaggers/Jaggers/MR. JAGGERS</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Jaggers. <div class="bookquote">``Have
you anything to ask me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course it would be a great relief to me to ask you several
questions, sir; but I remember your prohibition.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ask one,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jaggers/Jaggers/MR. JAGGERS</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Jaggers.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is my benefactor to be made known to me to-day?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No. Ask another.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is that confidence to be imparted to me soon?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Waive that, a moment,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jaggers/Jaggers/MR. JAGGERS</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Jaggers, <div class="bookquote">``and ask another.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jaggers/Jaggers/MR. JAGGERS</b></font>)</div><p/>I looked about me, but there appeared to be now no possible escape from
the inquiry, <div class="bookquote">``Have-I--anything to receive, sir?''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>On that, Mr. Jaggers
said, triumphantly, <div class="bookquote">``I thought we should come to it!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jaggers/Jaggers/MR. JAGGERS</b></font>)</div>and called to
Wemmick to give him (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) that piece of paper. Wemmick appeared, handed it in,
and disappeared.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, Mr. Pip,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jaggers/Jaggers/MR. JAGGERS</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Jaggers, <div class="bookquote">``attend, if you please. You have been
drawing pretty freely here; your name occurs pretty often in Wemmick's
cash-book; but you are in debt, of course?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jaggers/Jaggers/MR. JAGGERS</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am afraid I must say yes, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You know you must say yes; don't you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jaggers/Jaggers/MR. JAGGERS</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Jaggers.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't ask you what you owe, because you don't know; and if you did
know, you wouldn't tell me; you would say less. Yes, yes, my friend,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jaggers/Jaggers/MR. JAGGERS</b></font>)</div>cried Mr. Jaggers, waving his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) forefinger to stop me as I made a show
of protesting: <div class="bookquote">``it's likely enough that you think you wouldn't, but
you would. You'll excuse me, but I know better than you. Now, take this
piece of paper in your hand. You have got it? Very good. Now, unfold it
and tell me what it is.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``This is a bank-note,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, <div class="bookquote">``for five hundred pounds.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is a bank-note,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jaggers/Jaggers/MR. JAGGERS</b></font>)</div>repeated Mr. Jaggers, <div class="bookquote">``for five hundred pounds.
And a very handsome sum of money too, I think. You consider it so?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jaggers/Jaggers/MR. JAGGERS</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How could I do otherwise!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! But answer the question,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jaggers/Jaggers/MR. JAGGERS</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Jaggers.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Undoubtedly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You consider it, undoubtedly, a handsome sum of money. Now, that
handsome sum of money, Pip, is your own. It is a present to you on this
day, in earnest of your expectations. And at the rate of that handsome
sum of money per annum, and at no higher rate, you are to live until the
donor of the whole appears. That is to say, you will now take your money
affairs entirely into your own hands, and you will draw from Wemmick
one hundred and twenty-five pounds per quarter, until you are in
communication with the fountain-head, and no longer with the mere
agent. As I have told you before, I am the mere agent. I execute my
instructions, and I am paid for doing so. I think them injudicious, but
I am not paid for giving any opinion on their merits.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I was beginning to express my gratitude to my benefactor for the great
liberality with which I was treated, when Mr. Jaggers stopped me. <div class="bookquote">``I am
not paid, Pip,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>), coolly, <div class="bookquote">``to carry your words to any one;''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and
then gathered up his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) coat-tails, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) had gathered up the subject, and
stood frowning at his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) boots as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) suspected them of designs against
him (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>).

<p/>After a pause, I hinted,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There was a question just now, Mr. Jaggers, which you desired me to
waive for a moment. I hope I am doing nothing wrong in asking it again?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What is it?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>).

<p/>I might have known that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) would never help me out; but it took me aback
to have to shape the question afresh, as if it were quite new. <div class="bookquote">``Is it
likely,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said, after hesitating, <div class="bookquote">``that my patron, the fountain-head
you have spoken of, Mr. Jaggers, will soon--''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>there I delicately
stopped.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Will soon what?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jaggers/Jaggers/MR. JAGGERS</b></font>)</div>asked Mr. Jaggers. <div class="bookquote">``That's no question as it stands,
you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Will soon come to London,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, after casting about for a precise
form of words, <div class="bookquote">``or summon me anywhere else?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, here,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jaggers/Jaggers/MR. JAGGERS</b></font>)</div>replied Mr. Jaggers, fixing me for the first time with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) dark deep-set eyes, <div class="bookquote">``we must revert to the evening when we first
encountered one another in your village. What did I tell you then, Pip?''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You told me, Mr. Jaggers, that it might be years hence when that person
appeared.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Just so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jaggers/Jaggers/MR. JAGGERS</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Jaggers, <div class="bookquote">``that's my answer.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jaggers/Jaggers/MR. JAGGERS</b></font>)</div><p/>As we looked full at one another, I felt my breath come quicker in my
strong desire to get something out of him (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>). And as I felt that it came
quicker, and as I felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) saw that it came quicker, I felt that I
had less chance than ever of getting anything out of him (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you suppose it will still be years hence, Mr. Jaggers?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jaggers/Jaggers/MR. JAGGERS</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Jaggers shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) head,--not in negativing the question, but in
altogether negativing the notion that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) could anyhow be got to answer
it,--and the two horrible casts of the twitched faces looked, when
my eyes strayed up to them, as if they had come to a crisis in their
suspended attention, and were going to sneeze.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jaggers/Jaggers/MR. JAGGERS</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Jaggers, warming the backs of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) legs with the backs
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) warmed hands, <div class="bookquote">``I'll be plain with you, my friend Pip. That's a
question I must not be asked. You'll understand that better, when I tell
you it's a question that might compromise me. Come! I'll go a little
further with you; I'll say something more.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jaggers/Jaggers/MR. JAGGERS</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) bent down so low to frown at his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) boots, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) was able to rub the
calves of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) legs in the pause he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) made.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``When that person discloses,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jaggers/Jaggers/MR. JAGGERS</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Jaggers, straightening himself,
<div class="bookquote">``you and that person will settle your own affairs. When that person
discloses, my part in this business will cease and determine. When that
person discloses, it will not be necessary for me to know anything about
it. And that's all I have got to say.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jaggers/Jaggers/MR. JAGGERS</b></font>)</div><p/>We looked at one another until I withdrew my eyes, and looked
thoughtfully at the floor. From this last speech I derived the notion
that Miss Havisham, for some reason or no reason, had not taken him (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>)
into her (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) confidence as to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) designing me for Estella; that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) resented
this, and felt a jealousy about it; or that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) really did object to
that scheme, and would have nothing to do with it. When I raised my eyes
again, I found that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) had been shrewdly looking at me all the time, and
was doing so still.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If that is all you have to say, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I remarked, <div class="bookquote">``there can be nothing
left for me to say.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) nodded assent, and pulled out his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) thief-dreaded watch, and asked me
where I was going to dine? I replied at my own chambers, with Herbert.
As a necessary sequence, I asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) would favor us with his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>)
company, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) promptly accepted the invitation. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) insisted on
walking home with me, in order that I might make no extra preparation
for him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>), and first he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) had a letter or two to write, and -LRB-of course-RRB- had
his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) hands to wash. So I said I would go into the outer office and talk
to Wemmick.

<p/>The fact was, that when the five hundred pounds had come into my pocket,
a thought had come into my head which had been often there before;
and it appeared to me that Wemmick was a good person to advise with
concerning such thought.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) had already locked up his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) safe, and made preparations for going home.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) had left his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) desk, brought out his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) two greasy office candlesticks and
stood them in line with the snuffers on a slab near the door, ready to
be extinguished; he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) had raked his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) fire low, put his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) hat and great-coat
ready, and was beating himself all over the chest with his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) safe-key, as
an athletic exercise after business.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Wemmick,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, <div class="bookquote">``I want to ask your opinion. I am very desirous
to serve a friend.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Wemmick tightened his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) post-office and shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) head, as if his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) opinion
were dead against any fatal weakness of that sort.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This friend,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I pursued, <div class="bookquote">``is trying to get on in commercial life,
but has no money, and finds it difficult and disheartening to make a
beginning. Now I want somehow to help him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) to a beginning.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``With money down?''  (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div>said Wemmick, in a tone drier than any sawdust.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``With some money down,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I replied, for an uneasy remembrance shot across
me of that symmetrical bundle of papers at home--<div class="bookquote">``with some money down,
and perhaps some anticipation of my expectations.''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Pip,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div>said Wemmick, <div class="bookquote">``I should like just to run over with you on my
fingers, if you please, the names of the various bridges up as high
as Chelsea Reach. Let's see; there's London, one; Southwark, two;
Blackfriars, three; Waterloo, four; Westminster, five; Vauxhall, six.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) had checked off each bridge in its turn, with the handle of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>)
safe-key on the palm of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) hand. <div class="bookquote">``There's as many as six, you see, to
choose from.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't understand you,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Choose your bridge, Mr. Pip,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>returned Wemmick, <div class="bookquote">``and take a walk upon
your bridge, and pitch your money into the Thames over the centre arch
of your bridge, and you know the end of it. Serve a friend with it, and
you may know the end of it too,--but it's a less pleasant and profitable
end.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div><p/>I could have posted a newspaper in his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) mouth, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) made it so wide after
saying this.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This is very discouraging,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Meant to be so,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said Wemmick.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then is it your opinion,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I inquired, with some little indignation,
<div class="bookquote">``that a man should never--''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``--Invest portable property in a friend?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said Wemmick. <div class="bookquote">``Certainly
he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) should not. Unless he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) wants to get rid of the friend,--and then it
becomes a question how much portable property it may be worth to get rid
of him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And that,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, <div class="bookquote">``is your deliberate opinion, Mr. Wemmick?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) returned, <div class="bookquote">``is my deliberate opinion in this office.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, pressing him (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>), for I thought I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) near a loophole
here; <div class="bookquote">``but would that be your opinion at Walworth?''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Pip,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) replied, with gravity, <div class="bookquote">``Walworth is one place, and this
office is another. Much as the Aged is one person, and Mr. Jaggers is
another. They must not be confounded together. My Walworth sentiments
must be taken at Walworth; none but my official sentiments can be taken
in this office.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, much relieved, <div class="bookquote">``then I shall look you up at
Walworth, you may depend upon it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Pip,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) returned, <div class="bookquote">``you will be welcome there, in a private and
personal capacity.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>We had held this conversation in a low voice, well knowing my guardian's
ears to be the sharpest of the sharp. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) now appeared in his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) doorway,
towelling his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) hands, Wemmick got on his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) great-coat and stood by to snuff
out the candles. We all three went into the street together, and from
the door-step Wemmick turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) way, and Mr. Jaggers and I turned ours.

<p/>I could not help wishing more than once that evening, that Mr. Jaggers
had had an Aged in Gerrard Street, or a Stinger, or a Something, or
a Somebody, to unbend his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) brows a little. It was an uncomfortable
consideration on a twenty-first birthday, that coming of age at all
seemed hardly worth while in such a guarded and suspicious world as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>)
made of it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) was a thousand times better informed and cleverer than
Wemmick, and yet I would a thousand times rather have had Wemmick to
dinner. And Mr. Jaggers made not me alone intensely melancholy, because,
after he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) was gone, Herbert said of himself, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) eyes fixed on the
fire, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) must have committed a felony and forgotten the
details of it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) felt so dejected and guilty.




<p/>Chapter XXXVII

<p/>Deeming Sunday the best day for taking Mr. Wemmick's Walworth
sentiments, I devoted the next ensuing Sunday afternoon to a pilgrimage
to the Castle. On arriving before the battlements, I found the Union
Jack flying and the drawbridge up; but undeterred by this show of
defiance and resistance, I rang at the gate, and was admitted in a most
pacific manner by the Aged.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My son, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the old man, after securing the drawbridge, <div class="bookquote">``rather
had it in his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) mind that you might happen to drop in, and he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) left word
that he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) would soon be home from his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) afternoon's walk. He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) is very regular
in his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) walks, is my son. Very regular in everything, is my son.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/>I nodded at the old gentleman as Wemmick himself might have nodded, and
we went in and sat down by the fireside.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You made acquaintance with my son, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the old man, in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
chirping way, while he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) warmed his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hands at the blaze, <div class="bookquote">``at his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) office, I
expect?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>I nodded. <div class="bookquote">``Hah! I have heerd that my son is a wonderful hand at
his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) business, sir?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I nodded hard. <div class="bookquote">``Yes; so they tell me. His (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) business
is the Law?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I nodded harder. <div class="bookquote">``Which makes it more surprising in my
son,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the old man, <div class="bookquote">``for he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) was not brought up to the Law, but to
the Wine-Coopering.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/>Curious to know how the old gentleman stood informed concerning the
reputation of Mr. Jaggers, I roared that name at him (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) threw me into
the greatest confusion by laughing heartily and replying in a very
sprightly manner, <div class="bookquote">``No, to be sure; you're right.''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>And to this hour I
have not the faintest notion what he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) meant, or what joke he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) thought I
had made.

<p/>As I could not sit there nodding at him (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) perpetually, without making
some other attempt to interest him (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>), I shouted at inquiry whether his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) own
calling in life had been <div class="bookquote">``the Wine-Coopering.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>By dint of straining that
term out of myself several times and tapping the old gentleman on the
chest to associate it with him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>), I at last succeeded in making my meaning
understood.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>said the old gentleman; <div class="bookquote">``the warehousing, the warehousing. First,
over yonder;''  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) appeared to mean up the chimney, but I believe he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
intended to refer me to Liverpool; <div class="bookquote">``and then in the City of London here.
However, having an infirmity--for I am hard of hearing, sir--''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>I expressed in pantomime the greatest astonishment.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``--Yes, hard of hearing; having that infirmity coming upon me, my son he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)
went into the Law, and he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) took charge of me, and he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) by little and little
made out this elegant and beautiful property. But returning to what you
said, you know,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>pursued the old man, again laughing heartily, <div class="bookquote">``what I
say is, No to be sure; you're right.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/>I was modestly wondering whether my utmost ingenuity would have enabled
me to say anything that would have amused him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) half as much as this
imaginary pleasantry, when I was startled by a sudden click in the wall
on one side of the chimney, and the ghostly tumbling open of a little
wooden flap with <div class="bookquote">``JOHN''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>upon it. The old man, following my eyes, cried
with great triumph, <div class="bookquote">``My son's come home!''  (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div>and we both went out to the
drawbridge.

<p/>It was worth any money to see Wemmick waving a salute to me from the
other side of the moat, when we might have shaken hands across it with
the greatest ease. The Aged was so delighted to work the drawbridge,
that I made no offer to assist him (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>), but stood quiet until Wemmick had
come across, and had presented me to Miss Skiffins; a lady by whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>)
was accompanied.

<p/>Miss Skiffins was of a wooden appearance, and was, like her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) escort, in
the post-office branch of the service. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) might have been some two or
three years younger than Wemmick, and I judged her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) to stand possessed
of portable property. The cut of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) dress from the waist upward, both
before and behind, made her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) figure very like a boy's kite; and I might
have pronounced her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) gown a little too decidedly orange, and her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) gloves a
little too intensely green. But she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) seemed to be a good sort of fellow,
and showed a high regard for the Aged. I was not long in discovering
that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was a frequent visitor at the Castle; for, on our going in,
and my complimenting Wemmick on his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) ingenious contrivance for announcing
himself to the Aged, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) begged me to give my attention for a moment to
the other side of the chimney, and disappeared. Presently another click
came, and another little door tumbled open with <div class="bookquote">``Miss Skiffins''  (<font color='red'><b>John</b></font>)</div>on it;
then Miss Skiffins shut up and John tumbled open; then Miss Skiffins
and John both tumbled open together, and finally shut up together. On
Wemmick's return from working these mechanical appliances, I expressed
the great admiration with which I regarded them, and he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Well, you
know, they're both pleasant and useful to the Aged. And by George, sir,
it's a thing worth mentioning, that of all the people who come to
this gate, the secret of those pulls is only known to the Aged, Miss
Skiffins, and me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And Mr. Wemmick made them,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Skiffins</b></font>)</div>added Miss Skiffins, <div class="bookquote">``with his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) own hands
out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) own head.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Skiffins</b></font>)</div><p/>While Miss Skiffins was taking off her (<font color='blue'><b>Skiffins</b></font>) bonnet -LRB-she (<font color='blue'><b>Skiffins</b></font>) retained her (<font color='blue'><b>Skiffins</b></font>) green
gloves during the evening as an outward and visible sign that there was
company-RRB-, Wemmick invited me to take a walk with him (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) round the property,
and see how the island looked in wintertime. Thinking that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) did this
to give me an opportunity of taking his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) Walworth sentiments, I seized
the opportunity as soon as we were out of the Castle.

<p/>Having thought of the matter with care, I approached my subject as if I
had never hinted at it before. I informed Wemmick that I was anxious in
behalf of Herbert Pocket, and I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) how we had first met, and how
we had fought. I glanced at Herbert's home, and at his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) character, and
at his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) having no means but such as he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) was dependent on his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) father for;
those, uncertain and unpunctual. I alluded to the advantages I had
derived in my first rawness and ignorance from his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) society, and I
confessed that I feared I had but ill repaid them, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) might
have done better without me and my expectations. Keeping Miss Havisham
in the background at a great distance, I still hinted at the possibility
of my having competed with him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) prospects, and at the certainty of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) possessing a generous soul, and being far above any mean distrusts,
retaliations, or designs. For all these reasons -LRB-I told Wemmick-RRB-,
and because he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) was my young companion and friend, and I had a great
affection for him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>), I wished my own good fortune to reflect some rays
upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>), and therefore I sought advice from Wemmick's experience and
knowledge of men and affairs, how I could best try with my resources to
help Herbert to some present income,--say of a hundred a year, to keep
him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) in good hope and heart,--and gradually to buy him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) on to some small
partnership. I begged Wemmick, in conclusion, to understand that my help
must always be rendered without Herbert's knowledge or suspicion, and
that there was no one else in the world with whom I could advise. I
wound up by laying my hand upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) shoulder, and saying, <div class="bookquote">``I can't help
confiding in you, though I know it must be troublesome to you; but that
is your fault, in having ever brought me here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Wemmick was silent for a little while, and then said with a kind of
start, <div class="bookquote">``Well you know, Mr. Pip, I must tell you one thing. This is
devilish good of you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Say you'll help me to be good then,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ecod,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>replied Wemmick, shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) head, <div class="bookquote">``that's not my trade.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nor is this your trading-place,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are right,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) returned. <div class="bookquote">``You hit the nail on the head. Mr. Pip,
I'll put on my considering-cap, and I think all you want to do may be
done by degrees. Skiffins -LRB-that's her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) brother-RRB- is an accountant and
agent. I'll look him (<font color='blue'><b>agent</b></font>) up and go to work for you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I thank you ten thousand times.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``On the contrary,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``I thank you, for though we are strictly in
our private and personal capacity, still it may be mentioned that there
are Newgate cobwebs about, and it brushes them away.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>After a little further conversation to the same effect, we returned into
the Castle where we found Miss Skiffins preparing tea. The responsible
duty of making the toast was delegated to the Aged, and that excellent
old gentleman was so intent upon it that he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) seemed to me in some danger
of melting his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) eyes. It was no nominal meal that we were going to make,
but a vigorous reality. The Aged prepared such a hay-stack of buttered
toast, that I could scarcely see him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) over it as it simmered on an iron
stand hooked on to the top-bar; while Miss Skiffins brewed such a jorum
of tea, that the pig in the back premises became strongly excited, and
repeatedly expressed his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) desire to participate in the entertainment.

<p/>The flag had been struck, and the gun had been fired, at the right
moment of time, and I felt as snugly cut off from the rest of Walworth
as if the moat were thirty feet wide by as many deep. Nothing disturbed
the tranquillity of the Castle, but the occasional tumbling open of
John and Miss Skiffins: which little doors were a prey to some spasmodic
infirmity that made me sympathetically uncomfortable until I got used
to it. I inferred from the methodical nature of Miss Skiffins's
arrangements that she (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) made tea there every Sunday night; and I rather
suspected that a classic brooch she (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) wore, representing the profile of an
undesirable female with a very straight nose and a very new moon, was a
piece of portable property that had been given her (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) by Wemmick.

<p/>We ate the whole of the toast, and drank tea in proportion, and it was
delightful to see how warm and greasy we all got after it. The Aged
especially, might have passed for some clean old chief of a savage
tribe, just oiled. After a short pause of repose, Miss Skiffins--in the
absence of the little servant who, it seemed, retired to the bosom of
her (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) family on Sunday afternoons--washed up the tea-things, in a trifling
lady-like amateur manner that compromised none of us. Then, she (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) put on
her (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) gloves again, and we drew round the fire, and Wemmick said, <div class="bookquote">``Now,
Aged Parent, tip us the paper.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div><p/>Wemmick explained to me while the Aged got his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) spectacles out, that this
was according to custom, and that it gave the old gentleman infinite
satisfaction to read the news aloud. <div class="bookquote">``I won't offer an apology,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div>said
Wemmick, <div class="bookquote">``for he (<font color='blue'><b>agent</b></font>) isn't capable of many pleasures--are you, Aged P.?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``All right, John, all right,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>returned the old man, seeing himself
spoken to.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Only tip him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) a nod every now and then when he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) looks off his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) paper,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div>said Wemmick, <div class="bookquote">``and he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)'ll be as happy as a king. We are all attention,
Aged One.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``All right, John, all right!''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>returned the cheerful old man, so busy and
so pleased, that it really was quite charming.

<p/>The Aged's reading reminded me of the classes at Mr. Wopsle's
great-aunt's, with the pleasanter peculiarity that it seemed to come
through a keyhole. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) wanted the candles close to him (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>), and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) was
always on the verge of putting either his (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) head or the newspaper into
them, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) required as much watching as a powder-mill. But Wemmick was
equally untiring and gentle in his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) vigilance, and the Aged read on,
quite unconscious of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) many rescues. Whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) looked at us, we
all expressed the greatest interest and amazement, and nodded until he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>)
resumed again.

<p/>As Wemmick and Miss Skiffins sat side by side, and as I sat in a shadowy
corner, I observed a slow and gradual elongation of Mr. Wemmick's mouth,
powerfully suggestive of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) slowly and gradually stealing his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) arm round
Miss Skiffins's waist. In course of time I saw his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) hand appear on the
other side of Miss Skiffins; but at that moment Miss Skiffins neatly
stopped him (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) with the green glove, unwound his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) arm again as if it were
an article of dress, and with the greatest deliberation laid it on the
table before her (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>). Miss Skiffins's composure while she (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) did this was one
of the most remarkable sights I have ever seen, and if I could have
thought the act consistent with abstraction of mind, I should have
deemed that Miss Skiffins performed it mechanically.

<p/>By and by, I noticed Wemmick's arm beginning to disappear again, and
gradually fading out of view. Shortly afterwards, his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) mouth began to
widen again. After an interval of suspense on my part that was quite
enthralling and almost painful, I saw his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) hand appear on the other side
of Miss Skiffins. Instantly, Miss Skiffins stopped it with the neatness
of a placid boxer, took off that girdle or cestus as before, and laid
it on the table. Taking the table to represent the path of virtue, I am
justified in stating that during the whole time of the Aged's reading,
Wemmick's arm was straying from the path of virtue and being recalled to
it by Miss Skiffins.

<p/>At last, the Aged read himself into a light slumber. This was the time
for Wemmick to produce a little kettle, a tray of glasses, and a
black bottle with a porcelain-topped cork, representing some clerical
dignitary of a rubicund and social aspect. With the aid of these
appliances we all had something warm to drink, including the Aged, who
was soon awake again. Miss Skiffins mixed, and I observed that she (<font color='blue'><b>dignitary</b></font>) and
Wemmick drank out of one glass. Of course I knew better than to offer to
see Miss Skiffins home, and under the circumstances I thought I had best
go first; which I did, taking a cordial leave of the Aged, and having
passed a pleasant evening.

<p/>Before a week was out, I received a note from Wemmick, dated Walworth,
stating that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) hoped he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) had made some advance in that matter
appertaining to our private and personal capacities, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) would
be glad if I could come and see him (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) again upon it. So, I went out
to Walworth again, and yet again, and yet again, and I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) by
appointment in the City several times, but never held any communication
with him (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) on the subject in or near Little Britain. The upshot was,
that we found a worthy young merchant or shipping-broker, not long
established in business, who wanted intelligent help, and who wanted
capital, and who in due course of time and receipt would want a partner.
Between him (<font color='blue'><b>merchant</b></font>) and me, secret articles were signed of which Herbert was the
subject, and I paid him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) half of my five hundred pounds down, and engaged
for sundry other payments: some, to fall due at certain dates out of my
income: some, contingent on my coming into my property. Miss Skiffins's
brother conducted the negotiation. Wemmick pervaded it throughout, but
never appeared in it.

<p/>The whole business was so cleverly managed, that Herbert had not the
least suspicion of my hand being in it. I never shall forget the radiant
face with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) came home one afternoon, and told me, as a mighty
piece of news, of his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) having fallen in with one Clarriker -LRB-the young
merchant's name-RRB-, and of Clarriker's having shown an extraordinary
inclination towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>), and of his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) belief that the opening had come at
last. Day by day as his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) hopes grew stronger and his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) face brighter, he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>)
must have thought me a more and more affectionate friend, for I had the
greatest difficulty in restraining my tears of triumph when I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) so
happy. At length, the thing being done, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) having that day entered
Clarriker's House, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) having talked to me for a whole evening in a
flush of pleasure and success, I did really cry in good earnest when
I went to bed, to think that my expectations had done some good to
somebody.

<p/>A great event in my life, the turning point of my life, now opens on my
view. But, before I proceed to narrate it, and before I pass on to all
the changes it involved, I must give one chapter to Estella. It is not
much to give to the theme that so long filled my heart.




<p/>Chapter XXXVIII

<p/>If that staid old house near the Green at Richmond should ever come to
be haunted when I am dead, it will be haunted, surely, by my ghost. O
the many, many nights and days through which the unquiet spirit within
me haunted that house when Estella lived there! Let my body be where it
would, my spirit was always wandering, wandering, wandering, about that
house.

<p/>The lady with whom Estella was placed, Mrs. Brandley by name, was a
widow, with one daughter several years older than Estella. The mother
looked young, and the daughter looked old; the mother's complexion was
pink, and the daughter's was yellow; the mother set up for frivolity,
and the daughter for theology. They were in what is called a good
position, and visited, and were visited by, numbers of people. Little,
if any, community of feeling subsisted between them and Estella, but the
understanding was established that they were necessary to her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>), and
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) was necessary to them. Mrs. Brandley had been a friend of Miss
Havisham's before the time of her (<font color='blue'><b>Brandley</b></font>) seclusion.

<p/>In Mrs. Brandley's house and out of Mrs. Brandley's house, I suffered
every kind and degree of torture that Estella could cause me. The
nature of my relations with her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>), which placed me on terms of familiarity
without placing me on terms of favor, conduced to my distraction.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) made use of me to tease other admirers, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) turned the very
familiarity between herself and me to the account of putting a constant
slight on my devotion to her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>). If I had been her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) secretary, steward,
half-brother, poor relation,--if I had been a younger brother of her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>)
appointed husband,--I could not have seemed to myself further from my
hopes when I was nearest to her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>). The privilege of calling her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) by her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>)
name and hearing her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) call me by mine became, under the circumstances
an aggravation of my trials; and while I think it likely that it almost
maddened her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) other lovers, I know too certainly that it almost maddened
me.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) had admirers without end. No doubt my jealousy made an admirer of
every one who went near her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>); but there were more than enough of them
without that.

<p/>I saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) often at Richmond, I heard of her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) often in town, and I used
often to take her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) and the Brandleys on the water; there were picnics,
fête days, plays, operas, concerts, parties, all sorts of pleasures,
through which I pursued her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>),--and they were all miseries to me. I never
had one hour's happiness in her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) society, and yet my mind all round the
four-and-twenty hours was harping on the happiness of having her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) with me
unto death.

<p/>Throughout this part of our intercourse,--and it lasted, as will
presently be seen, for what I then thought a long time,--she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) habitually
reverted to that tone which expressed that our association was forced
upon us. There were other times when she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) would come to a sudden check in
this tone and in all her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) many tones, and would seem to pity me.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Pip, Pip,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) said one evening, coming to such a check, when we sat
apart at a darkening window of the house in Richmond; <div class="bookquote">``will you never
take warning?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of what?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Warning not to be attracted by you, do you mean, Estella?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do I mean! If you don't know what I mean, you are blind.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I should have replied that Love was commonly reputed blind, but for the
reason that I always was restrained--and this was not the least of my
miseries--by a feeling that it was ungenerous to press myself upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>),
when she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) knew that she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) could not choose but obey Miss Havisham. My
dread always was, that this knowledge on her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) part laid me under a heavy
disadvantage with her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) pride, and made me the subject of a rebellious
struggle in her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) bosom.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``At any rate,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, <div class="bookquote">``I have no warning given me just now, for you
wrote to me to come to you, this time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's true,''  (<font color='red'><b>Estella/Miss Estella/ESTELLA</b></font>)</div>said Estella, with a cold careless smile that always
chilled me.

<p/>After looking at the twilight without, for a little while, she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) went on
to say:--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The time has come round when Miss Havisham wishes to have me for a day
at Satis. You are to take me there, and bring me back, if you will. She (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>)
would rather I did not travel alone, and objects to receiving my maid,
for she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) has a sensitive horror of being talked of by such people. Can
you take me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Can I take you, Estella!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You can then? The day after to-morrow, if you please. You are to pay
all charges out of my purse, You hear the condition of your going?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And must obey,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I.

<p/>This was all the preparation I received for that visit, or for others
like it; Miss Havisham never wrote to me, nor had I ever so much as seen
her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) handwriting. We went down on the next day but one, and we found her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>)
in the room where I had first beheld her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>), and it is needless to add that
there was no change in Satis House.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) was even more dreadfully fond of Estella than she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) had been when
I last saw them together; I repeat the word advisedly, for there was
something positively dreadful in the energy of her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) looks and embraces.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) hung upon Estella's beauty, hung upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) words, hung upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>)
gestures, and sat mumbling her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) own trembling fingers while she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) looked at
her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>), as though she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) were devouring the beautiful creature she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) had reared.

<p/>From Estella she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) looked at me, with a searching glance that seemed to
pry into my heart and probe its wounds. <div class="bookquote">``How does she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) use you, Pip; how
does she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) use you?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) asked me again, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) witch-like eagerness,
even in Estella's hearing. But, when we sat by her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) flickering fire
at night, she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) was most weird; for then, keeping Estella's hand drawn
through her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) arm and clutched in her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) own hand, she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) extorted from her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>),
by dint of referring back to what Estella had told her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) regular
letters, the names and conditions of the men whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) had fascinated;
and as Miss Havisham dwelt upon this roll, with the intensity of a mind
mortally hurt and diseased, she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) sat with her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) other hand on her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) crutch
stick, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) chin on that, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) wan bright eyes glaring at me, a
very spectre.

<p/>I saw in this, wretched though it made me, and bitter the sense of
dependence and even of degradation that it awakened,--I saw in this that
Estella was set to wreak Miss Havisham's revenge on men, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>)
was not to be given to me until she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) had gratified it for a term. I saw
in this, a reason for her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) being beforehand assigned to me. Sending her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>)
out to attract and torment and do mischief, Miss Havisham sent her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) with
the malicious assurance that she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) was beyond the reach of all admirers,
and that all who staked upon that cast were secured to lose. I saw in
this that I, too, was tormented by a perversion of ingenuity, even while
the prize was reserved for me. I saw in this the reason for my being
staved off so long and the reason for my late guardian's declining to
commit himself to the formal knowledge of such a scheme. In a word, I
saw in this Miss Havisham as I had her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) then and there before my eyes,
and always had had her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) before my eyes; and I saw in this, the distinct
shadow of the darkened and unhealthy house in which her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) life was hidden
from the sun.

<p/>The candles that lighted that room of hers were placed in sconces on
the wall. They were high from the ground, and they burnt with the steady
dulness of artificial light in air that is seldom renewed. As I looked
round at them, and at the pale gloom they made, and at the stopped
clock, and at the withered articles of bridal dress upon the table and
the ground, and at her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) own awful figure with its ghostly reflection
thrown large by the fire upon the ceiling and the wall, I saw in
everything the construction that my mind had come to, repeated and
thrown back to me. My thoughts passed into the great room across the
landing where the table was spread, and I saw it written, as it were, in
the falls of the cobwebs from the centre-piece, in the crawlings of the
spiders on the cloth, in the tracks of the mice as they betook their
little quickened hearts behind the panels, and in the gropings and
pausings of the beetles on the floor.

<p/>It happened on the occasion of this visit that some sharp words arose
between Estella and Miss Havisham. It was the first time I had ever seen
them opposed.

<p/>We were seated by the fire, as just now described, and Miss Havisham
still had Estella's arm drawn through her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) own, and still clutched
Estella's hand in hers, when Estella gradually began to detach herself.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) had shown a proud impatience more than once before, and had rather
endured that fierce affection than accepted or returned it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What!''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Havisham</b></font>)</div>said Miss Havisham, flashing her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) eyes upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``are you tired
of me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Only a little tired of myself,''  (<font color='red'><b>Estella/Miss Estella/ESTELLA</b></font>)</div>replied Estella, disengaging her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) arm,
and moving to the great chimney-piece, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) stood looking down at
the fire.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Speak the truth, you ingrate!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>cried Miss Havisham, passionately
striking her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) stick upon the floor; <div class="bookquote">``you are tired of me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Estella/Miss Estella/ESTELLA</b></font>)</div><p/>Estella looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) with perfect composure, and again looked down
at the fire. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) graceful figure and her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) beautiful face expressed a
self-possessed indifference to the wild heat of the other, that was
almost cruel.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You stock and stone!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Miss Havisham. <div class="bookquote">``You cold, cold heart!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What?''  (<font color='red'><b>Estella/Miss Estella/ESTELLA</b></font>)</div>said Estella, preserving her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) attitude of indifference as she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>)
leaned against the great chimney-piece and only moving her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) eyes; <div class="bookquote">``do you
reproach me for being cold? You?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you not?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was the fierce retort.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You should know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Estella/Miss Estella/ESTELLA</b></font>)</div>said Estella. <div class="bookquote">``I am what you have made me. Take
all the praise, take all the blame; take all the success, take all the

yielding either to anger or tenderness,--<div class="bookquote">``mother by adoption, I have

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But to be proud and hard to me!''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Havisham</b></font>)</div>Miss Havisham quite shrieked, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>)
stretched out her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) arms. <div class="bookquote">``Estella, Estella, Estella, to be proud and hard
to me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Estella/Miss Estella/ESTELLA</b></font>)</div><p/>Estella looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) for a moment with a kind of calm wonder, but was
not otherwise disturbed; when the moment was past, she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) looked down at
the fire again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I cannot think,''  (<font color='red'><b>Estella/Miss Estella/ESTELLA</b></font>)</div>said Estella, raising her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) eyes after a silence <div class="bookquote">``why
you should be so unreasonable when I come to see you after a separation.
I have never forgotten your wrongs and their causes. I have never been
unfaithful to you or your schooling. I have never shown any weakness
that I can charge myself with.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Estella/Miss Estella/ESTELLA</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Would it be weakness to return my love?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Miss Havisham. <div class="bookquote">``But
yes, yes, she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) would call it so!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I begin to think,''  (<font color='red'><b>Estella/Miss Estella/ESTELLA</b></font>)</div>said Estella, in a musing way, after another moment
of calm wonder, <div class="bookquote">``that I almost understand how this comes about. If you
had brought up your adopted daughter wholly in the dark confinement of
these rooms, and had never let her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) know that there was such a thing as
the daylight by which she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) had never once seen your face,--if you had
done that, and then, for a purpose had wanted her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) to understand the
daylight and know all about it, you would have been disappointed and
angry?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Estella/Miss Estella/ESTELLA</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Havisham, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) head in her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) hands, sat making a low moaning, and
swaying herself on her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) chair, but gave no answer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Or,''  (<font color='red'><b>Estella/Miss Estella/ESTELLA</b></font>)</div>said Estella,--<div class="bookquote">``which is a nearer case,--if you had taught her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>),
from the dawn of her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) intelligence, with your utmost energy and might,
that there was such a thing as daylight, but that it was made to be her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>)
enemy and destroyer, and she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) must always turn against it, for it had
blighted you and would else blight her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>);--if you had done this, and then,
for a purpose, had wanted her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) to take naturally to the daylight and she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>)
could not do it, you would have been disappointed and angry?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Estella/Miss Estella/ESTELLA</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Havisham sat listening -LRB-or it seemed so, for I could not see her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>)
face-RRB-, but still made no answer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So,''  (<font color='red'><b>Estella/Miss Estella/ESTELLA</b></font>)</div>said Estella, <div class="bookquote">``I must be taken as I have been made. The success is
not mine, the failure is not mine, but the two together make me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Estella/Miss Estella/ESTELLA</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Havisham had settled down, I hardly knew how, upon the floor, among
the faded bridal relics with which it was strewn. I took advantage of
the moment--I had sought one from the first--to leave the room, after
beseeching Estella's attention to her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>), with a movement of my hand. When
I left, Estella was yet standing by the great chimney-piece, just as she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>)
had stood throughout. Miss Havisham's gray hair was all adrift upon the
ground, among the other bridal wrecks, and was a miserable sight to see.

<p/>It was with a depressed heart that I walked in the starlight for an
hour and more, about the courtyard, and about the brewery, and about
the ruined garden. When I at last took courage to return to the room, I
found Estella sitting at Miss Havisham's knee, taking up some stitches
in one of those old articles of dress that were dropping to pieces, and
of which I have often been reminded since by the faded tatters of old
banners that I have seen hanging up in cathedrals. Afterwards, Estella
and I played at cards, as of yore,--only we were skilful now, and played
French games,--and so the evening wore away, and I went to bed.

<p/>I lay in that separate building across the courtyard. It was the first
time I had ever lain down to rest in Satis House, and sleep refused to
come near me. A thousand Miss Havishams haunted me. She (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) was on this side
of my pillow, on that, at the head of the bed, at the foot, behind the
half-opened door of the dressing-room, in the dressing-room, in the room
overhead, in the room beneath,--everywhere. At last, when the night was
slow to creep on towards two o’clock, I felt that I absolutely could no
longer bear the place as a place to lie down in, and that I must get up.
I therefore got up and put on my clothes, and went out across the yard
into the long stone passage, designing to gain the outer courtyard and
walk there for the relief of my mind. But I was no sooner in the passage
than I extinguished my candle; for I saw Miss Havisham going along it
in a ghostly manner, making a low cry. I followed her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) at a distance,
and saw her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) go up the staircase. She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) carried a bare candle in her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) hand,
which she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) had probably taken from one of the sconces in her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) own room,
and was a most unearthly object by its light. Standing at the bottom
of the staircase, I felt the mildewed air of the feast-chamber, without
seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) open the door, and I heard her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) walking there, and so across
into her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) own room, and so across again into that, never ceasing the low
cry. After a time, I tried in the dark both to get out, and to go back,
but I could do neither until some streaks of day strayed in and showed
me where to lay my hands. During the whole interval, whenever I went to
the bottom of the staircase, I heard her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) footstep, saw her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) light pass
above, and heard her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) ceaseless low cry.

<p/>Before we left next day, there was no revival of the difference between
her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) and Estella, nor was it ever revived on any similar occasion; and
there were four similar occasions, to the best of my remembrance. Nor,
did Miss Havisham's manner towards Estella in anywise change, except
that I believed it to have something like fear infused among its former
characteristics.

<p/>It is impossible to turn this leaf of my life, without putting Bentley
Drummle's name upon it; or I would, very gladly.

<p/>On a certain occasion when the Finches were assembled in force, and when
good feeling was being promoted in the usual manner by nobody's agreeing
with anybody else, the presiding Finch called the Grove to order,
forasmuch as Mr. Drummle had not yet toasted a lady; which, according
to the solemn constitution of the society, it was the brute's turn to
do that day. I thought I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Drummle</b></font>) leer in an ugly way at me while the
decanters were going round, but as there was no love lost between us,
that might easily be. What was my indignant surprise when he (<font color='blue'><b>Drummle</b></font>) called upon
the company to pledge him (<font color='blue'><b>Drummle</b></font>) to <div class="bookquote">``Estella!''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Estella who?''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Never you mind,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>retorted Drummle.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Estella of where?''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I. <div class="bookquote">``You are bound to say of where.''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>Which he (<font color='blue'><b>Drummle</b></font>)
was, as a Finch.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of Richmond, gentlemen,''  (<font color='red'><b>Drummle/Bentley Drummle/Mrs. Bentley Drummle</b></font>)</div>said Drummle, putting me out of the question,
<div class="bookquote">``and a peerless beauty.''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>Much he (<font color='blue'><b>Finch</b></font>) knew about peerless beauties, a mean, miserable idiot! I
whispered Herbert.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I know that lady,''  (<font color='red'><b>Herbert/Herbert Pocket</b></font>)</div>said Herbert, across the table, when the toast had
been honored.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Drummle/Bentley Drummle/Mrs. Bentley Drummle</b></font>)</div>said Drummle.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And so do I,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I added, with a scarlet face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Drummle/Bentley Drummle/Mrs. Bentley Drummle</b></font>)</div>said Drummle. <div class="bookquote">``O, Lord!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the creature</b></font>)</div><p/>This was the only retort--except glass or crockery--that the heavy
creature was capable of making; but, I became as highly incensed by it
as if it had been barbed with wit, and I immediately rose in my place
and said that I could not but regard it as being like the honorable
Finch's impudence to come down to that Grove,--we always talked
about coming down to that Grove, as a neat Parliamentary turn of
expression,--down to that Grove, proposing a lady of whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Grove</b></font>) knew
nothing. Mr. Drummle, upon this, starting up, demanded what I meant by
that? Whereupon I made him (<font color='blue'><b>Drummle</b></font>) the extreme reply that I believed he (<font color='blue'><b>Drummle</b></font>) knew
where I was to be found.

<p/>Whether it was possible in a Christian country to get on without blood,
after this, was a question on which the Finches were divided. The debate
upon it grew so lively, indeed, that at least six more honorable members
told six more, during the discussion, that they believed they knew where
they were to be found. However, it was decided at last -LRB-the Grove being
a Court of Honor-RRB- that if Mr. Drummle would bring never so slight
a certificate from the lady, importing that he (<font color='blue'><b>Drummle</b></font>) had the honor of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
acquaintance, Mr. Pip must express his (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) regret, as a gentleman and a
Finch, for <div class="bookquote">``having been betrayed into a warmth which.''  (<font color='red'><b>a Finch</b></font>)</div>Next day was
appointed for the production -LRB-lest our honor should take cold from
delay-RRB-, and next day Drummle appeared with a polite little avowal in
Estella's hand, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) had had the honor of dancing with him (<font color='blue'><b>Finch</b></font>) several
times. This left me no course but to regret that I had been <div class="bookquote">``betrayed
into a warmth which,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>and on the whole to repudiate, as untenable, the
idea that I was to be found anywhere. Drummle and I then sat snorting
at one another for an hour, while the Grove engaged in indiscriminate
contradiction, and finally the promotion of good feeling was declared to
have gone ahead at an amazing rate.

<p/>I tell this lightly, but it was no light thing to me. For, I cannot
adequately express what pain it gave me to think that Estella should
show any favor to a contemptible, clumsy, sulky booby, so very far below
the average. To the present moment, I believe it to have been referable
to some pure fire of generosity and disinterestedness in my love for
her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>), that I could not endure the thought of her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) stooping to that hound.
No doubt I should have been miserable whomsoever she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) had favored; but
a worthier object would have caused me a different kind and degree of
distress.

<p/>It was easy for me to find out, and I did soon find out, that Drummle
had begun to follow her (<font color='blue'><b>Drummle</b></font>) closely, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Drummle</b></font>) allowed him (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) to do it. A
little while, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) was always in pursuit of her (<font color='blue'><b>Drummle</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) and I crossed
one another every day. He (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) held on, in a dull persistent way, and Estella
held him (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) on; now with encouragement, now with discouragement, now almost
flattering him (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>), now openly despising him (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>), now knowing him (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) very well, now
scarcely remembering who he (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) was.

<p/>The Spider, as Mr. Jaggers had called him (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>), was used to lying in wait,
however, and had the patience of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) tribe. Added to that, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) had a
blockhead confidence in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) money and in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) family greatness,
which sometimes did him (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) good service,--almost taking the place of
concentration and determined purpose. So, the Spider, doggedly watching
Estella, outwatched many brighter insects, and would often uncoil
himself and drop at the right nick of time.

<p/>At a certain Assembly Ball at Richmond -LRB-there used to be Assembly Balls
at most places then-RRB-, where Estella had outshone all other beauties,
this blundering Drummle so hung about her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>), and with so much toleration
on her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) part, that I resolved to speak to her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) concerning him (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>). I took the
next opportunity; which was when she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) was waiting for Mrs. Blandley to
take her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) home, and was sitting apart among some flowers, ready to go.
I was with her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>), for I almost always accompanied them to and from such
places.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you tired, Estella?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Rather, Pip.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You should be.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Say rather, I should not be; for I have my letter to Satis House to
write, before I go to sleep.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Recounting to-night's triumph?''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I. <div class="bookquote">``Surely a very poor one,
Estella.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you mean? I didn't know there had been any.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Estella,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, <div class="bookquote">``do look at that fellow in the corner yonder, who is
looking over here at us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why should I look at him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Estella/Miss Estella/ESTELLA</b></font>)</div>returned Estella, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) eyes on me
instead. <div class="bookquote">``What is there in that fellow in the corner yonder,--to use
your words,--that I need look at?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed, that is the very question I want to ask you,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I. <div class="bookquote">``For he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)
has been hovering about you all night.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Moths, and all sorts of ugly creatures,''  (<font color='red'><b>Estella/Miss Estella/ESTELLA</b></font>)</div>replied Estella, with a glance
towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``hover about a lighted candle. Can the candle help it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I returned; <div class="bookquote">``but cannot the Estella help it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>), laughing, after a moment, <div class="bookquote">``perhaps. Yes. Anything you
like.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But, Estella, do hear me speak. It makes me wretched that you should
encourage a man so generally despised as Drummle. You know he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is
despised.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You know he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is as ungainly within as without. A deficient,
ill-tempered, lowering, stupid fellow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You know he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) has nothing to recommend him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) but money and a ridiculous
roll of addle-headed predecessors; now, don't you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) again; and each time she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) said it, she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) opened her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) lovely
eyes the wider.

<p/>To overcome the difficulty of getting past that monosyllable, I took it
from her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>), and said, repeating it with emphasis, <div class="bookquote">``Well! Then, that is why
it makes me wretched.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>Now, if I could have believed that she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) favored Drummle with any idea of
making me-me--wretched, I should have been in better heart about it;
but in that habitual way of hers, she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) put me so entirely out of the
question, that I could believe nothing of the kind.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Pip,''  (<font color='red'><b>Estella/Miss Estella/ESTELLA</b></font>)</div>said Estella, casting her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) glance over the room, <div class="bookquote">``don't be foolish
about its effect on you. It may have its effect on others, and may be
meant to have. It's not worth discussing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Estella/Miss Estella/ESTELLA</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes it is,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, ``because I cannot bear that people should say, `she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)
throws away her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) graces and attractions on a mere boor, the lowest in the
crowd.'''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can bear it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Estella/Miss Estella/ESTELLA</b></font>)</div>said Estella.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! don't be so proud, Estella, and so inflexible.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Calls me proud and inflexible in this breath!''  (<font color='red'><b>Estella/Miss Estella/ESTELLA</b></font>)</div>said Estella, opening
her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) hands. <div class="bookquote">``And in his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) last breath reproached me for stooping to a
boor!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There is no doubt you do,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, something hurriedly, <div class="bookquote">``for I have

give to--me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you want me then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Estella/Miss Estella/ESTELLA</b></font>)</div>said Estella, turning suddenly with a fixed and

 (<font color='red'><b>Estella/Miss Estella/ESTELLA</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you deceive and entrap him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), Estella?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, and many others,--all of them but you. Here is Mrs. Brandley. I'll

<p/>And now that I have given the one chapter to the theme that so filled my
heart, and so often made it ache and ache again, I pass on unhindered,
to the event that had impended over me longer yet; the event that had
begun to be prepared for, before I knew that the world held Estella,
and in the days when her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) baby intelligence was receiving its first
distortions from Miss Havisham's wasting hands.

<p/>In the Eastern story, the heavy slab that was to fall on the bed of
state in the flush of conquest was slowly wrought out of the quarry, the
tunnel for the rope to hold it in its place was slowly carried through
the leagues of rock, the slab was slowly raised and fitted in the roof,
the rope was rove to it and slowly taken through the miles of hollow to
the great iron ring. All being made ready with much labor, and the hour
come, the sultan was aroused in the dead of the night, and the sharpened
axe that was to sever the rope from the great iron ring was put into his (<font color='blue'><b>sultan</b></font>)
hand, and he (<font color='blue'><b>sultan</b></font>) struck with it, and the rope parted and rushed away, and
the ceiling fell. So, in my case; all the work, near and afar, that
tended to the end, had been accomplished; and in an instant the blow was
struck, and the roof of my stronghold dropped upon me.




<p/>Chapter XXXIX

<p/>I was three-and-twenty years of age. Not another word had I heard to
enlighten me on the subject of my expectations, and my twenty-third
birthday was a week gone. We had left Barnard's Inn more than a year,
and lived in the Temple. Our chambers were in Garden-court, down by the
river.

<p/>Mr. Pocket and I had for some time parted company as to our original
relations, though we continued on the best terms. Notwithstanding my
inability to settle to anything,--which I hope arose out of the restless
and incomplete tenure on which I held my means,--I had a taste for
reading, and read regularly so many hours a day. That matter of
Herbert's was still progressing, and everything with me was as I have
brought it down to the close of the last preceding chapter.

<p/>Business had taken Herbert on a journey to Marseilles. I was alone, and
had a dull sense of being alone. Dispirited and anxious, long hoping
that to-morrow or next week would clear my way, and long disappointed, I
sadly missed the cheerful face and ready response of my friend.

<p/>It was wretched weather; stormy and wet, stormy and wet; and mud, mud,
mud, deep in all the streets. Day after day, a vast heavy veil had been
driving over London from the East, and it drove still, as if in the East
there were an Eternity of cloud and wind. So furious had been the gusts,
that high buildings in town had had the lead stripped off their roofs;
and in the country, trees had been torn up, and sails of windmills
carried away; and gloomy accounts had come in from the coast, of
shipwreck and death. Violent blasts of rain had accompanied these rages
of wind, and the day just closed as I sat down to read had been the
worst of all.

<p/>Alterations have been made in that part of the Temple since that time,
and it has not now so lonely a character as it had then, nor is it so
exposed to the river. We lived at the top of the last house, and the
wind rushing up the river shook the house that night, like discharges
of cannon, or breakings of a sea. When the rain came with it and dashed
against the windows, I thought, raising my eyes to them as they
rocked, that I might have fancied myself in a storm-beaten lighthouse.
Occasionally, the smoke came rolling down the chimney as though it could
not bear to go out into such a night; and when I set the doors open and
looked down the staircase, the staircase lamps were blown out; and when
I shaded my face with my hands and looked through the black windows
-LRB-opening them ever so little was out of the question in the teeth of
such wind and rain-RRB-, I saw that the lamps in the court were blown out,
and that the lamps on the bridges and the shore were shuddering, and
that the coal-fires in barges on the river were being carried away
before the wind like red-hot splashes in the rain.

<p/>I read with my watch upon the table, purposing to close my book
at eleven o’clock. As I shut it, Saint Paul's, and all the many
church-clocks in the City--some leading, some accompanying, some
following--struck that hour. The sound was curiously flawed by the wind;
and I was listening, and thinking how the wind assailed and tore it,
when I heard a footstep on the stair.

<p/>What nervous folly made me start, and awfully connect it with the
footstep of my dead sister, matters not. It was past in a moment, and I
listened again, and heard the footstep stumble in coming on.
Remembering then, that the staircase-lights were blown out, I took up
my reading-lamp and went out to the stair-head. Whoever was below had
stopped on seeing my lamp, for all was quiet.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There is some one down there, is there not?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I called out, looking
down.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said a voice from the darkness beneath.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What floor do you want?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The top. Mr. Pip.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is my name.--There is nothing the matter?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing the matter,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>returned the voice. And the man came on.

<p/>I stood with my lamp held out over the stair-rail, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) came slowly
within its light. It was a shaded lamp, to shine upon a book, and its
circle of light was very contracted; so that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was in it for a mere
instant, and then out of it. In the instant, I had seen a face that was
strange to me, looking up with an incomprehensible air of being touched
and pleased by the sight of me.

<p/>Moving the lamp as the man moved, I made out that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was substantially
dressed, but roughly, like a voyager by sea. That he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had long iron-gray
hair. That his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) age was about sixty. That he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was a muscular man, strong
on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) legs, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was browned and hardened by exposure to
weather. As he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ascended the last stair or two, and the light of my lamp
included us both, I saw, with a stupid kind of amazement, that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was
holding out both his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hands to me.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Pray what is your business?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My business?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) repeated, pausing. <div class="bookquote">``Ah! Yes. I will explain my
business, by your leave.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you wish to come in?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) replied; <div class="bookquote">``I wish to come in, master.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>I had asked him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) the question inhospitably enough, for I resented the
sort of bright and gratified recognition that still shone in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face.
I resented it, because it seemed to imply that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) expected me to respond
to it. But I took him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) into the room I had just left, and, having set the
lamp on the table, asked him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) as civilly as I could to explain himself.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) looked about him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) with the strangest air,--an air of wondering
pleasure, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had some part in the things he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) admired,--and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
pulled off a rough outer coat, and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hat. Then, I saw that his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head
was furrowed and bald, and that the long iron-gray hair grew only on
its sides. But, I saw nothing that in the least explained him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). On the
contrary, I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) next moment, once more holding out both his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hands to
me.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you mean?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, half suspecting him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to be mad.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stopped in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) looking at me, and slowly rubbed his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) right hand over
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``It's disapinting to a man,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said, in a coarse broken
voice, <div class="bookquote">``arter having looked for'ard so distant, and come so fur; but
you're not to blame for that,--neither on us is to blame for that. I'll
speak in half a minute. Give me half a minute, please.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sat down on a chair that stood before the fire, and covered his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
forehead with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) large brown veinous hands. I looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) attentively
then, and recoiled a little from him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>); but I did not know him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There's no one nigh,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), looking over his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shoulder; <div class="bookquote">``is there?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why do you, a stranger coming into my rooms at this time of the night,
ask that question?''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You're a game one,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) returned, shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head at me with a
deliberate affection, at once most unintelligible and most exasperating;
<div class="bookquote">``I'm glad you've grow'd up, a game one! But don't catch hold of me.
You'd be sorry arterwards to have done it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>I relinquished the intention he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had detected, for I knew him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)! Even yet
I could not recall a single feature, but I knew him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)! If the wind and
the rain had driven away the intervening years, had scattered all the
intervening objects, had swept us to the churchyard where we first stood
face to face on such different levels, I could not have known my convict
more distinctly than I knew him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) now as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sat in the chair before the
fire. No need to take a file from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pocket and show it to me; no need
to take the handkerchief from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) neck and twist it round his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head; no
need to hug himself with both his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) arms, and take a shivering turn across
the room, looking back at me for recognition. I knew him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) before he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) gave
me one of those aids, though, a moment before, I had not been conscious
of remotely suspecting his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) identity.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) came back to where I stood, and again held out both his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hands.
Not knowing what to do,--for, in my astonishment I had lost my
self-possession,--I reluctantly gave him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) my hands. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) grasped them
heartily, raised them to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lips, kissed them, and still held them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You acted noble, my boy,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Noble, Pip! And I have never forgot
it!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>At a change in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) manner as if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) were even going to embrace me, I laid
a hand upon his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) breast and put him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) away.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Stay!''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I. <div class="bookquote">``Keep off! If you are grateful to me for what I did when
I was a little child, I hope you have shown your gratitude by mending
your way of life. If you have come here to thank me, it was not
necessary. Still, however you have found me out, there must be something
good in the feeling that has brought you here, and I will not repulse
you; but surely you must understand that--I--''

 (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div><p/>My attention was so attracted by the singularity of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fixed look at
me, that the words died away on my tongue.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You was a saying,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) observed, when we had confronted one another
in silence, <div class="bookquote">``that surely I must understand. What, surely must I
understand?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That I cannot wish to renew that chance intercourse with you of long
ago, under these different circumstances. I am glad to believe you have
repented and recovered yourself. I am glad to tell you so. I am glad
that, thinking I deserve to be thanked, you have come to thank me. But
our ways are different ways, none the less. You are wet, and you look
weary. Will you drink something before you go?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had replaced his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) neckerchief loosely, and had stood, keenly observant
of me, biting a long end of it. <div class="bookquote">``I think,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) answered, still with the
end at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mouth and still observant of me, <div class="bookquote">``that I will drink -LRB-I thank
you-RRB- afore I go.''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>There was a tray ready on a side-table. I brought it to the table
near the fire, and asked him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would have? He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) touched one of the
bottles without looking at it or speaking, and I made him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) some hot rum
and water. I tried to keep my hand steady while I did so, but his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) look
at me as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) leaned back in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) chair with the long draggled end of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
neckerchief between his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) teeth--evidently forgotten--made my hand very
difficult to master. When at last I put the glass to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), I saw with
amazement that his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes were full of tears.

<p/>Up to this time I had remained standing, not to disguise that I wished
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) gone. But I was softened by the softened aspect of the man, and felt
a touch of reproach. <div class="bookquote">``I hope,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, hurriedly putting something into
a glass for myself, and drawing a chair to the table, <div class="bookquote">``that you will not
think I spoke harshly to you just now. I had no intention of doing it,
and I am sorry for it if I did. I wish you well and happy!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>As I put my glass to my lips, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) glanced with surprise at the end of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
neckerchief, dropping from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mouth when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) opened it, and stretched
out his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand. I gave him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mine, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) drank, and drew his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sleeve
across his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes and forehead.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How are you living?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've been a sheep-farmer, stock-breeder, other trades besides, away in
the new world,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``many a thousand mile of stormy water off from
this.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope you have done well?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I've done wonderfully well. There's others went out alonger me as has
done well too, but no man has done nigh as well as me. I'm famous for
it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am glad to hear it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope to hear you say so, my dear boy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Without stopping to try to understand those words or the tone in which
they were spoken, I turned off to a point that had just come into my
mind.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you ever seen a messenger you once sent to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I inquired, <div class="bookquote">``since
he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) undertook that trust?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never set eyes upon him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>). I warn't likely to it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) came faithfully, and he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) brought me the two one-pound notes. I was
a poor boy then, as you know, and to a poor boy they were a little
fortune. But, like you, I have done well since, and you must let me pay
them back. You can put them to some other poor boy's use.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I took out my
purse.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) watched me as I laid my purse upon the table and opened it, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
watched me as I separated two one-pound notes from its contents. They
were clean and new, and I spread them out and handed them over to
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). Still watching me, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) laid them one upon the other, folded them
long-wise, gave them a twist, set fire to them at the lamp, and dropped
the ashes into the tray.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``May I make so bold,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said then, with a smile that was like a frown,
and with a frown that was like a smile, <div class="bookquote">``as ask you how you have done
well, since you and me was out on them lone shivering marshes?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) emptied his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) glass, got up, and stood at the side of the fire, with
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) heavy brown hand on the mantel-shelf. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) put a foot up to the bars,
to dry and warm it, and the wet boot began to steam; but, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) neither
looked at it, nor at the fire, but steadily looked at me. It was only
now that I began to tremble.

<p/>When my lips had parted, and had shaped some words that were
without sound, I forced myself to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) -LRB-though I could not do it
distinctly-RRB-, that I had been chosen to succeed to some property.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Might a mere warmint ask what property?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).

<p/>I faltered, <div class="bookquote">``I don't know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Might a mere warmint ask whose property?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).

<p/>I faltered again, <div class="bookquote">``I don't know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Could I make a guess, I wonder,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the Convict, <div class="bookquote">``at your income
since you come of age! As to the first figure now. Five?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>With my heart beating like a heavy hammer of disordered action, I rose
out of my chair, and stood with my hand upon the back of it, looking
wildly at him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Concerning a guardian,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) went on. <div class="bookquote">``There ought to have been some
guardian, or such-like, whiles you was a minor. Some lawyer, maybe. As
to the first letter of that lawyer's name now. Would it be J?''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>All the truth of my position came flashing on me; and its
disappointments, dangers, disgraces, consequences of all kinds, rushed
in in such a multitude that I was borne down by them and had to struggle
for every breath I drew.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Put it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) resumed, <div class="bookquote">``as the employer of that lawyer whose name begun
with a J, and might be Jaggers,--put it as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) had come over sea to
Portsmouth, and had landed there, and had wanted to come on to you.
`However, you have found me out,' you says just now. Well! However, did
I find you out? Why, I wrote from Portsmouth to a person in London, for
particulars of your address. That person's name? Why, Wemmick.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>I could not have spoken one word, though it had been to save my life.
I stood, with a hand on the chair-back and a hand on my breast, where
I seemed to be suffocating,--I stood so, looking wildly at him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), until I
grasped at the chair, when the room began to surge and turn. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) caught
me, drew me to the sofa, put me up against the cushions, and bent on one
knee before me, bringing the face that I now well remembered, and that I
shuddered at, very near to mine.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Pip, dear boy, I've made a gentleman on you! It's me wot has
done it! I swore that time, sure as ever I earned a guinea, that guinea
should go to you. I swore arterwards, sure as ever I spec'lated and got
rich, you should get rich. I lived rough, that you should live smooth;
I worked hard, that you should be above work. What odds, dear boy? Do I
tell it, fur you to feel a obligation? Not a bit. I tell it, fur you to
know as that there hunted dunghill dog wot you kep life in, got his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) head
so high that he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) could make a gentleman,--and, Pip, you're him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>The abhorrence in which I held the man, the dread I had of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), the
repugnance with which I shrank from him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), could not have been exceeded if
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had been some terrible beast.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Look'ee here, Pip. I'm your second father. You're my son,--more to me
nor any son. I've put away money, only for you to spend. When I was a
hired-out shepherd in a solitary hut, not seeing no faces but faces of
sheep till I half forgot wot men's and women's faces wos like, I see
yourn. I drops my knife many a time in that hut when I was a-eating my
dinner or my supper, and I says, `Here's the boy again, a looking at
me whiles I eats and drinks!' I see you there a many times, as plain as
ever I see you on them misty marshes. `Lord strike me dead!' I says each
time,--and I goes out in the air to say it under the open heavens,--`but
wot, if I gets liberty and money, I'll make that boy a gentleman!' And
I done it. Why, look at you, dear boy! Look at these here lodgings
o’yourn, fit for a lord! A lord? Ah! You shall show money with lords for
wagers, and beat `em!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>In his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) heat and triumph, and in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knowledge that I had been nearly
fainting, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did not remark on my reception of all this. It was the one
grain of relief I had.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Look'ee here!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) went on, taking my watch out of my pocket, and
turning towards him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) a ring on my finger, while I recoiled from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
touch as if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had been a snake, <div class="bookquote">``a gold `un and a beauty: that's a
gentleman's, I hope! A diamond all set round with rubies; that's a
gentleman's, I hope! Look at your linen; fine and beautiful! Look at
your clothes; better ain't to be got! And your books too,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>turning his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
eyes round the room, <div class="bookquote">``mounting up, on their shelves, by hundreds! And
you read `em; don't you? I see you'd been a reading of `em when I come
in. Ha, ha, ha! You shall read `em to me, dear boy! And if they're in
foreign languages wot I don't understand, I shall be just as proud as if
I did.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Again he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) took both my hands and put them to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lips, while my blood ran
cold within me.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't you mind talking, Pip,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), after again drawing his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sleeve
over his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes and forehead, as the click came in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) throat which I well
remembered,--and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was all the more horrible to me that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was so much
in earnest; <div class="bookquote">``you can't do better nor keep quiet, dear boy. You ain't
looked slowly forward to this as I have; you wosn't prepared for this as
I wos. But didn't you never think it might be me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``O no, no, no,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I returned, <div class="bookquote">``Never, never!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, you see it wos me, and single-handed. Never a soul in it but my
own self and Mr. Jaggers.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Was there no one else?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), with a glance of surprise: <div class="bookquote">``who else should there be?
And, dear boy, how good looking you have growed! There's bright eyes
somewheres--eh? Isn't there bright eyes somewheres, wot you love the
thoughts on?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>O Estella, Estella!

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They shall be yourn, dear boy, if money can buy `em. Not that a
gentleman like you, so well set up as you, can't win `em off of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) own
game; but money shall back you! Let me finish wot I was a telling you,
dear boy. From that there hut and that there hiring-out, I got money
left me by my master -LRB-which died, and had been the same as me-RRB-, and got
my liberty and went for myself. In every single thing I went for, I went
for you. `Lord strike a blight upon it,' I says, wotever it was I went
for, `if it ain't for him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>)!' It all prospered wonderful. As I giv' you
to understand just now, I'm famous for it. It was the money left me, and
the gains of the first few year wot I sent home to Mr. Jaggers--all for
you--when he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) first come arter you, agreeable to my letter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>O that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had never come! That he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had left me at the forge,--far from
contented, yet, by comparison happy!

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And then, dear boy, it was a recompense to me, look'ee here, to know in
secret that I was making a gentleman. The blood horses of them colonists
might fling up the dust over me as I was walking; what do I say? I says
to myself, `I'm making a better gentleman nor ever you'll be!' When
one of `em says to another, `He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was a convict, a few year ago, and is a
ignorant common fellow now, for all he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)'s lucky,' what do I say? I says
to myself, `If I ain't a gentleman, nor yet ain't got no learning, I'm
the owner of such. All on you owns stock and land; which on you owns a
brought-up London gentleman?' This way I kep myself a going. And this
way I held steady afore my mind that I would for certain come one day
and see my boy, and make myself known to him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), on his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) own ground.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) laid his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand on my shoulder. I shuddered at the thought that for
anything I knew, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand might be stained with blood.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It warn't easy, Pip, for me to leave them parts, nor yet it warn't
safe. But I held to it, and the harder it was, the stronger I held, for
I was determined, and my mind firm made up. At last I done it. Dear boy,
I done it!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I tried to collect my thoughts, but I was stunned. Throughout, I had
seemed to myself to attend more to the wind and the rain than to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>);
even now, I could not separate his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) voice from those voices, though those
were loud and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was silent.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where will you put me?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) asked, presently. <div class="bookquote">``I must be put somewheres,
dear boy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To sleep?''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. And to sleep long and sound,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) answered; <div class="bookquote">``for I've been
sea-tossed and sea-washed, months and months.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My friend and companion,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, rising from the sofa, <div class="bookquote">``is absent; you
must have his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) room.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) won't come back to-morrow; will he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, answering almost mechanically, in spite of my utmost
efforts; <div class="bookquote">``not to-morrow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because, look'ee here, dear boy,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said, dropping his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) voice, and
laying a long finger on my breast in an impressive manner, <div class="bookquote">``caution is
necessary.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How do you mean? Caution?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``By G--, it's Death!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What's death?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I was sent for life. It's death to come back. There's been overmuch
coming back of late years, and I should of a certainty be hanged if
took.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Nothing was needed but this; the wretched man, after loading wretched me
with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) gold and silver chains for years, had risked his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) life to come
to me, and I held it there in my keeping! If I had loved him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) instead
of abhorring him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>); if I had been attracted to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) by the strongest
admiration and affection, instead of shrinking from him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) with the
strongest repugnance; it could have been no worse. On the contrary, it
would have been better, for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) preservation would then have naturally
and tenderly addressed my heart.

<p/>My first care was to close the shutters, so that no light might be seen
from without, and then to close and make fast the doors. While I did so,
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stood at the table drinking rum and eating biscuit; and when I saw
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thus engaged, I saw my convict on the marshes at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) meal again. It
almost seemed to me as if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) must stoop down presently, to file at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
leg.

<p/>When I had gone into Herbert's room, and had shut off any other
communication between it and the staircase than through the room in
which our conversation had been held, I asked him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would go to bed?
He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said yes, but asked me for some of my <div class="bookquote">``gentleman's linen''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>to put
on in the morning. I brought it out, and laid it ready for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and my
blood again ran cold when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) again took me by both hands to give me good
night.

<p/>I got away from him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), without knowing how I did it, and mended the fire
in the room where we had been together, and sat down by it, afraid to go
to bed. For an hour or more, I remained too stunned to think; and it
was not until I began to think, that I began fully to know how wrecked I
was, and how the ship in which I had sailed was gone to pieces.

<p/>Miss Havisham's intentions towards me, all a mere dream; Estella not
designed for me; I only suffered in Satis House as a convenience, a
sting for the greedy relations, a model with a mechanical heart to
practise on when no other practice was at hand; those were the first
smarts I had. But, sharpest and deepest pain of all,--it was for the
convict, guilty of I knew not what crimes, and liable to be taken out
of those rooms where I sat thinking, and hanged at the Old Bailey door,
that I had deserted Joe.

<p/>I would not have gone back to Joe now, I would not have gone back to
Biddy now, for any consideration; simply, I suppose, because my sense of
my own worthless conduct to them was greater than every consideration.
No wisdom on earth could have given me the comfort that I should have
derived from their simplicity and fidelity; but I could never, never,
undo what I had done.

<p/>In every rage of wind and rush of rain, I heard pursuers. Twice, I could
have sworn there was a knocking and whispering at the outer door. With
these fears upon me, I began either to imagine or recall that I had had
mysterious warnings of this man's approach. That, for weeks gone by, I
had passed faces in the streets which I had thought like his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). That these
likenesses had grown more numerous, as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), coming over the sea, had
drawn nearer. That his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wicked spirit had somehow sent these messengers
to mine, and that now on this stormy night he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was as good as his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) word,
and with me.

<p/>Crowding up with these reflections came the reflection that I had seen
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) with my childish eyes to be a desperately violent man; that I had
heard that other convict reiterate that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had tried to murder him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>); that
I had seen him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) down in the ditch tearing and fighting like a wild
beast. Out of such remembrances I brought into the light of the fire a
half-formed terror that it might not be safe to be shut up there with
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in the dead of the wild solitary night. This dilated until it filled
the room, and impelled me to take a candle and go in and look at my
dreadful burden.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had rolled a handkerchief round his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head, and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face was set and
lowering in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sleep. But he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was asleep, and quietly too, though he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had
a pistol lying on the pillow. Assured of this, I softly removed the key
to the outside of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) door, and turned it on him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) before I again sat down
by the fire. Gradually I slipped from the chair and lay on the floor.
When I awoke without having parted in my sleep with the perception of
my wretchedness, the clocks of the Eastward churches were striking five,
the candles were wasted out, the fire was dead, and the wind and rain
intensified the thick black darkness.

<p/>THIS IS THE END OF THE SECOND STAGE OF PIP'S EXPECTATIONS.




<p/>Chapter XL

<p/>It was fortunate for me that I had to take precautions to ensure -LRB-so far
as I could-RRB- the safety of my dreaded visitor; for, this thought pressing
on me when I awoke, held other thoughts in a confused concourse at a
distance.

<p/>The impossibility of keeping him (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) concealed in the chambers was
self-evident. It could not be done, and the attempt to do it would
inevitably engender suspicion. True, I had no Avenger in my service now,
but I was looked after by an inflammatory old female, assisted by an
animated rag-bag whom she (<font color='blue'><b>female</b></font>) called her (<font color='blue'><b>female</b></font>) niece, and to keep a room secret
from them would be to invite curiosity and exaggeration. They both had
weak eyes, which I had long attributed to their chronically looking in
at keyholes, and they were always at hand when not wanted; indeed that
was their only reliable quality besides larceny. Not to get up a mystery
with these people, I resolved to announce in the morning that my uncle
had unexpectedly come from the country.

<p/>This course I decided on while I was yet groping about in the darkness
for the means of getting a light. Not stumbling on the means after all,
I was fain to go out to the adjacent Lodge and get the watchman there to
come with his (<font color='blue'><b>watchman</b></font>) lantern. Now, in groping my way down the black staircase I
fell over something, and that something was a man crouching in a corner.

<p/>As the man made no answer when I asked him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did there, but eluded
my touch in silence, I ran to the Lodge and urged the watchman to come
quickly; telling him (<font color='blue'><b>watchman</b></font>) of the incident on the way back. The wind being as
fierce as ever, we did not care to endanger the light in the lantern by
rekindling the extinguished lamps on the staircase, but we examined the
staircase from the bottom to the top and found no one there. It then
occurred to me as possible that the man might have slipped into my
rooms; so, lighting my candle at the watchman's, and leaving him (<font color='blue'><b>watchman</b></font>)
standing at the door, I examined them carefully, including the room in
which my dreaded guest lay asleep. All was quiet, and assuredly no other
man was in those chambers.

<p/>It troubled me that there should have been a lurker on the stairs, on
that night of all nights in the year, and I asked the watchman, on the
chance of eliciting some hopeful explanation as I handed him (<font color='blue'><b>watchman</b></font>) a dram
at the door, whether he (<font color='blue'><b>watchman</b></font>) had admitted at his (<font color='blue'><b>watchman</b></font>) gate any gentleman who had
perceptibly been dining out? Yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>watchman</b></font>) said; at different times of the
night, three. One lived in Fountain Court, and the other two lived in
the Lane, and he (<font color='blue'><b>watchman</b></font>) had seen them all go home. Again, the only other man
who dwelt in the house of which my chambers formed a part had been in
the country for some weeks, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) certainly had not returned in the
night, because we had seen his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) door with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) seal on it as we came
upstairs.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The night being so bad, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>the watchman</b></font>)</div>said the watchman, as he (<font color='blue'><b>watchman</b></font>) gave me back
my glass, <div class="bookquote">``uncommon few have come in at my gate. Besides them three
gentlemen that I have named, I don't call to mind another since about
eleven o’clock, when a stranger asked for you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My uncle,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I muttered. <div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You saw him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>), sir?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. Oh yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Likewise the person with him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Person with him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I repeated.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I judged the person to be with him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>the watchman</b></font>)</div>returned the watchman. <div class="bookquote">``The person
stopped, when he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) stopped to make inquiry of me, and the person took this
way when he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) took this way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What sort of person?''

 (<font color='red'><b>The watchman</b></font>)</div><p/>The watchman had not particularly noticed; he (<font color='blue'><b>watchman</b></font>) should say a working
person; to the best of his (<font color='blue'><b>watchman</b></font>) belief, he (<font color='blue'><b>watchman</b></font>) had a dust-colored kind of clothes
on, under a dark coat. The watchman made more light of the matter than I
did, and naturally; not having my reason for attaching weight to it.

<p/>When I had got rid of him (<font color='blue'><b>watchman</b></font>), which I thought it well to do without
prolonging explanations, my mind was much troubled by these two
circumstances taken together. Whereas they were easy of innocent
solution apart,--as, for instance, some diner out or diner at home,
who had not gone near this watchman's gate, might have strayed to my
staircase and dropped asleep there,--and my nameless visitor might have
brought some one with him (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) to show him (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) the way,--still, joined, they had
an ugly look to one as prone to distrust and fear as the changes of a
few hours had made me.

<p/>I lighted my fire, which burnt with a raw pale flare at that time of the
morning, and fell into a doze before it. I seemed to have been dozing a
whole night when the clocks struck six. As there was full an hour and
a half between me and daylight, I dozed again; now, waking up uneasily,
with prolix conversations about nothing, in my ears; now, making thunder
of the wind in the chimney; at length, falling off into a profound sleep
from which the daylight woke me with a start.

<p/>All this time I had never been able to consider my own situation, nor
could I do so yet. I had not the power to attend to it. I was greatly
dejected and distressed, but in an incoherent wholesale sort of way.
As to forming any plan for the future, I could as soon have formed an
elephant. When I opened the shutters and looked out at the wet wild
morning, all of a leaden hue; when I walked from room to room; when I
sat down again shivering, before the fire, waiting for my laundress to
appear; I thought how miserable I was, but hardly knew why, or how long
I had been so, or on what day of the week I made the reflection, or even
who I was that made it.

<p/>At last, the old woman and the niece came in,--the latter with a head
not easily distinguishable from her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) dusty broom,--and testified surprise
at sight of me and the fire. To whom I imparted how my uncle had come in
the night and was then asleep, and how the breakfast preparations were
to be modified accordingly. Then I washed and dressed while they knocked
the furniture about and made a dust; and so, in a sort of dream
or sleep-waking, I found myself sitting by the fire again, waiting
for--Him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>)--to come to breakfast.

<p/>By and by, his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) door opened and he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) came out. I could not bring myself to
bear the sight of him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>), and I thought he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) had a worse look by daylight.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not even know,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, speaking low as he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) seat at the
table, <div class="bookquote">``by what name to call you. I have given out that you are my
uncle.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's it, dear boy! Call me uncle.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You assumed some name, I suppose, on board ship?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, dear boy. I took the name of Provis.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you mean to keep that name?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, yes, dear boy, it's as good as another,--unless you'd like
another.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What is your real name?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) in a whisper.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Magwitch,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) answered, in the same tone; <div class="bookquote">``chrisen'd Abel.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What were you brought up to be?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A warmint, dear boy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) answered quite seriously, and used the word as if it denoted some
profession.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``When you came into the Temple last night--''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, pausing to wonder
whether that could really have been last night, which seemed so long
ago.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, dear boy?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``When you came in at the gate and asked the watchman the way here, had
you any one with you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``With me? No, dear boy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But there was some one there?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I didn't take particular notice,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) said, dubiously, <div class="bookquote">``not knowing the
ways of the place. But I think there was a person, too, come in alonger
me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you known in London?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope not!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>), giving his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) neck a jerk with his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) forefinger that
made me turn hot and sick.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Were you known in London, once?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not over and above, dear boy. I was in the provinces mostly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Were you--tried--in London?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Which time?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>), with a sharp look.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The last time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) nodded. <div class="bookquote">``First knowed Mr. Jaggers that way. Jaggers was for me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>It was on my lips to ask him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) what he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) was tried for, but he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) took up
a knife, gave it a flourish, and with the words, <div class="bookquote">``And what I done is
worked out and paid for!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>fell to at his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) breakfast.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) ate in a ravenous way that was very disagreeable, and all his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) actions
were uncouth, noisy, and greedy. Some of his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) teeth had failed him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) since
I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) eat on the marshes, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) turned his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) food in his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) mouth,
and turned his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) head sideways to bring his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) strongest fangs to bear upon
it, he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) looked terribly like a hungry old dog. If I had begun with any
appetite, he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) would have taken it away, and I should have sat much as
I did,--repelled from him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) by an insurmountable aversion, and gloomily
looking at the cloth.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm a heavy grubber, dear boy,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) said, as a polite kind of apology
when he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) made an end of his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) meal, <div class="bookquote">``but I always was. If it had been in
my constitution to be a lighter grubber, I might ha' got into lighter
trouble. Similarly, I must have my smoke. When I was first hired out as
shepherd t'other side the world, it's my belief I should ha' turned into
a molloncolly-mad sheep myself, if I hadn't a had my smoke.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) said so, he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) got up from table, and putting his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) hand into the
breast of the pea-coat he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) wore, brought out a short black pipe, and a
handful of loose tobacco of the kind that is called Negro-head. Having
filled his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) pipe, he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) put the surplus tobacco back again, as if his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) pocket
were a drawer. Then, he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) took a live coal from the fire with the tongs,
and lighted his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) pipe at it, and then turned round on the hearth-rug with
his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) back to the fire, and went through his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) favorite action of holding
out both his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) hands for mine.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And this,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>), dandling my hands up and down in his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>), as he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) puffed
at his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) pipe,--<div class="bookquote">``and this is the gentleman what I made! The real genuine
One! It does me good fur to look at you, Pip. All I stip'late, is, to
stand by and look at you, dear boy!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>I released my hands as soon as I could, and found that I was beginning
slowly to settle down to the contemplation of my condition. What I was
chained to, and how heavily, became intelligible to me, as I heard his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>)
hoarse voice, and sat looking up at his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) furrowed bald head with its iron
gray hair at the sides.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I mustn't see my gentleman a footing it in the mire of the streets;
there mustn't be no mud on his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) boots. My gentleman must have horses,
Pip! Horses to ride, and horses to drive, and horses for his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) servant
to ride and drive as well. Shall colonists have their horses -LRB-and blood
`uns, if you please, good Lord!-RRB- and not my London gentleman? No, no.
We'll show `em another pair of shoes than that, Pip; won't us?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) took out of his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) pocket a great thick pocket-book, bursting with
papers, and tossed it on the table.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There's something worth spending in that there book, dear boy. It's
yourn. All I've got ain't mine; it's yourn. Don't you be afeerd on it.
There's more where that come from. I've come to the old country fur
to see my gentleman spend his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) money like a gentleman. That'll be my
pleasure. My pleasure `ull be fur to see him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) do it. And blast you all!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) wound up, looking round the room and snapping his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) fingers once with
a loud snap, <div class="bookquote">``blast you every one, from the judge in his (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) wig, to the
colonist a stirring up the dust, I'll show a better gentleman than the
whole kit on you put together!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Stop!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, almost in a frenzy of fear and dislike, <div class="bookquote">``I want to speak
to you. I want to know what is to be done. I want to know how you are to
be kept out of danger, how long you are going to stay, what projects you
have.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Look'ee here, Pip,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>), laying his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) hand on my arm in a suddenly
altered and subdued manner; <div class="bookquote">``first of all, look'ee here. I forgot myself
half a minute ago. What I said was low; that's what it was; low. Look'ee
here, Pip. Look over it. I ain't a going to be low.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``First,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I resumed, half groaning, <div class="bookquote">``what precautions can be taken
against your being recognized and seized?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, dear boy,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) said, in the same tone as before, <div class="bookquote">``that don't
go first. Lowness goes first. I ain't took so many year to make a
gentleman, not without knowing what's due to him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>). Look'ee here, Pip. I
was low; that's what I was; low. Look over it, dear boy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Some sense of the grimly-ludicrous moved me to a fretful laugh, as I
replied, <div class="bookquote">``I have looked over it. In Heaven's name, don't harp upon it!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, but look'ee here,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) persisted. <div class="bookquote">``Dear boy, I ain't come so fur,
not fur to be low. Now, go on, dear boy. You was a saying--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How are you to be guarded from the danger you have incurred?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, dear boy, the danger ain't so great. Without I was informed
agen, the danger ain't so much to signify. There's Jaggers, and there's
Wemmick, and there's you. Who else is there to inform?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is there no chance person who might identify you in the street?''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said
I.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) returned, <div class="bookquote">``there ain't many. Nor yet I don't intend to
advertise myself in the newspapers by the name of A.M. come back from
Botany Bay; and years have rolled away, and who's to gain by it? Still,
look'ee here, Pip. If the danger had been fifty times as great, I should
ha' come to see you, mind you, just the same.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And how long do you remain?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How long?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>), taking his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) black pipe from his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) mouth, and dropping
his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) jaw as he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) stared at me. <div class="bookquote">``I'm not a going back. I've come for good.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Where are you to live?''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I. <div class="bookquote">``What is to be done with you? Where
will you be safe?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear boy,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) returned, <div class="bookquote">``there's disguising wigs can be bought
for money, and there's hair powder, and spectacles, and black
clothes,--shorts and what not. Others has done it safe afore, and what
others has done afore, others can do agen. As to the where and how of
living, dear boy, give me your own opinions on it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You take it smoothly now,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, <div class="bookquote">``but you were very serious last
night, when you swore it was Death.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And so I swear it is Death,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>), putting his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) pipe back in his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>)
mouth, <div class="bookquote">``and Death by the rope, in the open street not fur from this, and
it's serious that you should fully understand it to be so. What then,
when that's once done? Here I am. To go back now `ud be as bad as to
stand ground--worse. Besides, Pip, I'm here, because I've meant it by
you, years and years. As to what I dare, I'm a old bird now, as has
dared all manner of traps since first he (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) was fledged, and I'm not afeerd
to perch upon a scarecrow. If there's Death hid inside of it, there is,
and let him (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) come out, and I'll face him (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>), and then I'll believe in him (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>)
and not afore. And now let me have a look at my gentleman agen.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Once more, he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) took me by both hands and surveyed me with an air of
admiring proprietorship: smoking with great complacency all the while.

<p/>It appeared to me that I could do no better than secure him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) some
quiet lodging hard by, of which he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) might take possession when Herbert
returned: whom I expected in two or three days. That the secret must
be confided to Herbert as a matter of unavoidable necessity, even if I
could have put the immense relief I should derive from sharing it with
him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) out of the question, was plain to me. But it was by no means so
plain to Mr. Provis -LRB-I resolved to call him (<font color='blue'><b>Provis</b></font>) by that name-RRB-, who reserved
his (<font color='blue'><b>Provis</b></font>) consent to Herbert's participation until he (<font color='blue'><b>Provis</b></font>) should have seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Provis</b></font>)
and formed a favorable judgment of his (<font color='blue'><b>Provis</b></font>) physiognomy. <div class="bookquote">``And even then, dear
boy,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Provis</b></font>), pulling a greasy little clasped black Testament out of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Provis</b></font>) pocket, <div class="bookquote">``we'll have him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) on his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) oath.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>To state that my terrible patron carried this little black book about
the world solely to swear people on in cases of emergency, would be to
state what I never quite established; but this I can say, that I never
knew him (<font color='blue'><b>Provis</b></font>) put it to any other use. The book itself had the appearance of
having been stolen from some court of justice, and perhaps his (<font color='blue'><b>Provis</b></font>) knowledge
of its antecedents, combined with his (<font color='blue'><b>Provis</b></font>) own experience in that wise, gave
him (<font color='blue'><b>Provis</b></font>) a reliance on its powers as a sort of legal spell or charm. On this
first occasion of his (<font color='blue'><b>Provis</b></font>) producing it, I recalled how he (<font color='blue'><b>Provis</b></font>) had made me swear
fidelity in the churchyard long ago, and how he (<font color='blue'><b>Provis</b></font>) had described himself
last night as always swearing to his (<font color='blue'><b>Provis</b></font>) resolutions in his (<font color='blue'><b>Provis</b></font>) solitude.

<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Provis</b></font>) was at present dressed in a seafaring slop suit, in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Provis</b></font>)
looked as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Provis</b></font>) had some parrots and cigars to dispose of, I next
discussed with him (<font color='blue'><b>Provis</b></font>) what dress he (<font color='blue'><b>Provis</b></font>) should wear. He (<font color='blue'><b>Provis</b></font>) cherished an
extraordinary belief in the virtues of <div class="bookquote">``shorts''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>as a disguise, and had
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Provis</b></font>) own mind sketched a dress for himself that would have made
him (<font color='blue'><b>Provis</b></font>) something between a dean and a dentist. It was with considerable
difficulty that I won him (<font color='blue'><b>Provis</b></font>) over to the assumption of a dress more like a
prosperous farmer's; and we arranged that he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) should cut his (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) hair close,
and wear a little powder. Lastly, as he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) had not yet been seen by the
laundress or her (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) niece, he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) was to keep himself out of their view until
his (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) change of dress was made.

<p/>It would seem a simple matter to decide on these precautions; but in my
dazed, not to say distracted, state, it took so long, that I did not
get out to further them until two or three in the afternoon. He (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) was to
remain shut up in the chambers while I was gone, and was on no account
to open the door.

<p/>There being to my knowledge a respectable lodging-house in Essex Street,
the back of which looked into the Temple, and was almost within hail of
my windows, I first of all repaired to that house, and was so fortunate
as to secure the second floor for my uncle, Mr. Provis. I then went from
shop to shop, making such purchases as were necessary to the change in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Provis</b></font>) appearance. This business transacted, I turned my face, on my own
account, to Little Britain. Mr. Jaggers was at his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) desk, but, seeing me
enter, got up immediately and stood before his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) fire.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, Pip,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``be careful.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I returned. For, coming along I had thought well of what
I was going to say.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't commit yourself,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jaggers/Jaggers/MR. JAGGERS</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Jaggers, <div class="bookquote">``and don't commit any one.
You understand--any one. Don't tell me anything: I don't want to know
anything; I am not curious.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jaggers/Jaggers/MR. JAGGERS</b></font>)</div><p/>Of course I saw that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) knew the man was come.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I merely want, Mr. Jaggers,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, <div class="bookquote">``to assure myself that what I have
been told is true. I have no hope of its being untrue, but at least I
may verify it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Jaggers nodded. <div class="bookquote">``But did you say `told' or `informed'?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) asked
me, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) head on one side, and not looking at me, but looking in
a listening way at the floor. <div class="bookquote">``Told would seem to imply verbal
communication. You can't have verbal communication with a man in New
South Wales, you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will say, informed, Mr. Jaggers.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have been informed by a person named Abel Magwitch, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Magwitch</b></font>) is the
benefactor so long unknown to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is the man,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jaggers/Jaggers/MR. JAGGERS</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Jaggers, <div class="bookquote">``in New South Wales.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jaggers/Jaggers/MR. JAGGERS</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And only he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And only he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Jaggers.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not so unreasonable, sir, as to think you at all responsible for
my mistakes and wrong conclusions; but I always supposed it was Miss
Havisham.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``As you say, Pip,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jaggers/Jaggers/MR. JAGGERS</b></font>)</div>returned Mr. Jaggers, turning his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) eyes upon
me coolly, and taking a bite at his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) forefinger, <div class="bookquote">``I am not at all
responsible for that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And yet it looked so like it, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I pleaded with a downcast heart.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not a particle of evidence, Pip,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jaggers/Jaggers/MR. JAGGERS</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Jaggers, shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) head
and gathering up his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) skirts. <div class="bookquote">``Take nothing on its looks; take everything
on evidence. There's no better rule.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have no more to say,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, with a sigh, after standing silent for
a little while. <div class="bookquote">``I have verified my information, and there's an end.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And Magwitch--in New South Wales--having at last disclosed himself,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jaggers/Jaggers/MR. JAGGERS</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Jaggers, <div class="bookquote">``you will comprehend, Pip, how rigidly throughout
my communication with you, I have always adhered to the strict line of
fact. There has never been the least departure from the strict line of
fact. You are quite aware of that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jaggers/Jaggers/MR. JAGGERS</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Quite, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I communicated to Magwitch--in New South Wales--when he (<font color='blue'><b>Magwitch</b></font>) first wrote to
me--from New South Wales--the caution that he (<font color='blue'><b>Magwitch</b></font>) must not expect me ever to
deviate from the strict line of fact. I also communicated to him (<font color='blue'><b>Magwitch</b></font>) another
caution. He (<font color='blue'><b>Magwitch</b></font>) appeared to me to have obscurely hinted in his (<font color='blue'><b>Magwitch</b></font>) letter at
some distant idea he (<font color='blue'><b>Magwitch</b></font>) had of seeing you in England here. I cautioned
him (<font color='blue'><b>Magwitch</b></font>) that I must hear no more of that; that he (<font color='blue'><b>Magwitch</b></font>) was not at all likely to
obtain a pardon; that he (<font color='blue'><b>Magwitch</b></font>) was expatriated for the term of his (<font color='blue'><b>Magwitch</b></font>) natural
life; and that his (<font color='blue'><b>Magwitch</b></font>) presenting himself in this country would be an act of
felony, rendering him (<font color='blue'><b>Magwitch</b></font>) liable to the extreme penalty of the law. I gave
Magwitch that caution,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jaggers/Jaggers/MR. JAGGERS</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Jaggers, looking hard at me; <div class="bookquote">``I wrote
it to New South Wales. He (<font color='blue'><b>Magwitch</b></font>) guided himself by it, no doubt.''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No doubt,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have been informed by Wemmick,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>pursued Mr. Jaggers, still looking
hard at me, <div class="bookquote">``that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) has received a letter, under date Portsmouth, from
a colonist of the name of Purvis, or--''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Or Provis,''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>I suggested.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Or Provis--thank you, Pip. Perhaps it is Provis? Perhaps you know it's
Provis?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You know it's Provis. A letter, under date Portsmouth, from a colonist
of the name of Provis, asking for the particulars of your address, on
behalf of Magwitch. Wemmick sent him (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) the particulars, I understand, by
return of post. Probably it is through Provis that you have received the
explanation of Magwitch--in New South Wales?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It came through Provis,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I replied.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good day, Pip,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jaggers/Jaggers/MR. JAGGERS</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Jaggers, offering his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) hand; <div class="bookquote">``glad to have
seen you. In writing by post to Magwitch--in New South Wales--or in
communicating with him (<font color='blue'><b>Magwitch</b></font>) through Provis, have the goodness to mention that
the particulars and vouchers of our long account shall be sent to you,
together with the balance; for there is still a balance remaining. Good
day, Pip!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jaggers/Jaggers/MR. JAGGERS</b></font>)</div><p/>We shook hands, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) looked hard at me as long as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) could see me. I
turned at the door, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) was still looking hard at me, while the two
vile casts on the shelf seemed to be trying to get their eyelids open,
and to force out of their swollen throats, <div class="bookquote">``O, what a man he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is!''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>Wemmick was out, and though he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) had been at his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) desk he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) could have done
nothing for me. I went straight back to the Temple, where I found
the terrible Provis drinking rum and water and smoking negro-head, in
safety.

<p/>Next day the clothes I had ordered all came home, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Provis</b></font>) put them on.
Whatever he (<font color='blue'><b>Provis</b></font>) put on, became him (<font color='blue'><b>Provis</b></font>) less -LRB-it dismally seemed to me-RRB- than what
he (<font color='blue'><b>Provis</b></font>) had worn before. To my thinking, there was something in him (<font color='blue'><b>Provis</b></font>) that made
it hopeless to attempt to disguise him (<font color='blue'><b>Provis</b></font>). The more I dressed him (<font color='blue'><b>Provis</b></font>) and the
better I dressed him (<font color='blue'><b>Provis</b></font>), the more he (<font color='blue'><b>Provis</b></font>) looked like the slouching fugitive on
the marshes. This effect on my anxious fancy was partly referable, no
doubt, to his (<font color='blue'><b>Provis</b></font>) old face and manner growing more familiar to me; but I
believe too that he (<font color='blue'><b>Provis</b></font>) dragged one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Provis</b></font>) legs as if there were still a
weight of iron on it, and that from head to foot there was Convict in
the very grain of the man.

<p/>The influences of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) solitary hut-life were upon him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) besides, and
gave him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) a savage air that no dress could tame; added to these were the
influences of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) subsequent branded life among men, and, crowning all,
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) consciousness that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was dodging and hiding now. In all his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ways of
sitting and standing, and eating and drinking,--of brooding about in a
high-shouldered reluctant style,--of taking out his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) great horn-handled
jackknife and wiping it on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) legs and cutting his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) food,--of
lifting light glasses and cups to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lips, as if they were clumsy
pannikins,--of chopping a wedge off his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) bread, and soaking up with it
the last fragments of gravy round and round his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) plate, as if to make the
most of an allowance, and then drying his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) finger-ends on it, and then
swallowing it,--in these ways and a thousand other small nameless
instances arising every minute in the day, there was Prisoner, Felon,
Bondsman, plain as plain could be.

<p/>It had been his (<font color='blue'><b>Prisoner</b></font>) own idea to wear that touch of powder, and I had
conceded the powder after overcoming the shorts. But I can compare the
effect of it, when on, to nothing but the probable effect of rouge upon
the dead; so awful was the manner in which everything in him (<font color='blue'><b>Prisoner</b></font>) that it was
most desirable to repress, started through that thin layer of pretence,
and seemed to come blazing out at the crown of his (<font color='blue'><b>Prisoner</b></font>) head. It was
abandoned as soon as tried, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Prisoner</b></font>) wore his (<font color='blue'><b>Prisoner</b></font>) grizzled hair cut short.

<p/>Words cannot tell what a sense I had, at the same time, of the dreadful
mystery that he (<font color='blue'><b>Prisoner</b></font>) was to me. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Prisoner</b></font>) fell asleep of an evening, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Prisoner</b></font>)
knotted hands clenching the sides of the easy-chair, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Prisoner</b></font>) bald head
tattooed with deep wrinkles falling forward on his (<font color='blue'><b>Prisoner</b></font>) breast, I would sit
and look at him (<font color='blue'><b>Prisoner</b></font>), wondering what he (<font color='blue'><b>Prisoner</b></font>) had done, and loading him (<font color='blue'><b>Prisoner</b></font>) with all
the crimes in the Calendar, until the impulse was powerful on me to
start up and fly from him (<font color='blue'><b>Prisoner</b></font>). Every hour so increased my abhorrence of
him (<font color='blue'><b>Prisoner</b></font>), that I even think I might have yielded to this impulse in the first
agonies of being so haunted, notwithstanding all he (<font color='blue'><b>Prisoner</b></font>) had done for me and
the risk he (<font color='blue'><b>Prisoner</b></font>) ran, but for the knowledge that Herbert must soon come back.
Once, I actually did start out of bed in the night, and begin to dress
myself in my worst clothes, hurriedly intending to leave him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) there with
everything else I possessed, and enlist for India as a private soldier.

<p/>I doubt if a ghost could have been more terrible to me, up in those
lonely rooms in the long evenings and long nights, with the wind and the
rain always rushing by. A ghost could not have been taken and hanged on
my account, and the consideration that he (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) could be, and the dread that
he (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) would be, were no small addition to my horrors. When he (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) was not
asleep, or playing a complicated kind of Patience with a ragged pack of
cards of his (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) own,--a game that I never saw before or since, and in which
he (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) recorded his (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) winnings by sticking his (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) jackknife into the table,--when
he (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) was not engaged in either of these pursuits, he (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) would ask me to
read to him (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>),--<div class="bookquote">``Foreign language, dear boy!''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>While I complied, he (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>), not
comprehending a single word, would stand before the fire surveying me
with the air of an Exhibitor, and I would see him (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>), between the fingers
of the hand with which I shaded my face, appealing in dumb show to
the furniture to take notice of my proficiency. The imaginary student
pursued by the misshapen creature he (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) had impiously made, was not more
wretched than I, pursued by the creature who had made me, and recoiling
from him (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) with a stronger repulsion, the more he (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) admired me and the
fonder he (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) was of me.

<p/>This is written of, I am sensible, as if it had lasted a year. It lasted
about five days. Expecting Herbert all the time, I dared not go out,
except when I took Provis for an airing after dark. At length, one
evening when dinner was over and I had dropped into a slumber quite
worn out,--for my nights had been agitated and my rest broken by fearful
dreams,--I was roused by the welcome footstep on the staircase. Provis,
who had been asleep too, staggered up at the noise I made, and in an
instant I saw his (<font color='blue'><b>Provis</b></font>) jackknife shining in his (<font color='blue'><b>Provis</b></font>) hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Quiet! It's Herbert!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said; and Herbert came bursting in, with the
airy freshness of six hundred miles of France upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Handel, my dear fellow, how are you, and again how are you, and again
how are you? I seem to have been gone a twelvemonth! Why, so I must have
been, for you have grown quite thin and pale! Handel, my--Halloa! I beg
your pardon.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) was stopped in his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) running on and in his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) shaking hands with me, by
seeing Provis. Provis, regarding him (<font color='blue'><b>Provis</b></font>) with a fixed attention, was slowly
putting up his (<font color='blue'><b>Provis</b></font>) jackknife, and groping in another pocket for something
else.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Herbert, my dear friend,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, shutting the double doors, while
Herbert stood staring and wondering, <div class="bookquote">``something very strange has
happened. This is--a visitor of mine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Herbert/Herbert Pocket</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's all right, dear boy!''  (<font color='red'><b>Provis/Mr. Provis</b></font>)</div>said Provis coming forward, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Provis</b></font>) little
clasped black book, and then addressing himself to Herbert. <div class="bookquote">``Take it in
your right hand. Lord strike you dead on the spot, if ever you split in
any way sumever! Kiss it!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do so, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) wishes it,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said to Herbert. So, Herbert, looking at
me with a friendly uneasiness and amazement, complied, and Provis
immediately shaking hands with him (<font color='blue'><b>Provis</b></font>), said, <div class="bookquote">``Now you're on your oath, you
know. And never believe me on mine, if Pip shan't make a gentleman on
you!''




 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>Chapter XLI

<p/>In vain should I attempt to describe the astonishment and disquiet
of Herbert, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) and I and Provis sat down before the fire, and I
recounted the whole of the secret. Enough, that I saw my own feelings
reflected in Herbert's face, and not least among them, my repugnance
towards the man who had done so much for me.

<p/>What would alone have set a division between that man and us, if there
had been no other dividing circumstance, was his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) triumph in my story.
Saving his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) troublesome sense of having been <div class="bookquote">``low''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>on one occasion since
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) return,--on which point he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) began to hold forth to Herbert, the
moment my revelation was finished,--he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) had no perception of the
possibility of my finding any fault with my good fortune. His (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) boast that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) had made me a gentleman, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) had come to see me support the
character on his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) ample resources, was made for me quite as much as for
himself. And that it was a highly agreeable boast to both of us,
and that we must both be very proud of it, was a conclusion quite
established in his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) own mind.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Though, look'ee here, Pip's comrade,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) said to Herbert, after having
discoursed for some time, <div class="bookquote">``I know very well that once since I come
back--for half a minute--I've been low. I said to Pip, I knowed as I had
been low. But don't you fret yourself on that score. I ain't made Pip a
gentleman, and Pip ain't a going to make you a gentleman, not fur me not
to know what's due to ye both. Dear boy, and Pip's comrade, you two may
count upon me always having a gen-teel muzzle on. Muzzled I have been
since that half a minute when I was betrayed into lowness, muzzled I am
at the present time, muzzled I ever will be.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Herbert/Herbert Pocket</b></font>)</div><p/>Herbert said, <div class="bookquote">``Certainly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Herbert/Herbert Pocket</b></font>)</div>but looked as if there were no specific
consolation in this, and remained perplexed and dismayed. We were
anxious for the time when he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) would go to his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) lodging and leave us
together, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) was evidently jealous of leaving us together, and sat
late. It was midnight before I took him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) round to Essex Street, and
saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) safely in at his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) own dark door. When it closed upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>), I
experienced the first moment of relief I had known since the night of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) arrival.

<p/>Never quite free from an uneasy remembrance of the man on the stairs,
I had always looked about me in taking my guest out after dark, and in
bringing him (<font color='blue'><b>guest</b></font>) back; and I looked about me now. Difficult as it is in a
large city to avoid the suspicion of being watched, when the mind is
conscious of danger in that regard, I could not persuade myself that any
of the people within sight cared about my movements. The few who were
passing passed on their several ways, and the street was empty when I
turned back into the Temple. Nobody had come out at the gate with us,
nobody went in at the gate with me. As I crossed by the fountain, I saw
his (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>) lighted back windows looking bright and quiet, and, when I stood for
a few moments in the doorway of the building where I lived, before going
up the stairs, Garden Court was as still and lifeless as the staircase
was when I ascended it.

<p/>Herbert received me with open arms, and I had never felt before so
blessedly what it is to have a friend. When he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had spoken some sound
words of sympathy and encouragement, we sat down to consider the
question, What was to be done?

<p/>The chair that Provis had occupied still remaining where it had
stood,--for he (<font color='blue'><b>Provis</b></font>) had a barrack way with him (<font color='blue'><b>Provis</b></font>) of hanging about one spot, in
one unsettled manner, and going through one round of observances with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Provis</b></font>) pipe and his (<font color='blue'><b>Provis</b></font>) negro-head and his (<font color='blue'><b>Provis</b></font>) jackknife and his (<font color='blue'><b>Provis</b></font>) pack of cards,
and what not, as if it were all put down for him (<font color='blue'><b>Provis</b></font>) on a slate,--I say his (<font color='blue'><b>Provis</b></font>)
chair remaining where it had stood, Herbert unconsciously took it, but
next moment started out of it, pushed it away, and took another. He (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) had
no occasion to say after that that he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) had conceived an aversion for my
patron, neither had I occasion to confess my own. We interchanged that
confidence without shaping a syllable.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I to Herbert, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) was safe in another chair,--<div class="bookquote">``what is
to be done?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My poor dear Handel,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) replied, holding his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) head, <div class="bookquote">``I am too stunned
to think.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So was I, Herbert, when the blow first fell. Still, something must be
done. He (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) is intent upon various new expenses,--horses, and carriages,
and lavish appearances of all kinds. He (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) must be stopped somehow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You mean that you can't accept--''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How can I?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I interposed, as Herbert paused. <div class="bookquote">``Think of him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>)! Look at
him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>An involuntary shudder passed over both of us.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yet I am afraid the dreadful truth is, Herbert, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) is attached to
me, strongly attached to me. Was there ever such a fate!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My poor dear Handel,''  (<font color='red'><b>Herbert/Herbert Pocket</b></font>)</div>Herbert repeated.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, <div class="bookquote">``after all, stopping short here, never taking another
penny from him (<font color='blue'><b>Handel</b></font>), think what I owe him (<font color='blue'><b>Handel</b></font>) already! Then again: I am heavily
in debt,--very heavily for me, who have now no expectations,--and I have
been bred to no calling, and I am fit for nothing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, well, well!''  (<font color='red'><b>Herbert/Herbert Pocket</b></font>)</div>Herbert remonstrated. <div class="bookquote">``Don't say fit for nothing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What am I fit for? I know only one thing that I am fit for, and that
is, to go for a soldier. And I might have gone, my dear Herbert, but for
the prospect of taking counsel with your friendship and affection.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Of course I broke down there: and of course Herbert, beyond seizing a
warm grip of my hand, pretended not to know it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Anyhow, my dear Handel,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) presently, <div class="bookquote">``soldiering won't do. If
you were to renounce this patronage and these favors, I suppose you
would do so with some faint hope of one day repaying what you have
already had. Not very strong, that hope, if you went soldiering!
Besides, it's absurd. You would be infinitely better in Clarriker's
house, small as it is. I am working up towards a partnership, you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Poor fellow! He (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) little suspected with whose money.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But there is another question,''  (<font color='red'><b>Herbert/Herbert Pocket</b></font>)</div>said Herbert. <div class="bookquote">``This is an ignorant,
determined man, who has long had one fixed idea. More than that, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
seems to me -LRB-I may misjudge him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)-RRB- to be a man of a desperate and fierce
character.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) is,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I returned. <div class="bookquote">``Let me tell you what evidence I have seen
of it.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>And I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) what I had not mentioned in my narrative, of that
encounter with the other convict.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``See, then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Herbert/Herbert Pocket</b></font>)</div>said Herbert; <div class="bookquote">``think of this! He (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) comes here at the peril
of his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) life, for the realization of his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) fixed idea. In the moment of
realization, after all his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) toil and waiting, you cut the ground from
under his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) feet, destroy his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) idea, and make his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) gains worthless to him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>).
Do you see nothing that he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) might do, under the disappointment?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Herbert/Herbert Pocket</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have seen it, Herbert, and dreamed of it, ever since the fatal night
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) arrival. Nothing has been in my thoughts so distinctly as his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>)
putting himself in the way of being taken.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then you may rely upon it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Herbert/Herbert Pocket</b></font>)</div>said Herbert, <div class="bookquote">``that there would be great
danger of his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) doing it. That is his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) power over you as long as he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) remains
in England, and that would be his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) reckless course if you forsook him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Herbert/Herbert Pocket</b></font>)</div><p/>I was so struck by the horror of this idea, which had weighed upon
me from the first, and the working out of which would make me regard
myself, in some sort, as his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) murderer, that I could not rest in my
chair, but began pacing to and fro. I said to Herbert, meanwhile, that
even if Provis were recognized and taken, in spite of himself, I should
be wretched as the cause, however innocently. Yes; even though I was so
wretched in having him (<font color='blue'><b>Provis</b></font>) at large and near me, and even though I would
far rather have worked at the forge all the days of my life than I would
ever have come to this!

<p/>But there was no staving off the question, What was to be done?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The first and the main thing to be done,''  (<font color='red'><b>Herbert/Herbert Pocket</b></font>)</div>said Herbert, <div class="bookquote">``is to get him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>)
out of England. You will have to go with him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>), and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) may be induced
to go.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Herbert/Herbert Pocket</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But get him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) where I will, could I prevent his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) coming back?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My good Handel, is it not obvious that with Newgate in the next street,
there must be far greater hazard in your breaking your mind to him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) and
making him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) reckless, here, than elsewhere? If a pretext to get him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) away
could be made out of that other convict, or out of anything else in his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>)
life, now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There, again!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, stopping before Herbert, with my open hands held
out, as if they contained the desperation of the case. <div class="bookquote">``I know nothing
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) life. It has almost made me mad to sit here of a night and see
him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) before me, so bound up with my fortunes and misfortunes, and yet so
unknown to me, except as the miserable wretch who terrified me two days
in my childhood!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Herbert/Herbert Pocket</b></font>)</div><p/>Herbert got up, and linked his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) arm in mine, and we slowly walked to and
fro together, studying the carpet.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Handel,''  (<font color='red'><b>Herbert/Herbert Pocket</b></font>)</div>said Herbert, stopping, <div class="bookquote">``you feel convinced that you can take
no further benefits from him (<font color='blue'><b>Handel</b></font>); do you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Herbert/Herbert Pocket</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Fully. Surely you would, too, if you were in my place?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you feel convinced that you must break with him (<font color='blue'><b>Handel</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Herbert, can you ask me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you have, and are bound to have, that tenderness for the life he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>)
has risked on your account, that you must save him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>), if possible, from
throwing it away. Then you must get him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) out of England before you stir a
finger to extricate yourself. That done, extricate yourself, in Heaven's
name, and we'll see it out together, dear old boy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>It was a comfort to shake hands upon it, and walk up and down again,
with only that done.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, Herbert,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, <div class="bookquote">``with reference to gaining some knowledge of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) history. There is but one way that I know of. I must ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) point
blank.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. Ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Herbert/Herbert Pocket</b></font>)</div>said Herbert, <div class="bookquote">``when we sit at breakfast in the morning.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Herbert/Herbert Pocket</b></font>)</div>For he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) had said, on taking leave of Herbert, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) would come to
breakfast with us.

<p/>With this project formed, we went to bed. I had the wildest dreams
concerning him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>), and woke unrefreshed; I woke, too, to recover the fear
which I had lost in the night, of his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) being found out as a returned
transport. Waking, I never lost that fear.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) came round at the appointed time, took out his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) jackknife, and sat
down to his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) meal. He (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) was full of plans <div class="bookquote">``for his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) gentleman's coming out
strong, and like a gentleman,''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>and urged me to begin speedily upon
the pocket-book which he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) had left in my possession. He (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) considered the
chambers and his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) own lodging as temporary residences, and advised me to
look out at once for a <div class="bookquote">``fashionable crib''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>near Hyde Park, in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Hyde</b></font>)
could have <div class="bookquote">``a shake-down.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Hyde</b></font>) had made an end of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hyde</b></font>) breakfast,
and was wiping his (<font color='blue'><b>Hyde</b></font>) knife on his (<font color='blue'><b>Hyde</b></font>) leg, I said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Hyde</b></font>), without a word of
preface,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``After you were gone last night, I told my friend of the struggle that
the soldiers found you engaged in on the marshes, when we came up. You
remember?''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Remember!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Hyde</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I think so!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We want to know something about that man--and about you. It is strange
to know no more about either, and particularly you, than I was able to
tell last night. Is not this as good a time as another for our knowing
more?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Hyde</b></font>) said, after consideration. <div class="bookquote">``You're on your oath, you know,
Pip's comrade?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Assuredly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Herbert/Herbert Pocket</b></font>)</div>replied Herbert.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``As to anything I say, you know,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) insisted. <div class="bookquote">``The oath applies to
all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I understand it to do so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And look'ee here! Wotever I done is worked out and paid for,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>)
insisted again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So be it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) took out his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) black pipe and was going to fill it with negro-head,
when, looking at the tangle of tobacco in his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) hand, he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) seemed to think
it might perplex the thread of his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) narrative. He (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) put it back again,
stuck his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) pipe in a button-hole of his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) coat, spread a hand on each knee,
and after turning an angry eye on the fire for a few silent moments,
looked round at us and said what follows.




<p/>Chapter XLII

<p/>``Dear boy and Pip's comrade. I am not a going fur to tell you my life
like a song, or a story-book. But to give it you short and handy, I'll
put it at once into a mouthful of English. In jail and out of jail, in
jail and out of jail, in jail and out of jail. There, you've got it.
That's my life pretty much, down to such times as I got shipped off,
arter Pip stood my friend.

<p/>``I've been done everything to, pretty well--except hanged. I've been
locked up as much as a silver tea-kittle. I've been carted here and
carted there, and put out of this town, and put out of that town, and
stuck in the stocks, and whipped and worried and drove. I've no more
notion where I was born than you have--if so much. I first become aware
of myself down in Essex, a thieving turnips for my living. Summun had
run away from me--a man--a tinker--and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'d took the fire with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and
left me wery cold.

<p/>``I know'd my name to be Magwitch, chrisen'd Abel. How did I know
it? Much as I know'd the birds' names in the hedges to be chaffinch,
sparrer, thrush. I might have thought it was all lies together, only as
the birds' names come out true, I supposed mine did.

<p/>``So fur as I could find, there warn't a soul that see young Abel
Magwitch, with us little on him (<font color='blue'><b>Magwitch</b></font>) as in him (<font color='blue'><b>Magwitch</b></font>), but wot caught fright at him (<font color='blue'><b>Magwitch</b></font>),
and either drove him (<font color='blue'><b>Magwitch</b></font>) off, or took him (<font color='blue'><b>Magwitch</b></font>) up. I was took up, took up, took
up, to that extent that I reg'larly grow'd up took up.

<p/>``This is the way it was, that when I was a ragged little creetur as much
to be pitied as ever I see -LRB-not that I looked in the glass, for there
warn't many insides of furnished houses known to me-RRB-, I got the name of
being hardened. `This is a terrible hardened one,' they says to prison
wisitors, picking out me. `May be said to live in jails, this boy.' Then
they looked at me, and I looked at them, and they measured my head, some
on `em,--they had better a measured my stomach,--and others on `em giv
me tracts what I couldn't read, and made me speeches what I couldn't
understand. They always went on agen me about the Devil. But what
the Devil was I to do? I must put something into my stomach, mustn't
I?--Howsomever, I'm a getting low, and I know what's due. Dear boy and
Pip's comrade, don't you be afeerd of me being low.

<p/>``Tramping, begging, thieving, working sometimes when I could,--though
that warn't as often as you may think, till you put the question whether
you would ha' been over-ready to give me work yourselves,--a bit of a
poacher, a bit of a laborer, a bit of a wagoner, a bit of a haymaker,
a bit of a hawker, a bit of most things that don't pay and lead to
trouble, I got to be a man. A deserting soldier in a Traveller's Rest,
what lay hid up to the chin under a lot of taturs, learnt me to read;
and a travelling Giant what signed his (<font color='blue'><b>Traveller</b></font>) name at a penny a time learnt me
to write. I warn't locked up as often now as formerly, but I wore out my
good share of key-metal still.

<p/>``At Epsom races, a matter of over twenty years ago, I got acquainted wi'
a man whose skull I'd crack wi' this poker, like the claw of a lobster,
if I'd got it on this hob. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) right name was Compeyson; and that's the
man, dear boy, what you see me a pounding in the ditch, according to
what you truly told your comrade arter I was gone last night.

<p/>``He (<font color='blue'><b>comrade</b></font>) set up fur a gentleman, this Compeyson, and he (<font color='blue'><b>comrade</b></font>)'d been to a public
boarding-school and had learning. He (<font color='blue'><b>comrade</b></font>) was a smooth one to talk, and was
a dab at the ways of gentlefolks. He (<font color='blue'><b>comrade</b></font>) was good-looking too. It was the
night afore the great race, when I found him (<font color='blue'><b>comrade</b></font>) on the heath, in a booth
that I know'd on. Him (<font color='blue'><b>comrade</b></font>) and some more was a sitting among the tables when
I went in, and the landlord -LRB-which had a knowledge of me, and was a
sporting one-RRB- called him (<font color='blue'><b>comrade</b></font>) out, and said, `I think this is a man that
might suit you,'--meaning I was.

<p/>``Compeyson, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) looks at me very noticing, and I look at him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has a
watch and a chain and a ring and a breast-pin and a handsome suit of
clothes.

<p/>```To judge from appearances, you're out of luck,' says Compeyson to me.

<p/>```Yes, master, and I've never been in it much.' -LRB-I had come out of
Kingston Jail last on a vagrancy committal. Not but what it might have
been for something else; but it warn't.-RRB-

<p/>```Luck changes,' says Compeyson; `perhaps yours is going to change.'

<p/>``I says, `I hope it may be so. There's room.'

<p/>```What can you do?' says Compeyson.

<p/>```Eat and drink,' I says; `if you'll find the materials.'

<p/>``Compeyson laughed, looked at me again very noticing, giv me five
shillings, and appointed me for next night. Same place.

<p/>``I went to Compeyson next night, same place, and Compeyson took me on
to be his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) man and pardner. And what was Compeyson's business in which we
was to go pardners? Compeyson's business was the swindling, handwriting
forging, stolen bank-note passing, and such-like. All sorts of traps as
Compeyson could set with his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) head, and keep his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) own legs out of and get
the profits from and let another man in for, was Compeyson's business.
He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'d no more heart than a iron file, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was as cold as death, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had
the head of the Devil afore mentioned.

<p/>``There was another in with Compeyson, as was called Arthur,--not as
being so chrisen'd, but as a surname. He (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) was in a Decline, and was a
shadow to look at. Him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) and Compeyson had been in a bad thing with a
rich lady some years afore, and they'd made a pot of money by it; but
Compeyson betted and gamed, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>)'d have run through the king's taxes.
So, Arthur was a dying, and a dying poor and with the horrors on him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>),
and Compeyson's wife -LRB-which Compeyson kicked mostly-RRB- was a having pity
on him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) when she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) could, and Compeyson was a having pity on nothing and
nobody.

<p/>``I might a took warning by Arthur, but I didn't; and I won't pretend I
was partick'ler--for where `ud be the good on it, dear boy and comrade?
So I begun wi' Compeyson, and a poor tool I was in his (<font color='blue'><b>comrade</b></font>) hands. Arthur
lived at the top of Compeyson's house -LRB-over nigh Brentford it was-RRB-, and
Compeyson kept a careful account agen him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) for board and lodging, in case
he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) should ever get better to work it out. But Arthur soon settled the
account. The second or third time as ever I see him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) come a tearing
down into Compeyson's parlor late at night, in only a flannel gown, with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) hair all in a sweat, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) says to Compeyson's wife, `Sally, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>)
really is upstairs alonger me, now, and I can't get rid of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>)'s
all in white,' he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) says, `wi' white flowers in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>) hair, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>)'s awful
mad, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>)'s got a shroud hanging over her (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>) arm, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>) says she (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>)'ll
put it on me at five in the morning.'

<p/>``Says Compeyson: `Why, you fool, don't you know she (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>)'s got a living body?
And how should she (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>) be up there, without coming through the door, or in
at the window, and up the stairs?'

<p/>```I don't know how she (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>)'s there,' says Arthur, shivering dreadful with
the horrors, `but she (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>)'s standing in the corner at the foot of the bed,
awful mad. And over where her (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>) heart's broke--you broke it!--there's
drops of blood.'

<p/>``Compeyson spoke hardy, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) was always a coward. `Go up alonger this
drivelling sick man,' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) says to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife, `and Magwitch, lend her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) a
hand, will you?' But he (<font color='blue'><b>Magwitch</b></font>) never come nigh himself.

<p/>``Compeyson's wife and me took him (<font color='blue'><b>Magwitch</b></font>) up to bed agen, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Magwitch</b></font>) raved most
dreadful. `Why look at her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)!' he (<font color='blue'><b>Magwitch</b></font>) cries out. `She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)'s a shaking the shroud
at me! Don't you see her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)? Look at her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) eyes! Ain't it awful to see her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) so
mad?' Next he (<font color='blue'><b>Magwitch</b></font>) cries, `She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)'ll put it on me, and then I'm done for! Take
it away from her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), take it away!' And then he (<font color='blue'><b>Magwitch</b></font>) catched hold of us, and kep
on a talking to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), and answering of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), till I half believed I see
her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) myself.

<p/>``Compeyson's wife, being used to him (<font color='blue'><b>Magwitch</b></font>), giv him (<font color='blue'><b>Magwitch</b></font>) some liquor to get the
horrors off, and by and by he (<font color='blue'><b>Magwitch</b></font>) quieted. `O, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)'s gone! Has her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) keeper
been for her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)?' he (<font color='blue'><b>Magwitch</b></font>) says. `Yes,' says Compeyson's wife. `Did you tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Magwitch</b></font>)
to lock her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) and bar her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) in?' `Yes.' `And to take that ugly thing away
from her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)?' `Yes, yes, all right.' `You're a good creetur,' he (<font color='blue'><b>Magwitch</b></font>) says,
`don't leave me, whatever you do, and thank you!'

<p/>``He (<font color='blue'><b>Magwitch</b></font>) rested pretty quiet till it might want a few minutes of five, and
then he (<font color='blue'><b>Magwitch</b></font>) starts up with a scream, and screams out, `Here she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) is! She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)'s
got the shroud again. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)'s unfolding it. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)'s coming out of the
corner. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)'s coming to the bed. Hold me, both on you--one of each
side--don't let her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) touch me with it. Hah! she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) missed me that time.
Don't let her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) throw it over my shoulders. Don't let her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) lift me up to
get it round me. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)'s lifting me up. Keep me down!' Then he (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) lifted
himself up hard, and was dead.

<p/>``Compeyson took it easy as a good riddance for both sides. Him (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) and
me was soon busy, and first he (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) swore me -LRB-being ever artful-RRB- on my own
book,--this here little black book, dear boy, what I swore your comrade
on.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not to go into the things that Compeyson planned, and I done--which `ud
take a week--I'll simply say to you, dear boy, and Pip's comrade, that
that man got me into such nets as made me his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) black slave. I was always
in debt to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), always under his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thumb, always a working, always a
getting into danger. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was younger than me, but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'d got craft, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'d got learning, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) overmatched me five hundred times told and
no mercy. My Missis as I had the hard time wi'--Stop though! I ain't
brought her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in--''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) looked about him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) in a confused way, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) had lost his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) place in
the book of his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) remembrance; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) face to the fire, and
spread his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) hands broader on his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) knees, and lifted them off and put them
on again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There ain't no need to go into it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) said, looking round once more.
<div class="bookquote">``The time wi' Compeyson was a'most as hard a time as ever I had; that
said, all's said. Did I tell you as I was tried, alone, for misdemeanor,
while with Compeyson?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I answered, No.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) said, ``I was, and got convicted. As to took up on suspicion,
that was twice or three times in the four or five year that it lasted;
but evidence was wanting. At last, me and Compeyson was both committed
for felony,--on a charge of putting stolen notes in circulation,--and
there was other charges behind. Compeyson says to me, `Separate
defences, no communication,' and that was all. And I was so miserable
poor, that I sold all the clothes I had, except what hung on my back,
afore I could get Jaggers.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``When we was put in the dock, I noticed first of all what a gentleman
Compeyson looked, wi' his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) curly hair and his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) black clothes and his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) white
pocket-handkercher, and what a common sort of a wretch I looked. When
the prosecution opened and the evidence was put short, aforehand, I
noticed how heavy it all bore on me, and how light on him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>). When the
evidence was giv in the box, I noticed how it was always me that had
come for'ard, and could be swore to, how it was always me that the money
had been paid to, how it was always me that had seemed to work the thing
and get the profit. But when the defence come on, then I see the plan
plainer; for, says the counsellor for Compeyson, `My lord and gentlemen,
here you has afore you, side by side, two persons as your eyes can
separate wide; one, the younger, well brought up, who will be spoke to
as such; one, the elder, ill brought up, who will be spoke to as such;
one, the younger, seldom if ever seen in these here transactions, and
only suspected; t'other, the elder, always seen in `em and always wi' his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>)
guilt brought home. Can you doubt, if there is but one in it, which is
the one, and, if there is two in it, which is much the worst one?' And
such-like. And when it come to character, warn't it Compeyson as had
been to the school, and warn't it his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) schoolfellows as was in this
position and in that, and warn't it him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) as had been know'd by witnesses
in such clubs and societies, and nowt to his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) disadvantage? And warn't it
me as had been tried afore, and as had been know'd up hill and down dale
in Bridewells and Lock-Ups! And when it come to speech-making, warn't it
Compeyson as could speak to `em wi' his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) face dropping every now and then
into his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) white pocket-handkercher,--ah! and wi' verses in his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) speech,
too,--and warn't it me as could only say, `Gentlemen, this man at my
side is a most precious rascal'? And when the verdict come, warn't it
Compeyson as was recommended to mercy on account of good character and
bad company, and giving up all the information he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) could agen me,
and warn't it me as got never a word but Guilty? And when I says to
Compeyson, `Once out of this court, I'll smash that face of yourn!'
ain't it Compeyson as prays the Judge to be protected, and gets two
turnkeys stood betwixt us? And when we're sentenced, ain't it him (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) as
gets seven year, and me fourteen, and ain't it him (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) as the Judge is
sorry for, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) might a done so well, and ain't it me as the Judge
perceives to be a old offender of wiolent passion, likely to come to
worse?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) had worked himself into a state of great excitement, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) checked
it, took two or three short breaths, swallowed as often, and stretching
out his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) hand towards me said, in a reassuring manner, <div class="bookquote">``I ain't a going
to be low, dear boy!''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) had so heated himself that he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) took out his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) handkerchief and wiped his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>)
face and head and neck and hands, before he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) could go on.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I had said to Compeyson that I'd smash that face of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), and I swore
Lord smash mine! to do it. We was in the same prison-ship, but I
couldn't get at him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) for long, though I tried. At last I come behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>)
and hit him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) on the cheek to turn him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) round and get a smashing one at
him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>), when I was seen and seized. The black-hole of that ship warn't
a strong one, to a judge of black-holes that could swim and dive. I
escaped to the shore, and I was a hiding among the graves there, envying
them as was in `em and all over, when I first see my boy!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) regarded me with a look of affection that made him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) almost abhorrent
to me again, though I had felt great pity for him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>).

<p/>``By my boy, I was giv to understand as Compeyson was out on them marshes
too. Upon my soul, I half believe he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) escaped in his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) terror, to get quit
of me, not knowing it was me as had got ashore. I hunted him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) down. I
smashed his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) face. `And now,' says I `as the worst thing I can do, caring
nothing for myself, I'll drag you back.' And I'd have swum off, towing
him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) by the hair, if it had come to that, and I'd a got him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) aboard
without the soldiers.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)'d much the best of it to the last,--his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) character was so
good. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had escaped when he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was made half wild by me and my murderous
intentions; and his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) punishment was light. I was put in irons, brought
to trial again, and sent for life. I didn't stop for life, dear boy and
Pip's comrade, being here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) wiped himself again, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) had done before, and then slowly took
his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) tangle of tobacco from his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) pocket, and plucked his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) pipe from his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>)
button-hole, and slowly filled it, and began to smoke.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) dead?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked, after a silence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is who dead, dear boy?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) hopes I am, if he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)'s alive, you may be sure,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>with a fierce look. <div class="bookquote">``I
never heerd no more of him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Herbert/Herbert Pocket</b></font>)</div><p/>Herbert had been writing with his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) pencil in the cover of a book. He (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>)
softly pushed the book over to me, as Provis stood smoking with his (<font color='blue'><b>Provis</b></font>) eyes
on the fire, and I read in it:--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Young Havisham's name was Arthur. Compeyson is the man who professed to
be Miss Havisham's lover.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I shut the book and nodded slightly to Herbert, and put the book by; but
we neither of us said anything, and both looked at Provis as he (<font color='blue'><b>Provis</b></font>) stood
smoking by the fire.




<p/>Chapter XLIII

<p/>Why should I pause to ask how much of my shrinking from Provis might be
traced to Estella? Why should I loiter on my road, to compare the state
of mind in which I had tried to rid myself of the stain of the prison
before meeting her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) at the coach-office, with the state of mind in which
I now reflected on the abyss between Estella in her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) pride and beauty,
and the returned transport whom I harbored? The road would be none the
smoother for it, the end would be none the better for it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Provis</b></font>) would not
be helped, nor I extenuated.

<p/>A new fear had been engendered in my mind by his (<font color='blue'><b>Provis</b></font>) narrative; or rather,
his (<font color='blue'><b>Provis</b></font>) narrative had given form and purpose to the fear that was already
there. If Compeyson were alive and should discover his (<font color='blue'><b>Provis</b></font>) return, I could
hardly doubt the consequence. That Compeyson stood in mortal fear of
him (<font color='blue'><b>Provis</b></font>), neither of the two could know much better than I; and that any
such man as that man had been described to be would hesitate to release
himself for good from a dreaded enemy by the safe means of becoming an
informer was scarcely to be imagined.

<p/>Never had I breathed, and never would I breathe--or so I resolved--a
word of Estella to Provis. But, I said to Herbert that, before I could
go abroad, I must see both Estella and Miss Havisham. This was when we
were left alone on the night of the day when Provis told us his (<font color='blue'><b>Provis</b></font>) story. I
resolved to go out to Richmond next day, and I went.

<p/>On my presenting myself at Mrs. Brandley's, Estella's maid was called to
tell that Estella had gone into the country. Where? To Satis House, as
usual. Not as usual, I said, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) had never yet gone there without
me; when was she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) coming back? There was an air of reservation in the
answer which increased my perplexity, and the answer was, that her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) maid
believed she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) was only coming back at all for a little while. I could
make nothing of this, except that it was meant that I should make
nothing of it, and I went home again in complete discomfiture.

<p/>Another night consultation with Herbert after Provis was gone home -LRB-I
always took him (<font color='blue'><b>Provis</b></font>) home, and always looked well about me-RRB-, led us to the
conclusion that nothing should be said about going abroad until I came
back from Miss Havisham's. In the mean time, Herbert and I were to
consider separately what it would be best to say; whether we should
devise any pretence of being afraid that he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) was under suspicious
observation; or whether I, who had never yet been abroad, should propose
an expedition. We both knew that I had but to propose anything, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>)
would consent. We agreed that his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) remaining many days in his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) present
hazard was not to be thought of.

<p/>Next day I had the meanness to feign that I was under a binding promise
to go down to Joe; but I was capable of almost any meanness towards Joe
or his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) name. Provis was to be strictly careful while I was gone, and
Herbert was to take the charge of him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) that I had taken. I was to be
absent only one night, and, on my return, the gratification of his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>)
impatience for my starting as a gentleman on a greater scale was to
be begun. It occurred to me then, and as I afterwards found to
Herbert also, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) might be best got away across the water, on that
pretence,--as, to make purchases, or the like.

<p/>Having thus cleared the way for my expedition to Miss Havisham's, I set
off by the early morning coach before it was yet light, and was out
on the open country road when the day came creeping on, halting and
whimpering and shivering, and wrapped in patches of cloud and rags of
mist, like a beggar. When we drove up to the Blue Boar after a drizzly
ride, whom should I see come out under the gateway, toothpick in hand,
to look at the coach, but Bentley Drummle!

<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) pretended not to see me, I pretended not to see him (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>). It was a very
lame pretence on both sides; the lamer, because we both went into the
coffee-room, where he (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) had just finished his (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) breakfast, and where I
ordered mine. It was poisonous to me to see him (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) in the town, for I very
well knew why he (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) had come there.

<p/>Pretending to read a smeary newspaper long out of date, which had
nothing half so legible in its local news, as the foreign matter of
coffee, pickles, fish sauces, gravy, melted butter, and wine with which
it was sprinkled all over, as if it had taken the measles in a highly
irregular form, I sat at my table while he (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) stood before the fire. By
degrees it became an enormous injury to me that he (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) stood before the
fire. And I got up, determined to have my share of it. I had to put my
hand behind his (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) legs for the poker when I went up to the fireplace to
stir the fire, but still pretended not to know him (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is this a cut?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Drummle</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Drummle.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, poker in hand; <div class="bookquote">``it's you, is it? How do you do? I was
wondering who it was, who kept the fire off.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>With that, I poked tremendously, and having done so, planted myself side
by side with Mr. Drummle, my shoulders squared and my back to the fire.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You have just come down?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Drummle</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Drummle, edging me a little away
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Drummle</b></font>) shoulder.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, edging him (<font color='blue'><b>Drummle</b></font>) a little away with my shoulder.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Beastly place,''  (<font color='red'><b>Drummle/Bentley Drummle/Mrs. Bentley Drummle</b></font>)</div>said Drummle. <div class="bookquote">``Your part of the country, I think?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I assented. <div class="bookquote">``I am told it's very like your Shropshire.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not in the least like it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Drummle/Bentley Drummle/Mrs. Bentley Drummle</b></font>)</div>said Drummle.

<p/>Here Mr. Drummle looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>Drummle</b></font>) boots and I looked at mine, and then Mr.
Drummle looked at my boots, and I looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>Drummle</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you been here long?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked, determined not to yield an inch of
the fire.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Long enough to be tired of it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Drummle/Bentley Drummle/Mrs. Bentley Drummle</b></font>)</div>returned Drummle, pretending to yawn,
but equally determined.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you stay here long?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Can't say,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Drummle</b></font>)</div>answered Mr. Drummle. <div class="bookquote">``Do you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Can't say,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I.

<p/>I felt here, through a tingling in my blood, that if Mr. Drummle's
shoulder had claimed another hair's breadth of room, I should have
jerked him (<font color='blue'><b>Drummle</b></font>) into the window; equally, that if my own shoulder had urged a
similar claim, Mr. Drummle would have jerked me into the nearest box. He (<font color='blue'><b>Drummle</b></font>)
whistled a little. So did I.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Large tract of marshes about here, I believe?''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said Drummle.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. What of that?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I.

<p/>Mr. Drummle looked at me, and then at my boots, and then said, <div class="bookquote">``Oh!''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>and
laughed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you amused, Mr. Drummle?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Drummle</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``not particularly. I am going out for a ride in the
saddle. I mean to explore those marshes for amusement. Out-of-the-way
villages there, they tell me. Curious little public-houses--and
smithies--and that. Waiter!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is that horse of mine ready?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Brought round to the door, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I say. Look here, you sir. The lady won't ride to-day; the weather
won't do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very good, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And I don't dine, because I'm going to dine at the lady's.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very good, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Drummle/Bentley Drummle/Mrs. Bentley Drummle</b></font>)</div><p/>Then, Drummle glanced at me, with an insolent triumph on his (<font color='blue'><b>Drummle</b></font>)
great-jowled face that cut me to the heart, dull as he (<font color='blue'><b>Drummle</b></font>) was, and so
exasperated me, that I felt inclined to take him (<font color='blue'><b>Drummle</b></font>) in my arms -LRB-as the
robber in the story-book is said to have taken the old lady-RRB- and seat
him (<font color='blue'><b>robber</b></font>) on the fire.

<p/>One thing was manifest to both of us, and that was, that until relief
came, neither of us could relinquish the fire. There we stood, well
squared up before it, shoulder to shoulder and foot to foot, with our
hands behind us, not budging an inch. The horse was visible outside in
the drizzle at the door, my breakfast was put on the table, Drummle's
was cleared away, the waiter invited me to begin, I nodded, we both
stood our ground.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you been to the Grove since?''  (<font color='red'><b>Drummle/Bentley Drummle/Mrs. Bentley Drummle</b></font>)</div>said Drummle.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, <div class="bookquote">``I had quite enough of the Finches the last time I was
there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Was that when we had a difference of opinion?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I replied, very shortly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, come! They let you off easily enough,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>sneered Drummle. <div class="bookquote">``You
shouldn't have lost your temper.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Drummle,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, <div class="bookquote">``you are not competent to give advice on that
subject. When I lose my temper -LRB-not that I admit having done so on that
occasion-RRB-, I don't throw glasses.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do,''  (<font color='red'><b>Drummle/Bentley Drummle/Mrs. Bentley Drummle</b></font>)</div>said Drummle.

<p/>After glancing at him (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) once or twice, in an increased state of
smouldering ferocity, I said,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Drummle, I did not seek this conversation, and I don't think it an
agreeable one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sure it's not,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>), superciliously over his (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) shoulder; <div class="bookquote">``I
don't think anything about it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And therefore,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I went on, <div class="bookquote">``with your leave, I will suggest that we
hold no kind of communication in future.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Quite my opinion,''  (<font color='red'><b>Drummle/Bentley Drummle/Mrs. Bentley Drummle</b></font>)</div>said Drummle, <div class="bookquote">``and what I should have suggested
myself, or done--more likely--without suggesting. But don't lose your
temper. Haven't you lost enough without that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Drummle/Bentley Drummle/Mrs. Bentley Drummle</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you mean, sir?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Waiter!''  (<font color='red'><b>Drummle/Bentley Drummle/Mrs. Bentley Drummle</b></font>)</div>said Drummle, by way of answering me.

<p/>The waiter reappeared.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Look here, you sir. You quite understand that the young lady don't ride
to-day, and that I dine at the young lady's?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Quite so, sir!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the waiter</b></font>)</div><p/>When the waiter had felt my fast-cooling teapot with the palm of his (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>)
hand, and had looked imploringly at me, and had gone out, Drummle,
careful not to move the shoulder next me, took a cigar from his (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) pocket
and bit the end off, but showed no sign of stirring. Choking and
boiling as I was, I felt that we could not go a word further, without
introducing Estella's name, which I could not endure to hear him (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) utter;
and therefore I looked stonily at the opposite wall, as if there were
no one present, and forced myself to silence. How long we might have
remained in this ridiculous position it is impossible to say, but
for the incursion of three thriving farmers--laid on by the waiter, I
think--who came into the coffee-room unbuttoning their great-coats and
rubbing their hands, and before whom, as they charged at the fire, we
were obliged to give way.

<p/>I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) through the window, seizing his (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) horse's mane, and mounting in
his (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) blundering brutal manner, and sidling and backing away. I thought
he (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) was gone, when he (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) came back, calling for a light for the cigar in his (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>)
mouth, which he (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) had forgotten. A man in a dust-colored dress appeared
with what was wanted,--I could not have said from where: whether from
the inn yard, or the street, or where not,--and as Drummle leaned down
from the saddle and lighted his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cigar and laughed, with a jerk of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
head towards the coffee-room windows, the slouching shoulders and ragged
hair of this man whose back was towards me reminded me of Orlick.

<p/>Too heavily out of sorts to care much at the time whether it were he (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) or
no, or after all to touch the breakfast, I washed the weather and the
journey from my face and hands, and went out to the memorable old house
that it would have been so much the better for me never to have entered,
never to have seen.




<p/>Chapter XLIV

<p/>In the room where the dressing-table stood, and where the wax-candles
burnt on the wall, I found Miss Havisham and Estella; Miss Havisham
seated on a settee near the fire, and Estella on a cushion at her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) feet.
Estella was knitting, and Miss Havisham was looking on. They both raised
their eyes as I went in, and both saw an alteration in me. I derived
that, from the look they interchanged.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And what wind,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Havisham</b></font>)</div>said Miss Havisham, <div class="bookquote">``blows you here, Pip?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Havisham</b></font>)</div><p/>Though she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) looked steadily at me, I saw that she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) was rather confused.
Estella, pausing a moment in her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) knitting with her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) eyes upon me, and
then going on, I fancied that I read in the action of her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) fingers, as
plainly as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) had told me in the dumb alphabet, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) perceived I
had discovered my real benefactor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Havisham,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, <div class="bookquote">``I went to Richmond yesterday, to speak to
Estella; and finding that some wind had blown her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) here, I followed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Havisham motioning to me for the third or fourth time to sit down,
I took the chair by the dressing-table, which I had often seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>)
occupy. With all that ruin at my feet and about me, it seemed a natural
place for me, that day.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What I had to say to Estella, Miss Havisham, I will say before you,
presently--in a few moments. It will not surprise you, it will not
displease you. I am as unhappy as you can ever have meant me to be.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Havisham</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Havisham continued to look steadily at me. I could see in the
action of Estella's fingers as they worked that she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) attended to what I
said; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) did not look up.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have found out who my patron is. It is not a fortunate discovery,
and is not likely ever to enrich me in reputation, station, fortune,
anything. There are reasons why I must say no more of that. It is not my
secret, but another's.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>As I was silent for a while, looking at Estella and considering how to
go on, Miss Havisham repeated, <div class="bookquote">``It is not your secret, but another's.
Well?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Estella</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``When you first caused me to be brought here, Miss Havisham, when I
belonged to the village over yonder, that I wish I had never left,
I suppose I did really come here, as any other chance boy might have
come,--as a kind of servant, to gratify a want or a whim, and to be paid
for it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, Pip,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Havisham</b></font>)</div>replied Miss Havisham, steadily nodding her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) head; <div class="bookquote">``you did.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Havisham</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And that Mr. Jaggers--''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Jaggers,''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>said Miss Havisham, taking me up in a firm tone, <div class="bookquote">``had
nothing to do with it, and knew nothing of it. His (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) being my lawyer, and
his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) being the lawyer of your patron is a coincidence. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) holds the same
relation towards numbers of people, and it might easily arise. Be that
as it may, it did arise, and was not brought about by any one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>Any one might have seen in her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) haggard face that there was no
suppression or evasion so far.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But when I fell into the mistake I have so long remained in, at least
you led me on?''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) returned, again nodding steadily, <div class="bookquote">``I let you go on.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Was that kind?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who am I,''  (<font color='red'><b>Estella/Miss Estella/ESTELLA</b></font>)</div>cried Miss Havisham, striking her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) stick upon the floor
and flashing into wrath so suddenly that Estella glanced up at her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) in
surprise,--<div class="bookquote">``who am I, for God's sake, that I should be kind?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Estella/Miss Estella/ESTELLA</b></font>)</div><p/>It was a weak complaint to have made, and I had not meant to make it. I
told her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) so, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) sat brooding after this outburst.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, well, well!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``What else?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I was liberally paid for my old attendance here,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said, to soothe
her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``in being apprenticed, and I have asked these questions only for
my own information. What follows has another -LRB-and I hope more
disinterested-RRB- purpose. In humoring my mistake, Miss Havisham, you
punished--practised on--perhaps you will supply whatever term expresses
your intention, without offence--your self-seeking relations?''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I did. Why, they would have it so! So would you. What has been my
history, that I should be at the pains of entreating either them or you
not to have it so! You made your own snares. I never made them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Waiting until she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) was quiet again,--for this, too, flashed out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) in
a wild and sudden way,--I went on.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have been thrown among one family of your relations, Miss Havisham,
and have been constantly among them since I went to London. I know them
to have been as honestly under my delusion as I myself. And I should be
false and base if I did not tell you, whether it is acceptable to you or
no, and whether you are inclined to give credence to it or no, that you
deeply wrong both Mr. Matthew Pocket and his (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) son Herbert, if you suppose
them to be otherwise than generous, upright, open, and incapable of
anything designing or mean.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They are your friends,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Miss Havisham.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They made themselves my friends,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, <div class="bookquote">``when they supposed me
to have superseded them; and when Sarah Pocket, Miss Georgiana, and
Mistress Camilla were not my friends, I think.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>This contrasting of them with the rest seemed, I was glad to see, to do
them good with her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) looked at me keenly for a little while, and then
said quietly,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you want for them?''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Only,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, <div class="bookquote">``that you would not confound them with the others. They
may be of the same blood, but, believe me, they are not of the same
nature.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Still looking at me keenly, Miss Havisham repeated,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you want for them?''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not so cunning, you see,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said, in answer, conscious that I
reddened a little, <div class="bookquote">``as that I could hide from you, even if I desired,
that I do want something. Miss Havisham, if you would spare the money
to do my friend Herbert a lasting service in life, but which from the
nature of the case must be done without his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) knowledge, I could show you
how.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why must it be done without his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) knowledge?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) asked, settling her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>)
hands upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) stick, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) might regard me the more attentively.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Because,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, <div class="bookquote">``I began the service myself, more than two years ago,
without his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) knowledge, and I don't want to be betrayed. Why I fail in my
ability to finish it, I cannot explain. It is a part of the secret which
is another person's and not mine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) gradually withdrew her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) eyes from me, and turned them on the fire.
After watching it for what appeared in the silence and by the light
of the slowly wasting candles to be a long time, she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) was roused by
the collapse of some of the red coals, and looked towards me again--at
first, vacantly--then, with a gradually concentrating attention. All
this time Estella knitted on. When Miss Havisham had fixed her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>)
attention on me, she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) said, speaking as if there had been no lapse in our
dialogue,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What else?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Estella,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, turning to her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) now, and trying to command my
trembling voice, <div class="bookquote">``you know I love you. You know that I have loved you
long and dearly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) raised her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) eyes to my face, on being thus addressed, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) fingers
plied their work, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) looked at me with an unmoved countenance. I
saw that Miss Havisham glanced from me to her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>), and from her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) to me.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I should have said this sooner, but for my long mistake. It induced me
to hope that Miss Havisham meant us for one another. While I thought you
could not help yourself, as it were, I refrained from saying it. But I
must say it now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Estella/Miss Estella/ESTELLA</b></font>)</div><p/>Preserving her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) unmoved countenance, and with her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) fingers still going,
Estella shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) head.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I know,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, in answer to that action,--<div class="bookquote">``I know. I have no hope
that I shall ever call you mine, Estella. I am ignorant what may become
of me very soon, how poor I may be, or where I may go. Still, I love
you. I have loved you ever since I first saw you in this house.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Looking at me perfectly unmoved and with her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) fingers busy, she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>)
head again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It would have been cruel in Miss Havisham, horribly cruel, to practise
on the susceptibility of a poor boy, and to torture me through all these
years with a vain hope and an idle pursuit, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) had reflected on the
gravity of what she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) did. But I think she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) did not. I think that, in the
endurance of her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) own trial, she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) forgot mine, Estella.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I saw Miss Havisham put her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) hand to her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) heart and hold it there, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>)
sat looking by turns at Estella and at me.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It seems,''  (<font color='red'><b>Estella/Miss Estella/ESTELLA</b></font>)</div>said Estella, very calmly, <div class="bookquote">``that there are sentiments,
fancies,--I don't know how to call them,--which I am not able to
comprehend. When you say you love me, I know what you mean, as a form
of words; but nothing more. You address nothing in my breast, you touch
nothing there. I don't care for what you say at all. I have tried to
warn you of this; now, have I not?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Estella/Miss Estella/ESTELLA</b></font>)</div><p/>I said in a miserable manner, <div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. But you would not be warned, for you thought I did not mean it.
Now, did you not think so?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought and hoped you could not mean it. You, so young, untried, and
beautiful, Estella! Surely it is not in Nature.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is in my nature,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) returned. And then she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) added, with a stress
upon the words, <div class="bookquote">``It is in the nature formed within me. I make a great
difference between you and all other people when I say so much. I can do
no more.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it not true,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, <div class="bookquote">``that Bentley Drummle is in town here, and
pursuing you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is quite true,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) replied, referring to him (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) with the indifference
of utter contempt.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That you encourage him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>), and ride out with him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>), and that he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) dines with
you this very day?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) seemed a little surprised that I should know it, but again replied,
<div class="bookquote">``Quite true.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You cannot love him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>), Estella!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) fingers stopped for the first time, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) retorted rather angrily,
<div class="bookquote">``What have I told you? Do you still think, in spite of it, that I do not
mean what I say?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You would never marry him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>), Estella?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) looked towards Miss Havisham, and considered for a moment with her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>)
work in her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) hands. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Why not tell you the truth? I am
going to be married to him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>I dropped my face into my hands, but was able to control myself better
than I could have expected, considering what agony it gave me to hear
her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) say those words. When I raised my face again, there was such a
ghastly look upon Miss Havisham's, that it impressed me, even in my
passionate hurry and grief.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Estella, dearest Estella, do not let Miss Havisham lead you into this
fatal step. Put me aside for ever,--you have done so, I well know,--but
bestow yourself on some worthier person than Drummle. Miss Havisham
gives you to him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>), as the greatest slight and injury that could be done
to the many far better men who admire you, and to the few who truly
love you. Among those few there may be one who loves you even as dearly,
though he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) has not loved you as long, as I. Take him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>), and I can bear it
better, for your sake!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>My earnestness awoke a wonder in her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) that seemed as if it would have
been touched with compassion, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) could have rendered me at all
intelligible to her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) own mind.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am going,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) said again, in a gentler voice, <div class="bookquote">``to be married to
him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>). The preparations for my marriage are making, and I shall be
married soon. Why do you injuriously introduce the name of my mother by
adoption? It is my own act.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Your own act, Estella, to fling yourself away upon a brute?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``On whom should I fling myself away?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) retorted, with a smile.
<div class="bookquote">``Should I fling myself away upon the man who would the soonest feel -LRB-if
people do feel such things-RRB- that I took nothing to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)? There! It is
done. I shall do well enough, and so will my husband. As to leading
me into what you call this fatal step, Miss Havisham would have had me
wait, and not marry yet; but I am tired of the life I have led, which
has very few charms for me, and I am willing enough to change it. Say no
more. We shall never understand each other.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Such a mean brute, such a stupid brute!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I urged, in despair.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't be afraid of my being a blessing to him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Estella/Miss Estella/ESTELLA</b></font>)</div>said Estella; <div class="bookquote">``I shall
not be that. Come! Here is my hand. Do we part on this, you visionary
boy--or man?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Estella/Miss Estella/ESTELLA</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``O Estella!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I answered, as my bitter tears fell fast on her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) hand, do
what I would to restrain them; <div class="bookquote">``even if I remained in England and could
hold my head up with the rest, how could I see you Drummle's wife?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nonsense,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) returned,--<div class="bookquote">``nonsense. This will pass in no time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never, Estella!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You will get me out of your thoughts in a week.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Out of my thoughts! You are part of my existence, part of myself. You
have been in every line I have ever read since I first came here, the
rough common boy whose poor heart you wounded even then. You have been
in every prospect I have ever seen since,--on the river, on the sails of
the ships, on the marshes, in the clouds, in the light, in the darkness,
in the wind, in the woods, in the sea, in the streets. You have been
the embodiment of every graceful fancy that my mind has ever become
acquainted with. The stones of which the strongest London buildings
are made are not more real, or more impossible to be displaced by your
hands, than your presence and influence have been to me, there and
everywhere, and will be. Estella, to the last hour of my life, you
cannot choose but remain part of my character, part of the little good
in me, part of the evil. But, in this separation, I associate you only
with the good; and I will faithfully hold you to that always, for you
must have done me far more good than harm, let me feel now what sharp
distress I may. O God bless you, God forgive you!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>In what ecstasy of unhappiness I got these broken words out of myself, I
don't know. The rhapsody welled up within me, like blood from an
inward wound, and gushed out. I held her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) hand to my lips some lingering
moments, and so I left her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>). But ever afterwards, I remembered,--and soon
afterwards with stronger reason,--that while Estella looked at me merely
with incredulous wonder, the spectral figure of Miss Havisham, her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) hand
still covering her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) heart, seemed all resolved into a ghastly stare of
pity and remorse.

<p/>All done, all gone! So much was done and gone, that when I went out at
the gate, the light of the day seemed of a darker color than when I went
in. For a while, I hid myself among some lanes and by-paths, and then
struck off to walk all the way to London. For, I had by that time come
to myself so far as to consider that I could not go back to the inn and
see Drummle there; that I could not bear to sit upon the coach and
be spoken to; that I could do nothing half so good for myself as tire
myself out.

<p/>It was past midnight when I crossed London Bridge. Pursuing the narrow
intricacies of the streets which at that time tended westward near the
Middlesex shore of the river, my readiest access to the Temple was
close by the river-side, through Whitefriars. I was not expected till
to-morrow; but I had my keys, and, if Herbert were gone to bed, could
get to bed myself without disturbing him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>).

<p/>As it seldom happened that I came in at that Whitefriars gate after the
Temple was closed, and as I was very muddy and weary, I did not take it
ill that the night-porter examined me with much attention as he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) held the
gate a little way open for me to pass in. To help his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) memory I mentioned
my name.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I was not quite sure, sir, but I thought so. Here's a note, sir. The
messenger that brought it, said would you be so good as read it by my
lantern?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Much surprised by the request, I took the note. It was directed to
Philip Pip, Esquire, and on the top of the superscription were the
words, <div class="bookquote">``PLEASE READ THIS, HERE.''  (<font color='red'><b>Esquire</b></font>)</div>I opened it, the watchman holding up
his (<font color='blue'><b>watchman</b></font>) light, and read inside, in Wemmick's writing,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``DON'T GO HOME.''




 (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div><p/>Chapter XLV

<p/>Turning from the Temple gate as soon as I had read the warning, I made
the best of my way to Fleet Street, and there got a late hackney chariot
and drove to the Hummums in Covent Garden. In those times a bed was
always to be got there at any hour of the night, and the chamberlain,
letting me in at his (<font color='blue'><b>chamberlain</b></font>) ready wicket, lighted the candle next in order on
his (<font color='blue'><b>chamberlain</b></font>) shelf, and showed me straight into the bedroom next in order on his (<font color='blue'><b>chamberlain</b></font>)
list. It was a sort of vault on the ground floor at the back, with a
despotic monster of a four-post bedstead in it, straddling over the
whole place, putting one of his (<font color='blue'><b>chamberlain</b></font>) arbitrary legs into the fireplace
and another into the doorway, and squeezing the wretched little
washing-stand in quite a Divinely Righteous manner.

<p/>As I had asked for a night-light, the chamberlain had brought me in,
before he (<font color='blue'><b>chamberlain</b></font>) left me, the good old constitutional rushlight of those
virtuous days--an object like the ghost of a walking-cane, which
instantly broke its back if it were touched, which nothing could ever be
lighted at, and which was placed in solitary confinement at the bottom
of a high tin tower, perforated with round holes that made a staringly
wide-awake pattern on the walls. When I had got into bed, and lay there
footsore, weary, and wretched, I found that I could no more close my own
eyes than I could close the eyes of this foolish Argus. And thus, in the
gloom and death of the night, we stared at one another.

<p/>What a doleful night! How anxious, how dismal, how long! There was an
inhospitable smell in the room, of cold soot and hot dust; and, as I
looked up into the corners of the tester over my head, I thought what
a number of blue-bottle flies from the butchers', and earwigs from the
market, and grubs from the country, must be holding on up there, lying
by for next summer. This led me to speculate whether any of them ever
tumbled down, and then I fancied that I felt light falls on my face,--a
disagreeable turn of thought, suggesting other and more objectionable
approaches up my back. When I had lain awake a little while, those
extraordinary voices with which silence teems began to make themselves
audible. The closet whispered, the fireplace sighed, the little
washing-stand ticked, and one guitar-string played occasionally in the
chest of drawers. At about the same time, the eyes on the wall acquired
a new expression, and in every one of those staring rounds I saw
written, DON'T GO HOME.

<p/>Whatever night-fancies and night-noises crowded on me, they never warded
off this DON'T GO HOME. It plaited itself into whatever I thought of,
as a bodily pain would have done. Not long before, I had read in the
newspapers, how a gentleman unknown had come to the Hummums in the
night, and had gone to bed, and had destroyed himself, and had been
found in the morning weltering in blood. It came into my head that he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
must have occupied this very vault of mine, and I got out of bed to
assure myself that there were no red marks about; then opened the door
to look out into the passages, and cheer myself with the companionship
of a distant light, near which I knew the chamberlain to be dozing. But
all this time, why I was not to go home, and what had happened at home,
and when I should go home, and whether Provis was safe at home, were
questions occupying my mind so busily, that one might have supposed
there could be no more room in it for any other theme. Even when I
thought of Estella, and how we had parted that day forever, and when
I recalled all the circumstances of our parting, and all her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) looks and
tones, and the action of her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) fingers while she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) knitted,--even then I
was pursuing, here and there and everywhere, the caution, Don't go home.
When at last I dozed, in sheer exhaustion of mind and body, it became
a vast shadowy verb which I had to conjugate. Imperative mood, present
tense: Do not thou go home, let him (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) not go home, let us not go home, do
not ye or you go home, let not them go home. Then potentially: I may not
and I cannot go home; and I might not, could not, would not, and should
not go home; until I felt that I was going distracted, and rolled over
on the pillow, and looked at the staring rounds upon the wall again.

<p/>I had left directions that I was to be called at seven; for it was plain
that I must see Wemmick before seeing any one else, and equally plain
that this was a case in which his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) Walworth sentiments only could be
taken. It was a relief to get out of the room where the night had been
so miserable, and I needed no second knocking at the door to startle me
from my uneasy bed.

<p/>The Castle battlements arose upon my view at eight o’clock. The little
servant happening to be entering the fortress with two hot rolls, I
passed through the postern and crossed the drawbridge in her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) company,
and so came without announcement into the presence of Wemmick as he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) was
making tea for himself and the Aged. An open door afforded a perspective
view of the Aged in bed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Halloa, Mr. Pip!''  (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div>said Wemmick. <div class="bookquote">``You did come home, then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I returned; <div class="bookquote">``but I didn't go home.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's all right,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>), rubbing his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) hands. <div class="bookquote">``I left a note for you
at each of the Temple gates, on the chance. Which gate did you come to?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll go round to the others in the course of the day and destroy the
notes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div>said Wemmick; <div class="bookquote">``it's a good rule never to leave documentary
evidence if you can help it, because you don't know when it may be put
in. I'm going to take a liberty with you. Would you mind toasting this
sausage for the Aged P.?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div><p/>I said I should be delighted to do it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then you can go about your work, Mary Anne,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div>said Wemmick to the little
servant; <div class="bookquote">``which leaves us to ourselves, don't you see, Mr. Pip?''  (<font color='red'><b>the servant</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>)
added, winking, as she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) disappeared.

<p/>I thanked him (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) for his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) friendship and caution, and our discourse
proceeded in a low tone, while I toasted the Aged's sausage and he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>)
buttered the crumb of the Aged's roll.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, Mr. Pip, you know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div>said Wemmick, <div class="bookquote">``you and I understand one
another. We are in our private and personal capacities, and we have been
engaged in a confidential transaction before to-day. Official sentiments
are one thing. We are extra official.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div><p/>I cordially assented. I was so very nervous, that I had already lighted
the Aged's sausage like a torch, and been obliged to blow it out.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I accidentally heard, yesterday morning,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div>said Wemmick, <div class="bookquote">``being in a
certain place where I once took you,--even between you and me, it's as
well not to mention names when avoidable--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Much better not,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div>said I. <div class="bookquote">``I understand you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I heard there by chance, yesterday morning,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div>said Wemmick, <div class="bookquote">``that
a certain person not altogether of uncolonial pursuits, and not
unpossessed of portable property,--I don't know who it may really
be,--we won't name this person--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not necessary,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div>said I.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``--Had made some little stir in a certain part of the world where a good
many people go, not always in gratification of their own inclinations,
and not quite irrespective of the government expense--''

 (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div><p/>In watching his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) face, I made quite a firework of the Aged's sausage,
and greatly discomposed both my own attention and Wemmick's; for which I
apologized.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``--By disappearing from such place, and being no more heard of
thereabouts. From which,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div>said Wemmick, <div class="bookquote">``conjectures had been raised and
theories formed. I also heard that you at your chambers in Garden Court,
Temple, had been watched, and might be watched again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``By whom?''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wouldn't go into that,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said Wemmick, evasively, <div class="bookquote">``it might clash with
official responsibilities. I heard it, as I have in my time heard other
curious things in the same place. I don't tell it you on information
received. I heard it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) took the toasting-fork and sausage from me as he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) spoke, and set forth
the Aged's breakfast neatly on a little tray. Previous to placing it
before him (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) went into the Aged's room with a clean white cloth, and
tied the same under the old gentleman's chin, and propped him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) up, and
put his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) nightcap on one side, and gave him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) quite a rakish air. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
placed his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) breakfast before him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) with great care, and said, <div class="bookquote">``All right,
ain't you, Aged P.?''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>To which the cheerful Aged replied, <div class="bookquote">``All right,
John, my boy, all right!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>As there seemed to be a tacit understanding
that the Aged was not in a presentable state, and was therefore to be
considered invisible, I made a pretence of being in complete ignorance
of these proceedings.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This watching of me at my chambers -LRB-which I have once had reason to
suspect-RRB-,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said to Wemmick when he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) came back, <div class="bookquote">``is inseparable from the
person to whom you have adverted; is it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Wemmick looked very serious. <div class="bookquote">``I couldn't undertake to say that, of my
own knowledge. I mean, I couldn't undertake to say it was at first. But
it either is, or it will be, or it's in great danger of being.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>As I saw that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) was restrained by fealty to Little Britain from saying
as much as he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) could, and as I knew with thankfulness to him (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) how far out
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) way he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) went to say what he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) did, I could not press him (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>). But I told
him (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>), after a little meditation over the fire, that I would like to ask
him (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) a question, subject to his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) answering or not answering, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>)
deemed right, and sure that his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) course would be right. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) paused in his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>)
breakfast, and crossing his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) arms, and pinching his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) shirt-sleeves -LRB-his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>)
notion of in-door comfort was to sit without any coat-RRB-, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) nodded to me
once, to put my question.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You have heard of a man of bad character, whose true name is
Compeyson?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) answered with one other nod.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) living?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>One other nod.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) in London?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) gave me one other nod, compressed the post-office exceedingly, gave
me one last nod, and went on with his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) breakfast.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div>said Wemmick, <div class="bookquote">``questioning being over,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div>which he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) emphasized and
repeated for my guidance, <div class="bookquote">``I come to what I did, after hearing what I
heard. I went to Garden Court to find you; not finding you, I went to
Clarriker's to find Mr. Herbert.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) you found?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, with great anxiety.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) I found. Without mentioning any names or going into any
details, I gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) to understand that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) was aware of anybody--Tom,
Jack, or Richard--being about the chambers, or about the immediate
neighborhood, he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) had better get Tom, Jack, or Richard out of the way
while you were out of the way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) would be greatly puzzled what to do?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) was puzzled what to do; not the less, because I gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) my opinion
that it was not safe to try to get Tom, Jack, or Richard too far out
of the way at present. Mr. Pip, I'll tell you something. Under existing
circumstances, there is no place like a great city when you are once
in it. Don't break cover too soon. Lie close. Wait till things slacken,
before you try the open, even for foreign air.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I thanked him (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) for his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) valuable advice, and asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) what Herbert had
done?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Herbert,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div>said Wemmick, <div class="bookquote">``after being all of a heap for half an
hour, struck out a plan. He (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) mentioned to me as a secret, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) is
courting a young lady who has, as no doubt you are aware, a bedridden
Pa.. Which Pa, having been in the Purser line of life, lies a-bed in a
bow-window where he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) can see the ships sail up and down the river. You
are acquainted with the young lady, most probably?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not personally,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I.

<p/>The truth was, that she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) had objected to me as an expensive companion
who did Herbert no good, and that, when Herbert had first proposed to
present me to her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) had received the proposal with such very moderate
warmth, that Herbert had felt himself obliged to confide the state of
the case to me, with a view to the lapse of a little time before I made
her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) acquaintance. When I had begun to advance Herbert's prospects by
stealth, I had been able to bear this with cheerful philosophy: he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) and
his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) affianced, for their part, had naturally not been very anxious to
introduce a third person into their interviews; and thus, although I was
assured that I had risen in Clara's esteem, and although the young
lady and I had long regularly interchanged messages and remembrances by
Herbert, I had never seen her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>). However, I did not trouble Wemmick with
these particulars.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The house with the bow-window,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div>said Wemmick, <div class="bookquote">``being by the river-side,
down the Pool there between Limehouse and Greenwich, and being kept, it
seems, by a very respectable widow who has a furnished upper floor to
let, Mr. Herbert put it to me, what did I think of that as a temporary
tenement for Tom, Jack, or Richard? Now, I thought very well of it, for
three reasons I'll give you. That is to say: Firstly. It's altogether
out of all your beats, and is well away from the usual heap of streets
great and small. Secondly. Without going near it yourself, you could
always hear of the safety of Tom, Jack, or Richard, through Mr. Herbert.
Thirdly. After a while and when it might be prudent, if you should want
to slip Tom, Jack, or Richard on board a foreign packet-boat, there he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>)
is--ready.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div><p/>Much comforted by these considerations, I thanked Wemmick again and
again, and begged him (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) to proceed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, sir! Mr. Herbert threw himself into the business with a will, and
by nine o’clock last night he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) housed Tom, Jack, or Richard,--whichever
it may be,--you and I don't want to know,--quite successfully. At the
old lodgings it was understood that he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) was summoned to Dover, and, in
fact, he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) was taken down the Dover road and cornered out of it. Now,
another great advantage of all this is, that it was done without you,
and when, if any one was concerning himself about your movements, you
must be known to be ever so many miles off and quite otherwise engaged.
This diverts suspicion and confuses it; and for the same reason I
recommended that, even if you came back last night, you should not go
home. It brings in more confusion, and you want confusion.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div><p/>Wemmick, having finished his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) breakfast, here looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) watch, and
began to get his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) coat on.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And now, Mr. Pip,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>), with his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) hands still in the sleeves, <div class="bookquote">``I
have probably done the most I can do; but if I can ever do more,--from
a Walworth point of view, and in a strictly private and personal
capacity,--I shall be glad to do it. Here's the address. There can be
no harm in your going here to-night, and seeing for yourself that all is
well with Tom, Jack, or Richard, before you go home,--which is another
reason for your not going home last night. But, after you have gone
home, don't go back here. You are very welcome, I am sure, Mr. Pip'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>; his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>)
hands were now out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) sleeves, and I was shaking them; <div class="bookquote">``and let me
finally impress one important point upon you.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) laid his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) hands upon
my shoulders, and added in a solemn whisper: <div class="bookquote">``Avail yourself of this
evening to lay hold of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) portable property. You don't know what may
happen to him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>). Don't let anything happen to the portable property.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>Quite despairing of making my mind clear to Wemmick on this point, I
forbore to try.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Time's up,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div>said Wemmick, <div class="bookquote">``and I must be off. If you had nothing more
pressing to do than to keep here till dark, that's what I should advise.
You look very much worried, and it would do you good to have a perfectly
quiet day with the Aged,--he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>)'ll be up presently,--and a little bit
of--you remember the pig?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well; and a little bit of him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>). That sausage you toasted was his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>), and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) was in all respects a first-rater. Do try him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>), if it is only for old
acquaintance sake. Good-bye, Aged Parent!''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>in a cheery shout.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``All right, John; all right, my boy!''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>piped the old man from within.

<p/>I soon fell asleep before Wemmick's fire, and the Aged and I enjoyed one
another's society by falling asleep before it more or less all day.
We had loin of pork for dinner, and greens grown on the estate; and
I nodded at the Aged with a good intention whenever I failed to do it
drowsily. When it was quite dark, I left the Aged preparing the fire for
toast; and I inferred from the number of teacups, as well as from his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>)
glances at the two little doors in the wall, that Miss Skiffins was
expected.




<p/>Chapter XLVI

<p/>Eight o’clock had struck before I got into the air, that was scented,
not disagreeably, by the chips and shavings of the long-shore
boat-builders, and mast, oar, and block makers. All that water-side
region of the upper and lower Pool below Bridge was unknown ground to
me; and when I struck down by the river, I found that the spot I wanted
was not where I had supposed it to be, and was anything but easy to
find. It was called Mill Pond Bank, Chinks's Basin; and I had no other
guide to Chinks's Basin than the Old Green Copper Rope-walk.

<p/>It matters not what stranded ships repairing in dry docks I lost myself
among, what old hulls of ships in course of being knocked to pieces,
what ooze and slime and other dregs of tide, what yards of ship-builders
and ship-breakers, what rusty anchors blindly biting into the ground,
though for years off duty, what mountainous country of accumulated casks
and timber, how many rope-walks that were not the Old Green Copper. After
several times falling short of my destination and as often overshooting
it, I came unexpectedly round a corner, upon Mill Pond Bank. It was a
fresh kind of place, all circumstances considered, where the wind from
the river had room to turn itself round; and there were two or three
trees in it, and there was the stump of a ruined windmill, and there
was the Old Green Copper Rope-walk,--whose long and narrow vista I could
trace in the moonlight, along a series of wooden frames set in the
ground, that looked like superannuated haymaking-rakes which had grown
old and lost most of their teeth.

<p/>Selecting from the few queer houses upon Mill Pond Bank a house with a
wooden front and three stories of bow-window -LRB-not bay-window, which is
another thing-RRB-, I looked at the plate upon the door, and read there,
Mrs. Whimple. That being the name I wanted, I knocked, and an elderly
woman of a pleasant and thriving appearance responded. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was
immediately deposed, however, by Herbert, who silently led me into
the parlor and shut the door. It was an odd sensation to see his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) very
familiar face established quite at home in that very unfamiliar room
and region; and I found myself looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>), much as I looked at
the corner-cupboard with the glass and china, the shells upon the
chimney-piece, and the colored engravings on the wall, representing the
death of Captain Cook, a ship-launch, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Cook</b></font>) Majesty King George the
Third in a state coachman's wig, leather-breeches, and top-boots, on the
terrace at Windsor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``All is well, Handel,''  (<font color='red'><b>Herbert/Herbert Pocket</b></font>)</div>said Herbert, <div class="bookquote">``and he (<font color='blue'><b>Handel</b></font>) is quite satisfied, though
eager to see you. My dear girl is with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) father; and if you'll wait
till she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) comes down, I'll make you known to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), and then we'll go upstairs.
That's her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) father.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Herbert/Herbert Pocket</b></font>)</div><p/>I had become aware of an alarming growling overhead, and had probably
expressed the fact in my countenance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am afraid he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) is a sad old rascal,''  (<font color='red'><b>Herbert/Herbert Pocket</b></font>)</div>said Herbert, smiling, <div class="bookquote">``but I have
never seen him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). Don't you smell rum? He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) is always at it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Herbert/Herbert Pocket</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``At rum?''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>returned Herbert, <div class="bookquote">``and you may suppose how mild it makes his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
gout. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) persists, too, in keeping all the provisions upstairs in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
room, and serving them out. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) keeps them on shelves over his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) head, and
will weigh them all. His (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) room must be like a chandler's shop.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Herbert/Herbert Pocket</b></font>)</div><p/>While he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) thus spoke, the growling noise became a prolonged roar, and
then died away.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What else can be the consequence,''  (<font color='red'><b>Herbert/Herbert Pocket</b></font>)</div>said Herbert, in explanation, <div class="bookquote">``if
he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) will cut the cheese? A man with the gout in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) right hand--and
everywhere else--can't expect to get through a Double Gloucester without
hurting himself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Herbert/Herbert Pocket</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) seemed to have hurt himself very much, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) gave another furious
roar.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``To have Provis for an upper lodger is quite a godsend to Mrs. Whimple,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Herbert/Herbert Pocket</b></font>)</div>said Herbert, <div class="bookquote">``for of course people in general won't stand that noise. A
curious place, Handel; isn't it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Herbert/Herbert Pocket</b></font>)</div><p/>It was a curious place, indeed; but remarkably well kept and clean.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Whimple,''  (<font color='red'><b>Herbert/Herbert Pocket</b></font>)</div>said Herbert, when I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) so, <div class="bookquote">``is the best of
housewives, and I really do not know what my Clara would do without
her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) motherly help. For, Clara has no mother of her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) own, Handel, and no
relation in the world but old Gruffandgrim.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Surely that's not his (<font color='blue'><b>Handel</b></font>) name, Herbert?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no,''  (<font color='red'><b>Herbert/Herbert Pocket</b></font>)</div>said Herbert, <div class="bookquote">``that's my name for him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>). His (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) name is Mr. Barley.
But what a blessing it is for the son of my father and mother to love a
girl who has no relations, and who can never bother herself or anybody
else about her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) family!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Herbert/Herbert Pocket</b></font>)</div><p/>Herbert had told me on former occasions, and now reminded me, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>)
first knew Miss Clara Barley when she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) was completing her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) education at
an establishment at Hammersmith, and that on her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) being recalled home
to nurse her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) father, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) and she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) had confided their affection to the
motherly Mrs. Whimple, by whom it had been fostered and regulated
with equal kindness and discretion, ever since. It was understood that
nothing of a tender nature could possibly be confided to old Barley, by
reason of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) being totally unequal to the consideration of any subject
more psychological than Gout, Rum, and Purser's stores.

<p/>As we were thus conversing in a low tone while Old Barley's sustained
growl vibrated in the beam that crossed the ceiling, the room door
opened, and a very pretty, slight, dark-eyed girl of twenty or so came
in with a basket in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) hand: whom Herbert tenderly relieved of the
basket, and presented, blushing, as <div class="bookquote">``Clara.''  (<font color='red'><b>Herbert/Herbert Pocket</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) really was a most
charming girl, and might have passed for a captive fairy, whom that
truculent Ogre, Old Barley, had pressed into his (<font color='blue'><b>Ogre</b></font>) service.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Look here,''  (<font color='red'><b>Herbert/Herbert Pocket</b></font>)</div>said Herbert, showing me the basket, with a compassionate
and tender smile, after we had talked a little; <div class="bookquote">``here's poor Clara's
supper, served out every night. Here's her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) allowance of bread, and
here's her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) slice of cheese, and here's her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) rum,--which I drink. This
is Mr. Barley's breakfast for to-morrow, served out to be cooked. Two
mutton-chops, three potatoes, some split peas, a little flour, two
ounces of butter, a pinch of salt, and all this black pepper. It's
stewed up together, and taken hot, and it's a nice thing for the gout, I
should think!''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>There was something so natural and winning in Clara's resigned way of
looking at these stores in detail, as Herbert pointed them out; and
something so confiding, loving, and innocent in her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) modest manner of
yielding herself to Herbert's embracing arm; and something so gentle in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>), so much needing protection on Mill Pond Bank, by Chinks's Basin,
and the Old Green Copper Rope-walk, with Old Barley growling in the
beam,--that I would not have undone the engagement between her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) and
Herbert for all the money in the pocket-book I had never opened.

<p/>I was looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) with pleasure and admiration, when suddenly the
growl swelled into a roar again, and a frightful bumping noise was heard
above, as if a giant with a wooden leg were trying to bore it through
the ceiling to come at us. Upon this Clara said to Herbert, <div class="bookquote">``Papa wants
me, darling!''  (<font color='red'><b>Herbert/Herbert Pocket</b></font>)</div>and ran away.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There is an unconscionable old shark for you!''  (<font color='red'><b>Herbert/Herbert Pocket</b></font>)</div>said Herbert. <div class="bookquote">``What do
you suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>) wants now, Handel?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I. <div class="bookquote">``Something to drink?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's it!''  (<font color='red'><b>Herbert/Herbert Pocket</b></font>)</div>cried Herbert, as if I had made a guess of extraordinary
merit. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>) keeps his (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>) grog ready mixed in a little tub on the table.
Wait a moment, and you'll hear Clara lift him (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>) up to take some. There
he (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>) goes!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Another roar, with a prolonged shake at the end. <div class="bookquote">``Now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Herbert/Herbert Pocket</b></font>)</div>said
Herbert, as it was succeeded by silence, <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>)'s drinking. Now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Herbert/Herbert Pocket</b></font>)</div>said
Herbert, as the growl resounded in the beam once more, <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>)'s down again
on his (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>) back!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Herbert/Herbert Pocket</b></font>)</div><p/>Clara returned soon afterwards, and Herbert accompanied me upstairs to
see our charge. As we passed Mr. Barley's door, he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) was heard hoarsely
muttering within, in a strain that rose and fell like wind, the
following Refrain, in which I substitute good wishes for something quite
the reverse:--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ahoy! Bless your eyes, here's old Bill Barley. Here's old Bill Barley,
bless your eyes. Here's old Bill Barley on the flat of his (<font color='blue'><b>Barley</b></font>) back, by the
Lord. Lying on the flat of his (<font color='blue'><b>Barley</b></font>) back like a drifting old dead flounder,
here's your old Bill Barley, bless your eyes. Ahoy! Bless you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>In this strain of consolation, Herbert informed me the invisible Barley
would commune with himself by the day and night together; Often, while
it was light, having, at the same time, one eye at a telescope which was
fitted on his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) bed for the convenience of sweeping the river.

<p/>In his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) two cabin rooms at the top of the house, which were fresh and
airy, and in which Mr. Barley was less audible than below, I found
Provis comfortably settled. He (<font color='blue'><b>Barley</b></font>) expressed no alarm, and seemed to
feel none that was worth mentioning; but it struck me that he (<font color='blue'><b>Barley</b></font>) was
softened,--indefinably, for I could not have said how, and could never
afterwards recall how when I tried, but certainly.

<p/>The opportunity that the day's rest had given me for reflection had
resulted in my fully determining to say nothing to him (<font color='blue'><b>Barley</b></font>) respecting
Compeyson. For anything I knew, his (<font color='blue'><b>Barley</b></font>) animosity towards the man
might otherwise lead to his (<font color='blue'><b>Barley</b></font>) seeking him (<font color='blue'><b>Barley</b></font>) out and rushing on his (<font color='blue'><b>Barley</b></font>) own
destruction. Therefore, when Herbert and I sat down with him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) by his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>)
fire, I asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) first of all whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) relied on Wemmick's judgment
and sources of information?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, ay, dear boy!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) answered, with a grave nod, <div class="bookquote">``Jaggers knows.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then, I have talked with Wemmick,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, <div class="bookquote">``and have come to tell you
what caution he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) gave me and what advice.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>This I did accurately, with the reservation just mentioned; and I told
him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) how Wemmick had heard, in Newgate prison -LRB-whether from officers or
prisoners I could not say-RRB-, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) was under some suspicion, and that
my chambers had been watched; how Wemmick had recommended his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) keeping
close for a time, and my keeping away from him (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>); and what Wemmick had
said about getting him (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) abroad. I added, that of course, when the time
came, I should go with him (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>), or should follow close upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>), as might
be safest in Wemmick's judgment. What was to follow that I did not touch
upon; neither, indeed, was I at all clear or comfortable about it in my
own mind, now that I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) in that softer condition, and in declared
peril for my sake. As to altering my way of living by enlarging my
expenses, I put it to him (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) whether in our present unsettled and difficult
circumstances, it would not be simply ridiculous, if it were no worse?

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) could not deny this, and indeed was very reasonable throughout. His (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>)
coming back was a venture, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) said, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) had always known it to be a
venture. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) would do nothing to make it a desperate venture, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) had
very little fear of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) safety with such good help.

<p/>Herbert, who had been looking at the fire and pondering, here said
that something had come into his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) thoughts arising out of Wemmick's
suggestion, which it might be worth while to pursue. <div class="bookquote">``We are both good
watermen, Handel, and could take him (<font color='blue'><b>Handel</b></font>) down the river ourselves when the
right time comes. No boat would then be hired for the purpose, and no
boatmen; that would save at least a chance of suspicion, and any chance
is worth saving. Never mind the season; don't you think it might be a
good thing if you began at once to keep a boat at the Temple stairs, and
were in the habit of rowing up and down the river? You fall into that
habit, and then who notices or minds? Do it twenty or fifty times,
and there is nothing special in your doing it the twenty-first or
fifty-first.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I liked this scheme, and Provis was quite elated by it. We agreed
that it should be carried into execution, and that Provis should never
recognize us if we came below Bridge, and rowed past Mill Pond Bank. But
we further agreed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Provis</b></font>) should pull down the blind in that part of his (<font color='blue'><b>Provis</b></font>)
window which gave upon the east, whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>Provis</b></font>) saw us and all was right.

<p/>Our conference being now ended, and everything arranged, I rose to go;
remarking to Herbert that he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) and I had better not go home together, and
that I would take half an hour's start of him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I don't like to leave
you here,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said to Provis, <div class="bookquote">``though I cannot doubt your being safer
here than near me. Good-bye!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Provis/Mr. Provis</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear boy,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Provis</b></font>) answered, clasping my hands, <div class="bookquote">``I don't know when we may
meet again, and I don't like good-bye. Say good night!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good night! Herbert will go regularly between us, and when the time
comes you may be certain I shall be ready. Good night, good night!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>We thought it best that he (<font color='blue'><b>Provis</b></font>) should stay in his (<font color='blue'><b>Provis</b></font>) own rooms; and we left him (<font color='blue'><b>Provis</b></font>)
on the landing outside his (<font color='blue'><b>Provis</b></font>) door, holding a light over the stair-rail to
light us downstairs. Looking back at him (<font color='blue'><b>Provis</b></font>), I thought of the first night
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Provis</b></font>) return, when our positions were reversed, and when I little
supposed my heart could ever be as heavy and anxious at parting from him (<font color='blue'><b>Provis</b></font>)
as it was now.

<p/>Old Barley was growling and swearing when we repassed his (<font color='blue'><b>Provis</b></font>) door, with no
appearance of having ceased or of meaning to cease. When we got to the
foot of the stairs, I asked Herbert whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) had preserved the name of
Provis. He (<font color='blue'><b>Provis</b></font>) replied, certainly not, and that the lodger was Mr. Campbell.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) also explained that the utmost known of Mr. Campbell there was,
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) -LRB-Herbert-RRB- had Mr. Campbell consigned to him (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>), and felt a strong
personal interest in his (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) being well cared for, and living a secluded
life. So, when we went into the parlor where Mrs. Whimple and Clara were
seated at work, I said nothing of my own interest in Mr. Campbell, but
kept it to myself.

<p/>When I had taken leave of the pretty, gentle, dark-eyed girl, and of the
motherly woman who had not outlived her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) honest sympathy with a little
affair of true love, I felt as if the Old Green Copper Rope-walk had
grown quite a different place. Old Barley might be as old as the hills,
and might swear like a whole field of troopers, but there were redeeming
youth and trust and hope enough in Chinks's Basin to fill it to
overflowing. And then I thought of Estella, and of our parting, and went
home very sadly.

<p/>All things were as quiet in the Temple as ever I had seen them. The
windows of the rooms on that side, lately occupied by Provis, were dark
and still, and there was no lounger in Garden Court. I walked past the
fountain twice or thrice before I descended the steps that were between
me and my rooms, but I was quite alone. Herbert, coming to my
bedside when he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) came in,--for I went straight to bed, dispirited and
fatigued,--made the same report. Opening one of the windows after that,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) looked out into the moonlight, and told me that the pavement was as
solemnly empty as the pavement of any cathedral at that same hour.

<p/>Next day I set myself to get the boat. It was soon done, and the boat
was brought round to the Temple stairs, and lay where I could reach
her (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) within a minute or two. Then, I began to go out as for training and
practice: sometimes alone, sometimes with Herbert. I was often out in
cold, rain, and sleet, but nobody took much note of me after I had been
out a few times. At first, I kept above Blackfriars Bridge; but as the
hours of the tide changed, I took towards London Bridge. It was Old
London Bridge in those days, and at certain states of the tide there
was a race and fall of water there which gave it a bad reputation. But I
knew well enough how to `shoot' the bridge after seeing it done, and so
began to row about among the shipping in the Pool, and down to Erith.
The first time I passed Mill Pond Bank, Herbert and I were pulling a
pair of oars; and, both in going and returning, we saw the blind towards
the east come down. Herbert was rarely there less frequently than three
times in a week, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) never brought me a single word of intelligence
that was at all alarming. Still, I knew that there was cause for alarm,
and I could not get rid of the notion of being watched. Once received,
it is a haunting idea; how many undesigning persons I suspected of
watching me, it would be hard to calculate.

<p/>In short, I was always full of fears for the rash man who was in hiding.
Herbert had sometimes said to me that he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) found it pleasant to stand at
one of our windows after dark, when the tide was running down, and to
think that it was flowing, with everything it bore, towards Clara. But
I thought with dread that it was flowing towards Magwitch, and that
any black mark on its surface might be his (<font color='blue'><b>Magwitch</b></font>) pursuers, going swiftly,
silently, and surely, to take him (<font color='blue'><b>Magwitch</b></font>).




<p/>Chapter XLVII

<p/>Some weeks passed without bringing any change. We waited for Wemmick,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) made no sign. If I had never known him (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) out of Little Britain, and
had never enjoyed the privilege of being on a familiar footing at the
Castle, I might have doubted him (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>); not so for a moment, knowing him (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) as I
did.

<p/>My worldly affairs began to wear a gloomy appearance, and I was pressed
for money by more than one creditor. Even I myself began to know the
want of money -LRB-I mean of ready money in my own pocket-RRB-, and to relieve
it by converting some easily spared articles of jewelery into cash. But
I had quite determined that it would be a heartless fraud to take more
money from my patron in the existing state of my uncertain thoughts and
plans. Therefore, I had sent him (<font color='blue'><b>patron</b></font>) the unopened pocket-book by Herbert, to
hold in his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) own keeping, and I felt a kind of satisfaction--whether it
was a false kind or a true, I hardly know--in not having profited by his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>)
generosity since his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) revelation of himself.

<p/>As the time wore on, an impression settled heavily upon me that Estella
was married. Fearful of having it confirmed, though it was all but a
conviction, I avoided the newspapers, and begged Herbert -LRB-to whom I had
confided the circumstances of our last interview-RRB- never to speak of her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>)
to me. Why I hoarded up this last wretched little rag of the robe of
hope that was rent and given to the winds, how do I know? Why did you
who read this, commit that not dissimilar inconsistency of your own last
year, last month, last week?

<p/>It was an unhappy life that I lived; and its one dominant anxiety,
towering over all its other anxieties, like a high mountain above a
range of mountains, never disappeared from my view. Still, no new cause
for fear arose. Let me start from my bed as I would, with the terror
fresh upon me that he (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) was discovered; let me sit listening, as I would
with dread, for Herbert's returning step at night, lest it should be
fleeter than ordinary, and winged with evil news,--for all that, and
much more to like purpose, the round of things went on. Condemned to
inaction and a state of constant restlessness and suspense, I rowed
about in my boat, and waited, waited, waited, as I best could.

<p/>There were states of the tide when, having been down the river, I could
not get back through the eddy-chafed arches and starlings of old London
Bridge; then, I left my boat at a wharf near the Custom House, to be
brought up afterwards to the Temple stairs. I was not averse to doing
this, as it served to make me and my boat a commoner incident among the
water-side people there. From this slight occasion sprang two meetings
that I have now to tell of.

<p/>One afternoon, late in the month of February, I came ashore at the wharf
at dusk. I had pulled down as far as Greenwich with the ebb tide, and
had turned with the tide. It had been a fine bright day, but had become
foggy as the sun dropped, and I had had to feel my way back among the
shipping, pretty carefully. Both in going and returning, I had seen the
signal in his (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) window, All well.

<p/>As it was a raw evening, and I was cold, I thought I would comfort
myself with dinner at once; and as I had hours of dejection and solitude
before me if I went home to the Temple, I thought I would afterwards go
to the play. The theatre where Mr. Wopsle had achieved his (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) questionable
triumph was in that water-side neighborhood -LRB-it is nowhere now-RRB-, and
to that theatre I resolved to go. I was aware that Mr. Wopsle had
not succeeded in reviving the Drama, but, on the contrary, had rather
partaken of its decline. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) had been ominously heard of, through the
play-bills, as a faithful Black, in connection with a little girl of
noble birth, and a monkey. And Herbert had seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) as a predatory
Tartar of comic propensities, with a face like a red brick, and an
outrageous hat all over bells.

<p/>I dined at what Herbert and I used to call a geographical chop-house,
where there were maps of the world in porter-pot rims on every half-yard
of the tablecloths, and charts of gravy on every one of the knives,--to
this day there is scarcely a single chop-house within the Lord Mayor's
dominions which is not geographical,--and wore out the time in dozing
over crumbs, staring at gas, and baking in a hot blast of dinners. By
and by, I roused myself, and went to the play.

<p/>There, I found a virtuous boatswain in His (<font color='blue'><b>Mayor</b></font>) Majesty's service,--a most
excellent man, though I could have wished his (<font color='blue'><b>Mayor</b></font>) trousers not quite so
tight in some places, and not quite so loose in others,--who knocked all
the little men's hats over their eyes, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Mayor</b></font>) was very generous and
brave, and who wouldn't hear of anybody's paying taxes, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Mayor</b></font>) was
very patriotic. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mayor</b></font>) had a bag of money in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mayor</b></font>) pocket, like a pudding in
the cloth, and on that property married a young person in bed-furniture,
with great rejoicings; the whole population of Portsmouth -LRB-nine in
number at the last census-RRB- turning out on the beach to rub their own
hands and shake everybody else's, and sing <div class="bookquote">``Fill, fill!''  (<font color='red'><b>everybody</b></font>)</div>A certain
dark-complexioned Swab, however, who wouldn't fill, or do anything else
that was proposed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Mayor</b></font>), and whose heart was openly stated -LRB-by the
boatswain-RRB- to be as black as his (<font color='blue'><b>Mayor</b></font>) figure-head, proposed to two other
Swabs to get all mankind into difficulties; which was so effectually
done -LRB-the Swab family having considerable political influence-RRB- that it
took half the evening to set things right, and then it was only brought
about through an honest little grocer with a white hat, black gaiters,
and red nose, getting into a clock, with a gridiron, and listening, and
coming out, and knocking everybody down from behind with the gridiron
whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Mayor</b></font>) couldn't confute with what he (<font color='blue'><b>Mayor</b></font>) had overheard. This led to Mr.
Wopsle's -LRB-who had never been heard of before-RRB- coming in with a star
and garter on, as a plenipotentiary of great power direct from the
Admiralty, to say that the Swabs were all to go to prison on the spot,
and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) had brought the boatswain down the Union Jack, as a slight
acknowledgment of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) public services. The boatswain, unmanned for the
first time, respectfully dried his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) eyes on the Jack, and then cheering
up, and addressing Mr. Wopsle as Your Honor, solicited permission to
take him (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) by the fin. Mr. Wopsle, conceding his (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) fin with a gracious
dignity, was immediately shoved into a dusty corner, while everybody
danced a hornpipe; and from that corner, surveying the public with a
discontented eye, became aware of me.

<p/>The second piece was the last new grand comic Christmas pantomime, in
the first scene of which, it pained me to suspect that I detected
Mr. Wopsle with red worsted legs under a highly magnified phosphoric
countenance and a shock of red curtain-fringe for his (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) hair, engaged
in the manufacture of thunderbolts in a mine, and displaying great
cowardice when his (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) gigantic master came home -LRB-very hoarse-RRB- to dinner.
But he (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) presently presented himself under worthier circumstances; for,
the Genius of Youthful Love being in want of assistance,--on account of
the parental brutality of an ignorant farmer who opposed the choice
of his (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) daughter's heart, by purposely falling upon the object, in a
flour-sack, out of the first-floor window,--summoned a sententious
Enchanter; and he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>), coming up from the antipodes rather unsteadily, after
an apparently violent journey, proved to be Mr. Wopsle in a high-crowned
hat, with a necromantic work in one volume under his (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) arm. The business
of this enchanter on earth being principally to be talked at, sung at,
butted at, danced at, and flashed at with fires of various colors,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) had a good deal of time on his (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) hands. And I observed, with great
surprise, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) devoted it to staring in my direction as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) were
lost in amazement.

<p/>There was something so remarkable in the increasing glare of Mr.
Wopsle's eye, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) seemed to be turning so many things over in his (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>)
mind and to grow so confused, that I could not make it out. I sat
thinking of it long after he (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) had ascended to the clouds in a large
watch-case, and still I could not make it out. I was still thinking
of it when I came out of the theatre an hour afterwards, and found him (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>)
waiting for me near the door.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How do you do?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, shaking hands with him (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) as we turned down the
street together. <div class="bookquote">``I saw that you saw me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Saw you, Mr. Pip!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) returned. <div class="bookquote">``Yes, of course I saw you. But who else
was there?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who else?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is the strangest thing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wopsle/Wopsle</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Wopsle, drifting into his (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) lost
look again; <div class="bookquote">``and yet I could swear to him (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wopsle/Wopsle</b></font>)</div><p/>Becoming alarmed, I entreated Mr. Wopsle to explain his (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) meaning.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Whether I should have noticed him (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) at first but for your being there,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wopsle/Wopsle</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Wopsle, going on in the same lost way, <div class="bookquote">``I can't be positive;
yet I think I should.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wopsle/Wopsle</b></font>)</div><p/>Involuntarily I looked round me, as I was accustomed to look round me
when I went home; for these mysterious words gave me a chill.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! He (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) can't be in sight,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wopsle/Wopsle</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Wopsle. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) went out before I went
off. I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) go.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Having the reason that I had for being suspicious, I even suspected
this poor actor. I mistrusted a design to entrap me into some admission.
Therefore I glanced at him (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) as we walked on together, but said nothing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I had a ridiculous fancy that he (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) must be with you, Mr. Pip, till I saw
that you were quite unconscious of him (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>), sitting behind you there like a
ghost.''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>My former chill crept over me again, but I was resolved not to speak
yet, for it was quite consistent with his (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) words that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) might be set on
to induce me to connect these references with Provis. Of course, I was
perfectly sure and safe that Provis had not been there.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I dare say you wonder at me, Mr. Pip; indeed, I see you do. But it is
so very strange! You'll hardly believe what I am going to tell you. I
could hardly believe it myself, if you told me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed?''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, indeed. Mr. Pip, you remember in old times a certain Christmas Day,
when you were quite a child, and I dined at Gargery's, and some soldiers
came to the door to get a pair of handcuffs mended?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I remember it very well.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you remember that there was a chase after two convicts, and that we
joined in it, and that Gargery took you on his (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) back, and that I took the
lead, and you kept up with me as well as you could?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I remember it all very well.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Better than he (<font color='blue'><b>Provis</b></font>) thought,--except the last
clause.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And you remember that we came up with the two in a ditch, and that
there was a scuffle between them, and that one of them had been severely
handled and much mauled about the face by the other?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I see it all before me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And that the soldiers lighted torches, and put the two in the centre,
and that we went on to see the last of them, over the black marshes,
with the torchlight shining on their faces,--I am particular about
that,--with the torchlight shining on their faces, when there was an
outer ring of dark night all about us?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I. <div class="bookquote">``I remember all that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then, Mr. Pip, one of those two prisoners sat behind you tonight. I saw
him (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) over your shoulder.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Steady!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I thought. I asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Provis</b></font>) then, <div class="bookquote">``Which of the two do you suppose
you saw?''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The one who had been mauled,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Provis</b></font>) answered readily, <div class="bookquote">``and I'll swear I
saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>)! The more I think of him (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>), the more certain I am of him (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``This is very curious!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, with the best assumption I could put on
of its being nothing more to me. <div class="bookquote">``Very curious indeed!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I cannot exaggerate the enhanced disquiet into which this conversation
threw me, or the special and peculiar terror I felt at Compeyson's
having been behind me <div class="bookquote">``like a ghost.''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>For if he (<font color='blue'><b>Provis</b></font>) had ever been out of my
thoughts for a few moments together since the hiding had begun, it was
in those very moments when he (<font color='blue'><b>Provis</b></font>) was closest to me; and to think that I
should be so unconscious and off my guard after all my care was as if
I had shut an avenue of a hundred doors to keep him (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) out, and then had
found him (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) at my elbow. I could not doubt, either, that he (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) was there,
because I was there, and that, however slight an appearance of danger
there might be about us, danger was always near and active.

<p/>I put such questions to Mr. Wopsle as, When did the man come in? He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
could not tell me that; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) saw me, and over my shoulder he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) saw the man.
It was not until he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had seen him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) for some time that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) began to identify
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>); but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had from the first vaguely associated him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) with me, and
known him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) as somehow belonging to me in the old village time. How was
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) dressed? Prosperously, but not noticeably otherwise; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thought, in
black. Was his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face at all disfigured? No, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) believed not. I believed
not too, for, although in my brooding state I had taken no especial
notice of the people behind me, I thought it likely that a face at all
disfigured would have attracted my attention.

<p/>When Mr. Wopsle had imparted to me all that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) could recall or I
extract, and when I had treated him (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) to a little appropriate refreshment,
after the fatigues of the evening, we parted. It was between twelve and
one o’clock when I reached the Temple, and the gates were shut. No one
was near me when I went in and went home.

<p/>Herbert had come in, and we held a very serious council by the fire. But
there was nothing to be done, saving to communicate to Wemmick what I
had that night found out, and to remind him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) that we waited for his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) hint.
As I thought that I might compromise him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) if I went too often to the
Castle, I made this communication by letter. I wrote it before I went to
bed, and went out and posted it; and again no one was near me. Herbert
and I agreed that we could do nothing else but be very cautious. And
we were very cautious indeed,--more cautious than before, if that were
possible,--and I for my part never went near Chinks's Basin, except
when I rowed by, and then I only looked at Mill Pond Bank as I looked at
anything else.




<p/>Chapter XLVIII

<p/>The second of the two meetings referred to in the last chapter occurred
about a week after the first. I had again left my boat at the wharf
below Bridge; the time was an hour earlier in the afternoon; and,
undecided where to dine, I had strolled up into Cheapside, and was
strolling along it, surely the most unsettled person in all the busy
concourse, when a large hand was laid upon my shoulder by some one
overtaking me. It was Mr. Jaggers's hand, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) passed it through my
arm.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``As we are going in the same direction, Pip, we may walk together. Where
are you bound for?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``For the Temple, I think,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't you know?''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Jaggers.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I returned, glad for once to get the better of him (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) in
cross-examination, <div class="bookquote">``I do not know, for I have not made up my mind.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are going to dine?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jaggers/Jaggers/MR. JAGGERS</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Jaggers. <div class="bookquote">``You don't mind admitting
that, I suppose?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I returned, <div class="bookquote">``I don't mind admitting that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And are not engaged?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't mind admitting also that I am not engaged.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jaggers/Jaggers/MR. JAGGERS</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Jaggers, <div class="bookquote">``come and dine with me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jaggers/Jaggers/MR. JAGGERS</b></font>)</div><p/>I was going to excuse myself, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``Wemmick's coming.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>So
I changed my excuse into an acceptance,--the few words I had uttered,
serving for the beginning of either,--and we went along Cheapside
and slanted off to Little Britain, while the lights were springing up
brilliantly in the shop windows, and the street lamp-lighters, scarcely
finding ground enough to plant their ladders on in the midst of the
afternoon's bustle, were skipping up and down and running in and out,
opening more red eyes in the gathering fog than my rushlight tower at
the Hummums had opened white eyes in the ghostly wall.

<p/>At the office in Little Britain there was the usual letter-writing,
hand-washing, candle-snuffing, and safe-locking, that closed the
business of the day. As I stood idle by Mr. Jaggers's fire, its rising
and falling flame made the two casts on the shelf look as if they were
playing a diabolical game at bo-peep with me; while the pair of coarse,
fat office candles that dimly lighted Mr. Jaggers as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) wrote in a
corner were decorated with dirty winding-sheets, as if in remembrance of
a host of hanged clients.

<p/>We went to Gerrard Street, all three together, in a hackney-coach: And,
as soon as we got there, dinner was served. Although I should not have
thought of making, in that place, the most distant reference by so much
as a look to Wemmick's Walworth sentiments, yet I should have had no
objection to catching his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) eye now and then in a friendly way. But it
was not to be done. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) eyes on Mr. Jaggers whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) raised
them from the table, and was as dry and distant to me as if there were
twin Wemmicks, and this was the wrong one.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Did you send that note of Miss Havisham's to Mr. Pip, Wemmick?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jaggers/Jaggers/MR. JAGGERS</b></font>)</div>Mr.
Jaggers asked, soon after we began dinner.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>returned Wemmick; <div class="bookquote">``it was going by post, when you brought Mr.
Pip into the office. Here it is.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) handed it to his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) principal instead
of to me.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's a note of two lines, Pip,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jaggers/Jaggers/MR. JAGGERS</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Jaggers, handing it on, <div class="bookquote">``sent
up to me by Miss Havisham on account of her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) not being sure of your
address. She (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) tells me that she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) wants to see you on a little matter of
business you mentioned to her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>). You'll go down?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jaggers/Jaggers/MR. JAGGERS</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, casting my eyes over the note, which was exactly in those
terms.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``When do you think of going down?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have an impending engagement,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, glancing at Wemmick, who was
putting fish into the post-office, <div class="bookquote">``that renders me rather uncertain of
my time. At once, I think.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If Mr. Pip has the intention of going at once,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div>said Wemmick to Mr.
Jaggers, <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) needn't write an answer, you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jaggers/Jaggers/MR. JAGGERS</b></font>)</div><p/>Receiving this as an intimation that it was best not to delay, I settled
that I would go to-morrow, and said so. Wemmick drank a glass of wine,
and looked with a grimly satisfied air at Mr. Jaggers, but not at me.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So, Pip! Our friend the Spider,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jaggers/Jaggers/MR. JAGGERS</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Jaggers, <div class="bookquote">``has played his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)
cards. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) has won the pool.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jaggers/Jaggers/MR. JAGGERS</b></font>)</div><p/>It was as much as I could do to assent.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hah! He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) is a promising fellow--in his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) way--but he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) may not have it all
his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) own way. The stronger will win in the end, but the stronger has to
be found out first. If he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) should turn to, and beat her (<font color='blue'><b>Spider</b></font>)--''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Surely,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I interrupted, with a burning face and heart, <div class="bookquote">``you do not
seriously think that he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) is scoundrel enough for that, Mr. Jaggers?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I didn't say so, Pip. I am putting a case. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) should turn to and
beat her (<font color='blue'><b>Spider</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) may possibly get the strength on his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) side; if it should be
a question of intellect, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) certainly will not. It would be chance
work to give an opinion how a fellow of that sort will turn out in such
circumstances, because it's a toss-up between two results.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``May I ask what they are?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A fellow like our friend the Spider,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jaggers/Jaggers/MR. JAGGERS</b></font>)</div>answered Mr. Jaggers, <div class="bookquote">``either
beats or cringes. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) may cringe and growl, or cringe and not growl; but
he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) either beats or cringes. Ask Wemmick his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) opinion.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jaggers/Jaggers/MR. JAGGERS</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Either beats or cringes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div>said Wemmick, not at all addressing himself
to me.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So here's to Mrs. Bentley Drummle,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jaggers/Jaggers/MR. JAGGERS</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Jaggers, taking a decanter
of choicer wine from his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) dumb-waiter, and filling for each of us and
for himself, <div class="bookquote">``and may the question of supremacy be settled to the lady's
satisfaction! To the satisfaction of the lady and the gentleman,
it never will be. Now, Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly, how slow you are
to-day!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jaggers/Jaggers/MR. JAGGERS</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) was at his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) elbow when he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) addressed her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), putting a dish upon the
table. As she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) withdrew her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) hands from it, she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) fell back a step or two,
nervously muttering some excuse. And a certain action of her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) fingers, as
she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) spoke, arrested my attention.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What's the matter?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jaggers/Jaggers/MR. JAGGERS</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Jaggers.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing. Only the subject we were speaking of,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, <div class="bookquote">``was rather
painful to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>The action of her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) fingers was like the action of knitting. She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) stood
looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) master, not understanding whether she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) was free to go, or
whether he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) had more to say to her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) and would call her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) back if she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) did go.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) look was very intent. Surely, I had seen exactly such eyes and such
hands on a memorable occasion very lately!

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) dismissed her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) glided out of the room. But she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) remained
before me as plainly as if she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) were still there. I looked at those
hands, I looked at those eyes, I looked at that flowing hair; and I
compared them with other hands, other eyes, other hair, that I knew of,
and with what those might be after twenty years of a brutal husband
and a stormy life. I looked again at those hands and eyes of the
housekeeper, and thought of the inexplicable feeling that had come over
me when I last walked--not alone--in the ruined garden, and through the
deserted brewery. I thought how the same feeling had come back when I
saw a face looking at me, and a hand waving to me from a stage-coach
window; and how it had come back again and had flashed about me like
lightning, when I had passed in a carriage--not alone--through a sudden
glare of light in a dark street. I thought how one link of association
had helped that identification in the theatre, and how such a link,
wanting before, had been riveted for me now, when I had passed by a
chance swift from Estella's name to the fingers with their knitting
action, and the attentive eyes. And I felt absolutely certain that this
woman was Estella's mother.

<p/>Mr. Jaggers had seen me with Estella, and was not likely to have missed
the sentiments I had been at no pains to conceal. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) nodded when I said
the subject was painful to me, clapped me on the back, put round the
wine again, and went on with his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) dinner.

<p/>Only twice more did the housekeeper reappear, and then her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) stay in the
room was very short, and Mr. Jaggers was sharp with her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>). But her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) hands
were Estella's hands, and her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) eyes were Estella's eyes, and if she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) had
reappeared a hundred times I could have been neither more sure nor less
sure that my conviction was the truth.

<p/>It was a dull evening, for Wemmick drew his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) wine, when it came round,
quite as a matter of business,--just as he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) might have drawn his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) salary
when that came round,--and with his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) eyes on his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) chief, sat in a state of
perpetual readiness for cross-examination. As to the quantity of wine,
his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) post-office was as indifferent and ready as any other post-office
for its quantity of letters. From my point of view, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) was the wrong
twin all the time, and only externally like the Wemmick of Walworth.

<p/>We took our leave early, and left together. Even when we were groping
among Mr. Jaggers's stock of boots for our hats, I felt that the right
twin was on his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) way back; and we had not gone half a dozen yards down
Gerrard Street in the Walworth direction, before I found that I was
walking arm in arm with the right twin, and that the wrong twin had
evaporated into the evening air.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well!''  (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div>said Wemmick, <div class="bookquote">``that's over! He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)'s a wonderful man, without his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
living likeness; but I feel that I have to screw myself up when I dine
with him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>),--and I dine more comfortably unscrewed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div><p/>I felt that this was a good statement of the case, and told him (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) so.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Wouldn't say it to anybody but yourself,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) answered. <div class="bookquote">``I know that
what is said between you and me goes no further.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) had ever seen Miss Havisham's adopted daughter, Mrs.
Bentley Drummle. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) said no. To avoid being too abrupt, I then spoke
of the Aged and of Miss Skiffins. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) looked rather sly when I mentioned
Miss Skiffins, and stopped in the street to blow his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) nose, with a roll
of the head, and a flourish not quite free from latent boastfulness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Wemmick,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, <div class="bookquote">``do you remember telling me, before I first went to
Mr. Jaggers's private house, to notice that housekeeper?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did I?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) replied. <div class="bookquote">``Ah, I dare say I did. Deuce take me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) added,
suddenly, <div class="bookquote">``I know I did. I find I am not quite unscrewed yet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A wild beast tamed, you called her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And what do you call her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The same. How did Mr. Jaggers tame her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>), Wemmick?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) secret. She (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) has been with him (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) many a long year.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish you would tell me her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) story. I feel a particular interest in
being acquainted with it. You know that what is said between you and me
goes no further.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well!''  (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div>Wemmick replied, <div class="bookquote">``I don't know her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) story,--that is, I don't know
all of it. But what I do know I'll tell you. We are in our private and
personal capacities, of course.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A score or so of years ago, that woman was tried at the Old Bailey for
murder, and was acquitted. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was a very handsome young woman, and I
believe had some gypsy blood in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). Anyhow, it was hot enough when it
was up, as you may suppose.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was acquitted.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Jaggers was for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div>pursued Wemmick, with a look full of meaning,
<div class="bookquote">``and worked the case in a way quite astonishing. It was a desperate
case, and it was comparatively early days with him (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) then, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) worked
it to general admiration; in fact, it may almost be said to have made
him (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) worked it himself at the police-office, day after day for many
days, contending against even a committal; and at the trial where he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>)
couldn't work it himself, sat under counsel, and--every one knew--put
in all the salt and pepper. The murdered person was a woman,--a woman a
good ten years older, very much larger, and very much stronger. It was
a case of jealousy. They both led tramping lives, and this woman in
Gerrard Street here had been married very young, over the broomstick -LRB-as
we say-RRB-, to a tramping man, and was a perfect fury in point of jealousy.
The murdered woman,--more a match for the man, certainly, in point of
years--was found dead in a barn near Hounslow Heath. There had been a
violent struggle, perhaps a fight. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was bruised and scratched and
torn, and had been held by the throat, at last, and choked. Now, there
was no reasonable evidence to implicate any person but this woman, and
on the improbabilities of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) having been able to do it Mr. Jaggers
principally rested his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) case. You may be sure,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div>said Wemmick, touching me
on the sleeve, <div class="bookquote">``that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) never dwelt upon the strength of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hands then,
though he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) sometimes does now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>I had told Wemmick of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) showing us her (<font color='blue'><b>Drummle</b></font>) wrists, that day of the dinner
party.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, sir!''  (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div>Wemmick went on; ``it happened--happened, don't you
see?--that this woman was so very artfully dressed from the time of
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) apprehension, that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) looked much slighter than she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) really was; in
particular, her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) sleeves are always remembered to have been so skilfully
contrived that her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) arms had quite a delicate look. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had only a bruise
or two about her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>),--nothing for a tramp,--but the backs of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hands
were lacerated, and the question was, Was it with finger-nails? Now, Mr.
Jaggers showed that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had struggled through a great lot of brambles
which were not as high as her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) face; but which she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) could not have got
through and kept her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hands out of; and bits of those brambles were
actually found in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) skin and put in evidence, as well as the fact that
the brambles in question were found on examination to have been broken
through, and to have little shreds of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) dress and little spots of
blood upon them here and there. But the boldest point he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) made was this:
it was attempted to be set up, in proof of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) jealousy, that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was
under strong suspicion of having, at about the time of the murder,
frantically destroyed her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) child by this man--some three years old--to
revenge herself upon him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). Mr. Jaggers worked that in this way: ``We say
these are not marks of finger-nails, but marks of brambles, and we show
you the brambles. You say they are marks of finger-nails, and you set
up the hypothesis that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) destroyed her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) child. You must accept all
consequences of that hypothesis. For anything we know, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) may have
destroyed her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) child, and the child in clinging to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) may have scratched
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hands. What then? You are not trying her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) for the murder of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
child; why don't you? As to this case, if you will have scratches,
we say that, for anything we know, you may have accounted for them,
assuming for the sake of argument that you have not invented them?'' ``To
sum up, sir,'' said Wemmick, <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Jaggers was altogether too many for the
jury, and they gave in.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Has she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) been in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) service ever since?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; but not only that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div>said Wemmick, <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) went into his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) service
immediately after her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) acquittal, tamed as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is now. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) has since been
taught one thing and another in the way of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) duties, but she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was tamed
from the beginning.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you remember the sex of the child?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Said to have been a girl.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You have nothing more to say to me to-night?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing. I got your letter and destroyed it. Nothing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>We exchanged a cordial good-night, and I went home, with new matter for
my thoughts, though with no relief from the old.




<p/>Chapter XLIX

<p/>Putting Miss Havisham's note in my pocket, that it might serve as
my credentials for so soon reappearing at Satis House, in case her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>)
waywardness should lead her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) to express any surprise at seeing me, I went
down again by the coach next day. But I alighted at the Halfway House,
and breakfasted there, and walked the rest of the distance; for I sought
to get into the town quietly by the unfrequented ways, and to leave it
in the same manner.

<p/>The best light of the day was gone when I passed along the quiet echoing
courts behind the High Street. The nooks of ruin where the old monks had
once had their refectories and gardens, and where the strong walls were
now pressed into the service of humble sheds and stables, were almost
as silent as the old monks in their graves. The cathedral chimes had at
once a sadder and a more remote sound to me, as I hurried on avoiding
observation, than they had ever had before; so, the swell of the old
organ was borne to my ears like funeral music; and the rooks, as they
hovered about the gray tower and swung in the bare high trees of the
priory garden, seemed to call to me that the place was changed, and that
Estella was gone out of it for ever.

<p/>An elderly woman, whom I had seen before as one of the servants who
lived in the supplementary house across the back courtyard, opened the
gate. The lighted candle stood in the dark passage within, as of old,
and I took it up and ascended the staircase alone. Miss Havisham was not
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) own room, but was in the larger room across the landing. Looking
in at the door, after knocking in vain, I saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) sitting on the hearth
in a ragged chair, close before, and lost in the contemplation of, the
ashy fire.

<p/>Doing as I had often done, I went in, and stood touching the old
chimney-piece, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) could see me when she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) raised her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) eyes. There
was an air of utter loneliness upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>), that would have moved me to
pity though she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) had wilfully done me a deeper injury than I could charge
her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) with. As I stood compassionating her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>), and thinking how, in the
progress of time, I too had come to be a part of the wrecked fortunes of
that house, her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) eyes rested on me. She (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) stared, and said in a low voice,
<div class="bookquote">``Is it real?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is I, Pip. Mr. Jaggers gave me your note yesterday, and I have lost
no time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you. Thank you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>As I brought another of the ragged chairs to the hearth and sat down, I
remarked a new expression on her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) face, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) were afraid of me.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I want,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``to pursue that subject you mentioned to me when you
were last here, and to show you that I am not all stone. But perhaps you
can never believe, now, that there is anything human in my heart?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>When I said some reassuring words, she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) stretched out her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) tremulous right
hand, as though she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) was going to touch me; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) recalled it again
before I understood the action, or knew how to receive it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You said, speaking for your friend, that you could tell me how to do
something useful and good. Something that you would like done, is it
not?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Something that I would like done very much.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What is it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I began explaining to her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) that secret history of the partnership. I had
not got far into it, when I judged from her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) looks that she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) was thinking
in a discursive way of me, rather than of what I said. It seemed to be
so; for, when I stopped speaking, many moments passed before she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) showed
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) was conscious of the fact.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you break off,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) asked then, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) former air of being afraid
of me, <div class="bookquote">``because you hate me too much to bear to speak to me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I answered, <div class="bookquote">``how can you think so, Miss Havisham! I stopped
because I thought you were not following what I said.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps I was not,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) answered, putting a hand to her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``Begin
again, and let me look at something else. Stay! Now tell me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) set her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) hand upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) stick in the resolute way that sometimes was
habitual to her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>), and looked at the fire with a strong expression of
forcing herself to attend. I went on with my explanation, and told her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>)
how I had hoped to complete the transaction out of my means, but how
in this I was disappointed. That part of the subject -LRB-I reminded her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>)-RRB-
involved matters which could form no part of my explanation, for they
were the weighty secrets of another.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>), assenting with her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) head, but not looking at me. <div class="bookquote">``And how
much money is wanting to complete the purchase?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I was rather afraid of stating it, for it sounded a large sum. <div class="bookquote">``Nine
hundred pounds.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If I give you the money for this purpose, will you keep my secret as
you have kept your own?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Quite as faithfully.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And your mind will be more at rest?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Much more at rest.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you very unhappy now?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) asked this question, still without looking at me, but in an unwonted
tone of sympathy. I could not reply at the moment, for my voice failed
me. She (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) put her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) left arm across the head of her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) stick, and softly laid
her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) forehead on it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am far from happy, Miss Havisham; but I have other causes of disquiet
than any you know of. They are the secrets I have mentioned.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>After a little while, she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) raised her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) head, and looked at the fire again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is noble in you to tell me that you have other causes of
unhappiness. Is it true?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Too true.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Can I only serve you, Pip, by serving your friend? Regarding that as
done, is there nothing I can do for you yourself?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing. I thank you for the question. I thank you even more for the
tone of the question. But there is nothing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) presently rose from her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) seat, and looked about the blighted room
for the means of writing. There were none there, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) took from her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>)
pocket a yellow set of ivory tablets, mounted in tarnished gold, and
wrote upon them with a pencil in a case of tarnished gold that hung from
her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) neck.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are still on friendly terms with Mr. Jaggers?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Quite. I dined with him (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) yesterday.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``This is an authority to him (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) to pay you that money, to lay out at your
irresponsible discretion for your friend. I keep no money here; but if
you would rather Mr. Jaggers knew nothing of the matter, I will send it
to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you, Miss Havisham; I have not the least objection to receiving
it from him (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) read me what she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) had written; and it was direct and clear, and
evidently intended to absolve me from any suspicion of profiting by the
receipt of the money. I took the tablets from her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) hand, and it trembled
again, and it trembled more as she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) took off the chain to which the
pencil was attached, and put it in mine. All this she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) did without
looking at me.

<p/>``My name is on the first leaf. If you can ever write under my name, ``I
forgive her (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>),<div class="bookquote">'' though ever so long after my broken heart is dust pray do
it!''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``O Miss Havisham,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, <div class="bookquote">``I can do it now. There have been sore
mistakes; and my life has been a blind and thankless one; and I want
forgiveness and direction far too much, to be bitter with you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) face to me for the first time since she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) had averted it,
and, to my amazement, I may even add to my terror, dropped on her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) knees
at my feet; with her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) folded hands raised to me in the manner in which,
when her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) poor heart was young and fresh and whole, they must often have
been raised to heaven from her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) mother's side.

<p/>To see her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) with her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) white hair and her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) worn face kneeling at my feet
gave me a shock through all my frame. I entreated her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) to rise, and got
my arms about her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) to help her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) up; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) only pressed that hand of mine
which was nearest to her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) grasp, and hung her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) head over it and wept. I
had never seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) shed a tear before, and, in the hope that the
relief might do her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) good, I bent over her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) without speaking. She (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) was not
kneeling now, but was down upon the ground.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``O!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) cried, despairingly. <div class="bookquote">``What have I done! What have I done!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you mean, Miss Havisham, what have you done to injure me, let me
answer. Very little. I should have loved her (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) under any circumstances. Is
she (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) married?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>It was a needless question, for a new desolation in the desolate house
had told me so.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What have I done! What have I done!''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) wrung her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) hands, and crushed
her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) white hair, and returned to this cry over and over again. <div class="bookquote">``What have
I done!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I knew not how to answer, or how to comfort her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>). That she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) had done a
grievous thing in taking an impressionable child to mould into the form
that her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) wild resentment, spurned affection, and wounded pride found
vengeance in, I knew full well. But that, in shutting out the light
of day, she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) had shut out infinitely more; that, in seclusion, she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) had
secluded herself from a thousand natural and healing influences; that,
her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) mind, brooding solitary, had grown diseased, as all minds do and
must and will that reverse the appointed order of their Maker, I knew
equally well. And could I look upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) without compassion, seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>)
punishment in the ruin she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) was, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) profound unfitness for this earth
on which she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) was placed, in the vanity of sorrow which had become a
master mania, like the vanity of penitence, the vanity of remorse, the
vanity of unworthiness, and other monstrous vanities that have been
curses in this world?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Until you spoke to her (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) the other day, and until I saw in you a
looking-glass that showed me what I once felt myself, I did not know
what I had done. What have I done! What have I done!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And so again,
twenty, fifty times over, What had she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) done!

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Havisham,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said, when her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) cry had died away, <div class="bookquote">``you may dismiss me

you can ever undo any scrap of what you have done amiss in keeping a
part of her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) right nature away from her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>), it will be better to do that
than to bemoan the past through a hundred years.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, yes, I know it. But, Pip--my dear!''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>There was an earnest womanly
compassion for me in her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) new affection. <div class="bookquote">``My dear! Believe this: when she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>)
first came to me, I meant to save her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) from misery like my own. At first,
I meant no more.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, well!''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I. <div class="bookquote">``I hope so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But as she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) grew, and promised to be very beautiful, I gradually did
worse, and with my praises, and with my jewels, and with my teachings,
and with this figure of myself always before her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>), a warning to back and
point my lessons, I stole her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) heart away, and put ice in its place.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Better,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I could not help saying, <div class="bookquote">``to have left her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) a natural heart,

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>With that, Miss Havisham looked distractedly at me for a while, and then
burst out again, What had she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) done!

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you knew all my story,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) pleaded, <div class="bookquote">``you would have some compassion
for me and a better understanding of me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Havisham,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I answered, as delicately as I could, <div class="bookquote">``I believe I may
say that I do know your story, and have known it ever since I first left
this neighborhood. It has inspired me with great commiseration, and I

she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) is, but as she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) was when she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) first came here?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) was seated on the ground, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) arms on the ragged chair, and
her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) head leaning on them. She (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) looked full at me when I said this, and
replied, <div class="bookquote">``Go on.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Whose child was Estella?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) head.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't know?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) head again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But Mr. Jaggers brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) here, or sent her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) here?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Will you tell me how that came about?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) answered in a low whisper and with caution: <div class="bookquote">``I had been shut up in
these rooms a long time -LRB-I don't know how long; you know what time the
clocks keep here-RRB-, when I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) that I wanted a little girl to rear
and love, and save from my fate. I had first seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) when I sent
for him (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) to lay this place waste for me; having read of him (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) in the
newspapers, before I and the world parted. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) told me that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) would
look about him (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) for such an orphan child. One night he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) brought her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) here
asleep, and I called her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) Estella.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Might I ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) age then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Two or three. She (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) herself knows nothing, but that she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) was left an
orphan and I adopted her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>So convinced I was of that woman's being her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) mother, that I wanted
no evidence to establish the fact in my own mind. But, to any mind, I
thought, the connection here was clear and straight.

<p/>What more could I hope to do by prolonging the interview? I had
succeeded on behalf of Herbert, Miss Havisham had told me all she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) knew
of Estella, I had said and done what I could to ease her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) mind. No matter
with what other words we parted; we parted.

<p/>Twilight was closing in when I went downstairs into the natural air. I
called to the woman who had opened the gate when I entered, that I would
not trouble her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) just yet, but would walk round the place before leaving.
For I had a presentiment that I should never be there again, and I felt
that the dying light was suited to my last view of it.

<p/>By the wilderness of casks that I had walked on long ago, and on which
the rain of years had fallen since, rotting them in many places, and
leaving miniature swamps and pools of water upon those that stood on
end, I made my way to the ruined garden. I went all round it; round by
the corner where Herbert and I had fought our battle; round by the paths
where Estella and I had walked. So cold, so lonely, so dreary all!

<p/>Taking the brewery on my way back, I raised the rusty latch of a little
door at the garden end of it, and walked through. I was going out at the
opposite door,--not easy to open now, for the damp wood had started and
swelled, and the hinges were yielding, and the threshold was encumbered
with a growth of fungus,--when I turned my head to look back. A childish
association revived with wonderful force in the moment of the slight
action, and I fancied that I saw Miss Havisham hanging to the beam. So
strong was the impression, that I stood under the beam shuddering from
head to foot before I knew it was a fancy,--though to be sure I was
there in an instant.

<p/>The mournfulness of the place and time, and the great terror of
this illusion, though it was but momentary, caused me to feel an
indescribable awe as I came out between the open wooden gates where I
had once wrung my hair after Estella had wrung my heart. Passing on into
the front courtyard, I hesitated whether to call the woman to let me out
at the locked gate of which she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had the key, or first to go upstairs
and assure myself that Miss Havisham was as safe and well as I had left
her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>). I took the latter course and went up.

<p/>I looked into the room where I had left her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>), and I saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) seated in the
ragged chair upon the hearth close to the fire, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) back towards
me. In the moment when I was withdrawing my head to go quietly away,
I saw a great flaming light spring up. In the same moment I saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>)
running at me, shrieking, with a whirl of fire blazing all about her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>),
and soaring at least as many feet above her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) head as she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) was high.

<p/>I had a double-caped great-coat on, and over my arm another thick coat.
That I got them off, closed with her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>), threw her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) down, and got them over
her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>); that I dragged the great cloth from the table for the same purpose,
and with it dragged down the heap of rottenness in the midst, and
all the ugly things that sheltered there; that we were on the ground
struggling like desperate enemies, and that the closer I covered her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>),
the more wildly she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) shrieked and tried to free herself,--that this
occurred I knew through the result, but not through anything I felt, or
thought, or knew I did. I knew nothing until I knew that we were on the
floor by the great table, and that patches of tinder yet alight were
floating in the smoky air, which, a moment ago, had been her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) faded
bridal dress.

<p/>Then, I looked round and saw the disturbed beetles and spiders running
away over the floor, and the servants coming in with breathless cries
at the door. I still held her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) forcibly down with all my strength, like
a prisoner who might escape; and I doubt if I even knew who she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) was, or
why we had struggled, or that she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) had been in flames, or that the flames
were out, until I saw the patches of tinder that had been her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) garments
no longer alight but falling in a black shower around us.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) was insensible, and I was afraid to have her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) moved, or even
touched. Assistance was sent for, and I held her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) until it came, as if
I unreasonably fancied -LRB-I think I did-RRB- that, if I let her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) go, the fire
would break out again and consume her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>). When I got up, on the surgeon's
coming to her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) with other aid, I was astonished to see that both my hands
were burnt; for, I had no knowledge of it through the sense of feeling.

<p/>On examination it was pronounced that she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) had received serious hurts,
but that they of themselves were far from hopeless; the danger lay
mainly in the nervous shock. By the surgeon's directions, her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) bed was
carried into that room and laid upon the great table, which happened to
be well suited to the dressing of her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) injuries. When I saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) again, an
hour afterwards, she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) lay, indeed, where I had seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) strike her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) stick,
and had heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) say that she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) would lie one day.

<p/>Though every vestige of her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) dress was burnt, as they told me, she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>)
still had something of her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) old ghastly bridal appearance; for, they had
covered her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) to the throat with white cotton-wool, and as she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) lay with
a white sheet loosely overlying that, the phantom air of something that
had been and was changed was still upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>).

<p/>I found, on questioning the servants, that Estella was in Paris, and I
got a promise from the surgeon that he (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) would write to her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) by the
next post. Miss Havisham's family I took upon myself; intending to
communicate with Mr. Matthew Pocket only, and leave him (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) to do as he (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>)
liked about informing the rest. This I did next day, through Herbert, as
soon as I returned to town.

<p/>There was a stage, that evening, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) spoke collectedly of what had
happened, though with a certain terrible vivacity. Towards midnight she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>)
began to wander in her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) speech; and after that it gradually set in that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) said innumerable times in a low solemn voice, <div class="bookquote">``What have I done!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And then, <div class="bookquote">``When she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) first came, I meant to save her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) from misery like
mine.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>And then, ``Take the pencil and write under my name, `I forgive
her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>)!''' She (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) never changed the order of these three sentences, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>)
sometimes left out a word in one or other of them; never putting in
another word, but always leaving a blank and going on to the next word.

<p/>As I could do no service there, and as I had, nearer home, that pressing
reason for anxiety and fear which even her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) wanderings could not drive
out of my mind, I decided, in the course of the night that I would
return by the early morning coach, walking on a mile or so, and being
taken up clear of the town. At about six o’clock of the morning,
therefore, I leaned over her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) and touched her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) lips with mine, just as
they said, not stopping for being touched, ``Take the pencil and write
under my name, `I forgive her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>).'''




<p/>Chapter L

<p/>My hands had been dressed twice or thrice in the night, and again in
the morning. My left arm was a good deal burned to the elbow, and, less
severely, as high as the shoulder; it was very painful, but the flames
had set in that direction, and I felt thankful it was no worse. My right
hand was not so badly burnt but that I could move the fingers. It was
bandaged, of course, but much less inconveniently than my left hand and
arm; those I carried in a sling; and I could only wear my coat like a
cloak, loose over my shoulders and fastened at the neck. My hair had
been caught by the fire, but not my head or face.

<p/>When Herbert had been down to Hammersmith and seen his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) father, he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) came
back to me at our chambers, and devoted the day to attending on me. He (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>)
was the kindest of nurses, and at stated times took off the bandages,
and steeped them in the cooling liquid that was kept ready, and put them
on again, with a patient tenderness that I was deeply grateful for.

<p/>At first, as I lay quiet on the sofa, I found it painfully difficult, I
might say impossible, to get rid of the impression of the glare of the
flames, their hurry and noise, and the fierce burning smell. If I
dozed for a minute, I was awakened by Miss Havisham's cries, and by her (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>)
running at me with all that height of fire above her (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) head. This pain
of the mind was much harder to strive against than any bodily pain I
suffered; and Herbert, seeing that, did his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) utmost to hold my attention
engaged.

<p/>Neither of us spoke of the boat, but we both thought of it. That
was made apparent by our avoidance of the subject, and by our
agreeing--without agreement--to make my recovery of the use of my hands
a question of so many hours, not of so many weeks.

<p/>My first question when I saw Herbert had been of course, whether all
was well down the river? As he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) replied in the affirmative, with perfect
confidence and cheerfulness, we did not resume the subject until the day
was wearing away. But then, as Herbert changed the bandages, more by
the light of the fire than by the outer light, he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) went back to it
spontaneously.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I sat with Provis last night, Handel, two good hours.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Where was Clara?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear little thing!''  (<font color='red'><b>Herbert/Herbert Pocket</b></font>)</div>said Herbert. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) was up and down with
Gruffandgrim all the evening. He (<font color='blue'><b>Handel</b></font>) was perpetually pegging at the floor
the moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) left his (<font color='blue'><b>Handel</b></font>) sight. I doubt if he (<font color='blue'><b>Handel</b></font>) can hold out long, though.
What with rum and pepper,--and pepper and rum,--I should think his (<font color='blue'><b>Handel</b></font>)
pegging must be nearly over.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And then you will be married, Herbert?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How can I take care of the dear child otherwise?--Lay your arm out upon

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I said to you I thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Handel</b></font>) was softened when I last saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Handel</b></font>).''

woman that he (<font color='blue'><b>Handel</b></font>) had had great trouble with.--Did I hurt you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I had started, but not under his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) touch. His (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) words had given me a start.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I had forgotten that, Herbert, but I remember it now you speak of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell me by all means. Every word.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Herbert/Herbert Pocket</b></font>)</div><p/>Herbert bent forward to look at me more nearly, as if my reply had been
rather more hurried or more eager than he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) could quite account for. <div class="bookquote">``Your
head is cool?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) said, touching it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Quite,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I. <div class="bookquote">``Tell me what Provis said, my dear Herbert.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It seems,''  (<font color='red'><b>Herbert/Herbert Pocket</b></font>)</div>said Herbert, <div class="bookquote">``--there's a bandage off most charmingly, and

don't it? but it will be comfortable presently,--it seems that the
woman was a young woman, and a jealous woman, and a revengeful woman;
revengeful, Handel, to the last degree.''

her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), and the reputation of that defence first made his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) name known
to Provis. It was another and a stronger woman who was the victim,
and there had been a struggle--in a barn. Who began it, or how fair
it was, or how unfair, may be doubtful; but how it ended is
certainly not doubtful, for the victim was found throttled.''

child of whom Provis was exceedingly fond. On the evening of the very
night when the object of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) jealousy was strangled as I tell you, the
young woman presented herself before Provis for one moment, and swore
that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would destroy the child -LRB-which was in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) possession-RRB-, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Provis</b></font>)
should never see it again; then she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) vanished.--There's the worst arm

had shared some four or five years of the wretched life he (<font color='blue'><b>Provis</b></font>) described
to us at this fireside, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Provis</b></font>) seems to have felt pity for her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), and
forbearance towards her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). Therefore, fearing he (<font color='blue'><b>Provis</b></font>) should be called upon to
depose about this destroyed child, and so be the cause of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) death, he (<font color='blue'><b>Provis</b></font>)
hid himself -LRB-much as he (<font color='blue'><b>Provis</b></font>) grieved for the child-RRB-, kept himself dark, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Provis</b></font>)
says, out of the way and out of the trial, and was only vaguely talked
of as a certain man called Abel, out of whom the jealousy arose. After

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``N-no, my dear boy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Herbert/Herbert Pocket</b></font>)</div>said Herbert, after taking time to examine me. <div class="bookquote">``You

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know I am quite myself. And the man we have in hiding down the river,

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Chapter LI

<p/>What purpose I had in view when I was hot on tracing out and proving
Estella's parentage, I cannot say. It will presently be seen that the
question was not before me in a distinct shape until it was put before
me by a wiser head than my own.

<p/>But when Herbert and I had held our momentous conversation, I was seized
with a feverish conviction that I ought to hunt the matter down,--that I
ought not to let it rest, but that I ought to see Mr. Jaggers, and come
at the bare truth. I really do not know whether I felt that I did this
for Estella's sake, or whether I was glad to transfer to the man in
whose preservation I was so much concerned some rays of the romantic
interest that had so long surrounded me. Perhaps the latter possibility
may be the nearer to the truth.

<p/>Any way, I could scarcely be withheld from going out to Gerrard Street
that night. Herbert's representations that, if I did, I should probably
be laid up and stricken useless, when our fugitive's safety would depend
upon me, alone restrained my impatience. On the understanding, again
and again reiterated, that, come what would, I was to go to Mr. Jaggers
to-morrow, I at length submitted to keep quiet, and to have my hurts
looked after, and to stay at home. Early next morning we went out
together, and at the corner of Giltspur Street by Smithfield, I left
Herbert to go his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) way into the City, and took my way to Little Britain.

<p/>There were periodical occasions when Mr. Jaggers and Wemmick went over
the office accounts, and checked off the vouchers, and put all things
straight. On these occasions, Wemmick took his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) books and papers into Mr.
Jaggers's room, and one of the upstairs clerks came down into the outer
office. Finding such clerk on Wemmick's post that morning, I knew
what was going on; but I was not sorry to have Mr. Jaggers and Wemmick
together, as Wemmick would then hear for himself that I said nothing to
compromise him (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>).

<p/>My appearance, with my arm bandaged and my coat loose over my shoulders,
favored my object. Although I had sent Mr. Jaggers a brief account of
the accident as soon as I had arrived in town, yet I had to give him (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) all
the details now; and the speciality of the occasion caused our talk
to be less dry and hard, and less strictly regulated by the rules of
evidence, than it had been before. While I described the disaster, Mr.
Jaggers stood, according to his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) wont, before the fire. Wemmick leaned
back in his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) chair, staring at me, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) hands in the pockets of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>)
trousers, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) pen put horizontally into the post. The two brutal
casts, always inseparable in my mind from the official proceedings,
seemed to be congestively considering whether they didn't smell fire at
the present moment.

<p/>My narrative finished, and their questions exhausted, I then produced
Miss Havisham's authority to receive the nine hundred pounds for
Herbert. Mr. Jaggers's eyes retired a little deeper into his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) head when
I handed him (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) the tablets, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) presently handed them over to Wemmick,
with instructions to draw the check for his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) signature. While that was
in course of being done, I looked on at Wemmick as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) wrote, and Mr.
Jaggers, poising and swaying himself on his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) well-polished boots, looked
on at me. <div class="bookquote">``I am sorry, Pip,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>), as I put the check in my pocket,
when he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) had signed it, <div class="bookquote">``that we do nothing for you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Havisham was good enough to ask me,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I returned, <div class="bookquote">``whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>)
could do nothing for me, and I told her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) No.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Everybody should know his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) own business,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jaggers/Jaggers/MR. JAGGERS</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Jaggers. And I saw
Wemmick's lips form the words <div class="bookquote">``portable property.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should not have told her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) No, if I had been you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr Jaggers/Jaggers</b></font>)</div>said Mr Jaggers;
<div class="bookquote">``but every man ought to know his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own business best.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr Jaggers/Jaggers</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Every man's business,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div>said Wemmick, rather reproachfully towards me,
<div class="bookquote">``is portable property.''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>As I thought the time was now come for pursuing the theme I had at
heart, I said, turning on Mr. Jaggers:--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I did ask something of Miss Havisham, however, sir. I asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) to give
me some information relative to her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) adopted daughter, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) gave me
all she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) possessed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jaggers/Jaggers/MR. JAGGERS</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jaggers/Jaggers/MR. JAGGERS</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Jaggers, bending forward to look at his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) boots and
then straightening himself. <div class="bookquote">``Hah! I don't think I should have done so,
if I had been Miss Havisham. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) ought to know her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) own business
best.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know more of the history of Miss Havisham's adopted child than Miss
Havisham herself does, sir. I know her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) mother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jaggers/Jaggers/MR. JAGGERS</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Jaggers looked at me inquiringly, and repeated <div class="bookquote">``Mother?''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) mother within these three days.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jaggers/Jaggers/MR. JAGGERS</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Jaggers.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And so have you, sir. And you have seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) still more recently.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jaggers/Jaggers/MR. JAGGERS</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Jaggers.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps I know more of Estella's history than even you do,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I. <div class="bookquote">``I
know her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) father too.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div><p/>A certain stop that Mr. Jaggers came to in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) manner--he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) was too
self-possessed to change his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) manner, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) could not help its being
brought to an indefinably attentive stop--assured me that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) did not
know who her (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) father was. This I had strongly suspected from Provis's
account -LRB-as Herbert had repeated it-RRB- of his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) having kept himself dark;
which I pieced on to the fact that he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) himself was not Mr. Jaggers's
client until some four years later, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) could have no reason for
claiming his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) identity. But, I could not be sure of this unconsciousness
on Mr. Jaggers's part before, though I was quite sure of it now.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So! You know the young lady's father, Pip?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jaggers/Jaggers/MR. JAGGERS</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Jaggers.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I replied, <div class="bookquote">``and his (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) name is Provis--from New South Wales.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Even Mr. Jaggers started when I said those words. It was the slightest
start that could escape a man, the most carefully repressed and the
sooner checked, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) did start, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) made it a part of the
action of taking out his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) pocket-handkerchief. How Wemmick received the
announcement I am unable to say; for I was afraid to look at him (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) just
then, lest Mr. Jaggers's sharpness should detect that there had been
some communication unknown to him (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) between us.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And on what evidence, Pip,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jaggers/Jaggers/MR. JAGGERS</b></font>)</div>asked Mr. Jaggers, very coolly, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>)
paused with his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) handkerchief half way to his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) nose, <div class="bookquote">``does Provis make
this claim?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Provis</b></font>) does not make it,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, <div class="bookquote">``and has never made it, and has no
knowledge or belief that his (<font color='blue'><b>Provis</b></font>) daughter is in existence.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>For once, the powerful pocket-handkerchief failed. My reply was so
unexpected, that Mr. Jaggers put the handkerchief back into his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) pocket
without completing the usual performance, folded his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) arms, and looked
with stern attention at me, though with an immovable face.

<p/>Then I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) all I knew, and how I knew it; with the one reservation
that I left him (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) to infer that I knew from Miss Havisham what I in fact
knew from Wemmick. I was very careful indeed as to that. Nor did I look
towards Wemmick until I had finished all I had to tell, and had been for
some time silently meeting Mr. Jaggers's look. When I did at last turn
my eyes in Wemmick's direction, I found that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) had unposted his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) pen,
and was intent upon the table before him (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hah!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jaggers/Jaggers/MR. JAGGERS</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Jaggers at last, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) moved towards the papers on the
table. <div class="bookquote">``What item was it you were at, Wemmick, when Mr. Pip came in?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>But I could not submit to be thrown off in that way, and I made a
passionate, almost an indignant appeal, to him (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) to be more frank and
manly with me. I reminded him (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) of the false hopes into which I had
lapsed, the length of time they had lasted, and the discovery I had
made: and I hinted at the danger that weighed upon my spirits. I
represented myself as being surely worthy of some little confidence from
him (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>), in return for the confidence I had just now imparted. I said that
I did not blame him (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>), or suspect him (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>), or mistrust him (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>), but I wanted
assurance of the truth from him (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>). And if he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) asked me why I wanted it,
and why I thought I had any right to it, I would tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>), little as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>)
cared for such poor dreams, that I had loved Estella dearly and long,
and that although I had lost her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>), and must live a bereaved life,
whatever concerned her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) was still nearer and dearer to me than anything
else in the world. And seeing that Mr. Jaggers stood quite still and
silent, and apparently quite obdurate, under this appeal, I turned to
Wemmick, and said, <div class="bookquote">``Wemmick, I know you to be a man with a gentle
heart. I have seen your pleasant home, and your old father, and all the
innocent, cheerful playful ways with which you refresh your business
life. And I entreat you to say a word for me to Mr. Jaggers, and to
represent to him (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) that, all circumstances considered, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) ought to be more
open with me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I have never seen two men look more oddly at one another than Mr.
Jaggers and Wemmick did after this apostrophe. At first, a misgiving
crossed me that Wemmick would be instantly dismissed from his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>)
employment; but it melted as I saw Mr. Jaggers relax into something like
a smile, and Wemmick become bolder.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What's all this?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jaggers/Jaggers/MR. JAGGERS</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Jaggers. <div class="bookquote">``You with an old father, and you
with pleasant and playful ways?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well!''  (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div>returned Wemmick. <div class="bookquote">``If I don't bring `em here, what does it
matter?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pip,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jaggers/Jaggers/MR. JAGGERS</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Jaggers, laying his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) hand upon my arm, and smiling
openly, <div class="bookquote">``this man must be the most cunning impostor in all London.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jaggers/Jaggers/MR. JAGGERS</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not a bit of it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div>returned Wemmick, growing bolder and bolder. <div class="bookquote">``I think
you're another.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>Again they exchanged their former odd looks, each apparently still
distrustful that the other was taking him (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) in.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You with a pleasant home?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jaggers/Jaggers/MR. JAGGERS</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Jaggers.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Since it don't interfere with business,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div>returned Wemmick, <div class="bookquote">``let it be
so. Now, I look at you, sir, I shouldn't wonder if you might be planning
and contriving to have a pleasant home of your own one of these days,
when you're tired of all this work.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Jaggers nodded his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) head retrospectively two or three times, and
actually drew a sigh. <div class="bookquote">``Pip,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``we won't talk about `poor
dreams;' you know more about such things than I, having much fresher
experience of that kind. But now about this other matter. I'll put a
case to you. Mind! I admit nothing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) waited for me to declare that I quite understood that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) expressly
said that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) admitted nothing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, Pip,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jaggers/Jaggers/MR. JAGGERS</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Jaggers, <div class="bookquote">``put this case. Put the case that a
woman, under such circumstances as you have mentioned, held her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) child
concealed, and was obliged to communicate the fact to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) legal adviser,
on his (<font color='blue'><b>adviser</b></font>) representing to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>adviser</b></font>) must know, with an eye to the
latitude of his (<font color='blue'><b>adviser</b></font>) defence, how the fact stood about that child. Put the

no stir about; as to whom, over the mother, the legal adviser had this
power: ``I know what you did, and how you did it. You came so and so, you
did such and such things to divert suspicion. I have tracked you through
it all, and I tell it you all. Part with the child, unless it should
be necessary to produce it to clear you, and then it shall be produced.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That you make no admissions.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>And Wemmick repeated, <div class="bookquote">``No admissions.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Put the case, Pip, that passion and the terror of death had a little
shaken the woman's intellects, and that when she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was set at liberty,

sheltered. Put the case that he (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) took her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) in, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) kept down the
old, wild, violent nature whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) saw an inkling of its breaking
out, by asserting his (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) power over her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) in the old way. Do you comprehend

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Quite.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Put the case that the child grew up, and was married for money. That

still a secret, except that you had got wind of it. Put that last case
to yourself very carefully.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I ask Wemmick to put it to himself very carefully.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div><p/>And Wemmick said, <div class="bookquote">``I do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``For whose sake would you reveal the secret? For the father's? I think
he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) would not be much the better for the mother. For the mother's? I
think if she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had done such a deed she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) would be safer where she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was.
For the daughter's? I think it would hardly serve her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) to establish her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
parentage for the information of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) husband, and to drag her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) back to
disgrace, after an escape of twenty years, pretty secure to last for
life. But add the case that you had loved her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), Pip, and had made her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) the
subject of those `poor dreams' which have, at one time or another, been
in the heads of more men than you think likely, then I tell you that you
had better--and would much sooner when you had thought well of it--chop
off that bandaged left hand of yours with your bandaged right hand, and
then pass the chopper on to Wemmick there, to cut that off too.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I looked at Wemmick, whose face was very grave. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) gravely touched his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>)
lips with his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) forefinger. I did the same. Mr. Jaggers did the same.
<div class="bookquote">``Now, Wemmick,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the latter then, resuming his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) usual manner, <div class="bookquote">``what
item was it you were at when Mr. Pip came in?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Standing by for a little, while they were at work, I observed that the
odd looks they had cast at one another were repeated several times: with
this difference now, that each of them seemed suspicious, not to say
conscious, of having shown himself in a weak and unprofessional light to
the other. For this reason, I suppose, they were now inflexible with one
another; Mr. Jaggers being highly dictatorial, and Wemmick obstinately
justifying himself whenever there was the smallest point in abeyance for
a moment. I had never seen them on such ill terms; for generally they
got on very well indeed together.

<p/>But they were both happily relieved by the opportune appearance of Mike,
the client with the fur cap and the habit of wiping his (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) nose on his (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>)
sleeve, whom I had seen on the very first day of my appearance within
those walls. This individual, who, either in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) own person or in that
of some member of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) family, seemed to be always in trouble -LRB-which in
that place meant Newgate-RRB-, called to announce that his (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) eldest daughter
was taken up on suspicion of shoplifting. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) imparted this melancholy
circumstance to Wemmick, Mr. Jaggers standing magisterially before the
fire and taking no share in the proceedings, Mike's eye happened to
twinkle with a tear.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What are you about?''  (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div>demanded Wemmick, with the utmost indignation.
<div class="bookquote">``What do you come snivelling here for?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I didn't go to do it, Mr. Wemmick.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You did,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div>said Wemmick. <div class="bookquote">``How dare you? You're not in a fit state to
come here, if you can't come here without spluttering like a bad pen.
What do you mean by it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A man can't help his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) feelings, Mr. Wemmick,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mike</b></font>)</div>pleaded Mike.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``His (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) what?''  (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div>demanded Wemmick, quite savagely. <div class="bookquote">``Say that again!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now look here my man,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jaggers/Jaggers/MR. JAGGERS</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Jaggers, advancing a step, and pointing
to the door. <div class="bookquote">``Get out of this office. I'll have no feelings here. Get
out.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It serves you right,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div>said Wemmick, <div class="bookquote">``Get out.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div><p/>So, the unfortunate Mike very humbly withdrew, and Mr. Jaggers and
Wemmick appeared to have re-established their good understanding, and
went to work again with an air of refreshment upon them as if they had
just had lunch.




<p/>Chapter LII


<p/>From Little Britain I went, with my check in my pocket, to Miss
Skiffins's brother, the accountant; and Miss Skiffins's brother, the
accountant, going straight to Clarriker's and bringing Clarriker to me,
I had the great satisfaction of concluding that arrangement. It was the
only good thing I had done, and the only completed thing I had done,
since I was first apprised of my great expectations.

<p/>Clarriker informing me on that occasion that the affairs of the House
were steadily progressing, that he (<font color='blue'><b>accountant</b></font>) would now be able to establish a
small branch-house in the East which was much wanted for the extension
of the business, and that Herbert in his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) new partnership capacity would
go out and take charge of it, I found that I must have prepared for
a separation from my friend, even though my own affairs had been more
settled. And now, indeed, I felt as if my last anchor were loosening its
hold, and I should soon be driving with the winds and waves.

<p/>But there was recompense in the joy with which Herbert would come home
of a night and tell me of these changes, little imagining that he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) told
me no news, and would sketch airy pictures of himself conducting Clara
Barley to the land of the Arabian Nights, and of me going out to join
them -LRB-with a caravan of camels, I believe-RRB-, and of our all going up the
Nile and seeing wonders. Without being sanguine as to my own part in
those bright plans, I felt that Herbert's way was clearing fast, and
that old Bill Barley had but to stick to his (<font color='blue'><b>Barley</b></font>) pepper and rum, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Barley</b></font>)
daughter would soon be happily provided for.

<p/>We had now got into the month of March. My left arm, though it presented
no bad symptoms, took, in the natural course, so long to heal that I
was still unable to get a coat on. My right arm was tolerably restored;
disfigured, but fairly serviceable.

<p/>On a Monday morning, when Herbert and I were at breakfast, I received
the following letter from Wemmick by the post.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Walworth. Burn this as soon as read. Early in the week, or say
Wednesday, you might do what you know of, if you felt disposed to try
it. Now burn.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>When I had shown this to Herbert and had put it in the fire--but not
before we had both got it by heart--we considered what to do. For, of
course my being disabled could now be no longer kept out of view.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have thought it over again and again,''  (<font color='red'><b>Herbert/Herbert Pocket</b></font>)</div>said Herbert, <div class="bookquote">``and I think I
know a better course than taking a Thames waterman. Take Startop. A good
fellow, a skilled hand, fond of us, and enthusiastic and honorable.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Herbert/Herbert Pocket</b></font>)</div><p/>I had thought of him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) more than once.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But how much would you tell him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>), Herbert?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is necessary to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) very little. Let him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) suppose it a mere
freak, but a secret one, until the morning comes: then let him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) know that
there is urgent reason for your getting Provis aboard and away. You go
with him (<font color='blue'><b>Provis</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No doubt.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Where?''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>It had seemed to me, in the many anxious considerations I had given the
point, almost indifferent what port we made for,--Hamburg, Rotterdam,
Antwerp,--the place signified little, so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) was out of England. Any
foreign steamer that fell in our way and would take us up would do.
I had always proposed to myself to get him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) well down the river in the
boat; certainly well beyond Gravesend, which was a critical place for
search or inquiry if suspicion were afoot. As foreign steamers would
leave London at about the time of high-water, our plan would be to get
down the river by a previous ebb-tide, and lie by in some quiet spot
until we could pull off to one. The time when one would be due where we
lay, wherever that might be, could be calculated pretty nearly, if we
made inquiries beforehand.

<p/>Herbert assented to all this, and we went out immediately after
breakfast to pursue our investigations. We found that a steamer for
Hamburg was likely to suit our purpose best, and we directed our
thoughts chiefly to that vessel. But we noted down what other foreign
steamers would leave London with the same tide, and we satisfied
ourselves that we knew the build and color of each. We then separated
for a few hours: I, to get at once such passports as were necessary;
Herbert, to see Startop at his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) lodgings. We both did what we had to do
without any hindrance, and when we met again at one o’clock reported
it done. I, for my part, was prepared with passports; Herbert had seen
Startop, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) was more than ready to join.

<p/>Those two should pull a pair of oars, we settled, and I would steer; our
charge would be sitter, and keep quiet; as speed was not our object, we
should make way enough. We arranged that Herbert should not come home to
dinner before going to Mill Pond Bank that evening; that he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) should
not go there at all to-morrow evening, Tuesday; that he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) should prepare
Provis to come down to some stairs hard by the house, on Wednesday, when
he (<font color='blue'><b>Provis</b></font>) saw us approach, and not sooner; that all the arrangements with
him (<font color='blue'><b>Provis</b></font>) should be concluded that Monday night; and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Provis</b></font>) should be
communicated with no more in any way, until we took him (<font color='blue'><b>Provis</b></font>) on board.

<p/>These precautions well understood by both of us, I went home.

<p/>On opening the outer door of our chambers with my key, I found a letter
in the box, directed to me; a very dirty letter, though not ill-written.
It had been delivered by hand -LRB-of course, since I left home-RRB-, and its
contents were these:--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you are not afraid to come to the old marshes to-night or to-morrow
night at nine, and to come to the little sluice-house by the limekiln,
you had better come. If you want information regarding your uncle
Provis, you had much better come and tell no one, and lose no time. You
must come alone. Bring this with you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I had had load enough upon my mind before the receipt of this strange
letter. What to do now, I could not tell. And the worst was, that I must
decide quickly, or I should miss the afternoon coach, which would take
me down in time for to-night. To-morrow night I could not think of
going, for it would be too close upon the time of the flight. And again,
for anything I knew, the proffered information might have some important
bearing on the flight itself.

<p/>If I had had ample time for consideration, I believe I should still have
gone. Having hardly any time for consideration,--my watch showing me
that the coach started within half an hour,--I resolved to go. I should
certainly not have gone, but for the reference to my Uncle Provis. That,
coming on Wemmick's letter and the morning's busy preparation, turned
the scale.

<p/>It is so difficult to become clearly possessed of the contents of almost
any letter, in a violent hurry, that I had to read this mysterious
epistle again twice, before its injunction to me to be secret got
mechanically into my mind. Yielding to it in the same mechanical kind of
way, I left a note in pencil for Herbert, telling him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) that as I should
be so soon going away, I knew not for how long, I had decided to hurry
down and back, to ascertain for myself how Miss Havisham was faring.
I had then barely time to get my great-coat, lock up the chambers,
and make for the coach-office by the short by-ways. If I had taken a
hackney-chariot and gone by the streets, I should have missed my aim;
going as I did, I caught the coach just as it came out of the yard. I
was the only inside passenger, jolting away knee-deep in straw, when I
came to myself.

<p/>For I really had not been myself since the receipt of the letter; it had
so bewildered me, ensuing on the hurry of the morning. The morning hurry
and flutter had been great; for, long and anxiously as I had waited for
Wemmick, his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) hint had come like a surprise at last. And now I began
to wonder at myself for being in the coach, and to doubt whether I had
sufficient reason for being there, and to consider whether I should
get out presently and go back, and to argue against ever heeding an
anonymous communication, and, in short, to pass through all those phases
of contradiction and indecision to which I suppose very few hurried
people are strangers. Still, the reference to Provis by name mastered
everything. I reasoned as I had reasoned already without knowing it,--if
that be reasoning,--in case any harm should befall him (<font color='blue'><b>Provis</b></font>) through my not
going, how could I ever forgive myself!

<p/>It was dark before we got down, and the journey seemed long and dreary
to me, who could see little of it inside, and who could not go outside
in my disabled state. Avoiding the Blue Boar, I put up at an inn of
minor reputation down the town, and ordered some dinner. While it was
preparing, I went to Satis House and inquired for Miss Havisham; she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) was
still very ill, though considered something better.

<p/>My inn had once been a part of an ancient ecclesiastical house, and I
dined in a little octagonal common-room, like a font. As I was not able
to cut my dinner, the old landlord with a shining bald head did it for
me. This bringing us into conversation, he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) was so good as to entertain
me with my own story,--of course with the popular feature that
Pumblechook was my earliest benefactor and the founder of my fortunes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you know the young man?''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Know him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>repeated the landlord. <div class="bookquote">``Ever since he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was--no height at
all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Does he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ever come back to this neighborhood?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) comes back,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the landlord, <div class="bookquote">``to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) great friends, now and
again, and gives the cold shoulder to the man that made him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What man is that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) that I speak of,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the landlord. <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Pumblechook.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is he (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) ungrateful to no one else?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No doubt he (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) would be, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) could,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>returned the landlord, <div class="bookquote">``but he (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>)
can't. And why? Because Pumblechook done everything for him (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Does Pumblechook say so?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Say so!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>replied the landlord. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) han't no call to say so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But does he (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) say so?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It would turn a man's blood to white wine winegar to hear him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) tell of
it, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said the landlord.

<p/>I thought, <div class="bookquote">``Yet Joe, dear Joe, you never tell of it. Long-suffering and
loving Joe, you never complain. Nor you, sweet-tempered Biddy!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Your appetite's been touched like by your accident,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the landlord,
glancing at the bandaged arm under my coat. <div class="bookquote">``Try a tenderer bit.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, thank you,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I replied, turning from the table to brood over the
fire. <div class="bookquote">``I can eat no more. Please take it away.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I had never been struck at so keenly, for my thanklessness to Joe, as
through the brazen impostor Pumblechook. The falser he (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>), the truer Joe;
the meaner he (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>), the nobler Joe.

<p/>My heart was deeply and most deservedly humbled as I mused over the fire
for an hour or more. The striking of the clock aroused me, but not from
my dejection or remorse, and I got up and had my coat fastened round
my neck, and went out. I had previously sought in my pockets for the
letter, that I might refer to it again; but I could not find it, and
was uneasy to think that it must have been dropped in the straw of
the coach. I knew very well, however, that the appointed place was the
little sluice-house by the limekiln on the marshes, and the hour nine.
Towards the marshes I now went straight, having no time to spare.




<p/>Chapter LIII

<p/>It was a dark night, though the full moon rose as I left the enclosed
lands, and passed out upon the marshes. Beyond their dark line there was
a ribbon of clear sky, hardly broad enough to hold the red large moon.
In a few minutes she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) had ascended out of that clear field, in among the
piled mountains of cloud.

<p/>There was a melancholy wind, and the marshes were very dismal. A
stranger would have found them insupportable, and even to me they were
so oppressive that I hesitated, half inclined to go back. But I knew
them well, and could have found my way on a far darker night, and had
no excuse for returning, being there. So, having come there against my
inclination, I went on against it.

<p/>The direction that I took was not that in which my old home lay, nor
that in which we had pursued the convicts. My back was turned towards
the distant Hulks as I walked on, and, though I could see the old lights
away on the spits of sand, I saw them over my shoulder. I knew the
limekiln as well as I knew the old Battery, but they were miles apart;
so that, if a light had been burning at each point that night, there
would have been a long strip of the blank horizon between the two bright
specks.

<p/>At first, I had to shut some gates after me, and now and then to stand
still while the cattle that were lying in the banked-up pathway arose
and blundered down among the grass and reeds. But after a little while I
seemed to have the whole flats to myself.

<p/>It was another half-hour before I drew near to the kiln. The lime was
burning with a sluggish stifling smell, but the fires were made up and
left, and no workmen were visible. Hard by was a small stone-quarry. It
lay directly in my way, and had been worked that day, as I saw by the
tools and barrows that were lying about.

<p/>Coming up again to the marsh level out of this excavation,--for the rude
path lay through it,--I saw a light in the old sluice-house. I quickened
my pace, and knocked at the door with my hand. Waiting for some reply,
I looked about me, noticing how the sluice was abandoned and broken, and
how the house--of wood with a tiled roof--would not be proof against the
weather much longer, if it were so even now, and how the mud and ooze
were coated with lime, and how the choking vapor of the kiln crept in a
ghostly way towards me. Still there was no answer, and I knocked again.
No answer still, and I tried the latch.

<p/>It rose under my hand, and the door yielded. Looking in, I saw a lighted
candle on a table, a bench, and a mattress on a truckle bedstead. As
there was a loft above, I called, <div class="bookquote">``Is there any one here?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>but no voice
answered. Then I looked at my watch, and, finding that it was past nine,
called again, <div class="bookquote">``Is there any one here?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>There being still no answer, I
went out at the door, irresolute what to do.

<p/>It was beginning to rain fast. Seeing nothing save what I had seen
already, I turned back into the house, and stood just within the shelter
of the doorway, looking out into the night. While I was considering that
some one must have been there lately and must soon be coming back, or
the candle would not be burning, it came into my head to look if the
wick were long. I turned round to do so, and had taken up the candle in
my hand, when it was extinguished by some violent shock; and the next
thing I comprehended was, that I had been caught in a strong running
noose, thrown over my head from behind.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said a suppressed voice with an oath, <div class="bookquote">``I've got you!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What is this?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I cried, struggling. <div class="bookquote">``Who is it? Help, help, help!''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>Not only were my arms pulled close to my sides, but the pressure on
my bad arm caused me exquisite pain. Sometimes, a strong man's hand,
sometimes a strong man's breast, was set against my mouth to deaden
my cries, and with a hot breath always close to me, I struggled
ineffectually in the dark, while I was fastened tight to the wall. <div class="bookquote">``And
now,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the suppressed voice with another oath, <div class="bookquote">``call out again, and
I'll make short work of you!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Faint and sick with the pain of my injured arm, bewildered by the
surprise, and yet conscious how easily this threat could be put in
execution, I desisted, and tried to ease my arm were it ever so little.
But, it was bound too tight for that. I felt as if, having been burnt
before, it were now being boiled.

<p/>The sudden exclusion of the night, and the substitution of black
darkness in its place, warned me that the man had closed a shutter.
After groping about for a little, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) found the flint and steel he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
wanted, and began to strike a light. I strained my sight upon the sparks
that fell among the tinder, and upon which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) breathed and breathed,
match in hand, but I could only see his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lips, and the blue point of
the match; even those but fitfully. The tinder was damp,--no wonder
there,--and one after another the sparks died out.

<p/>The man was in no hurry, and struck again with the flint and steel. As
the sparks fell thick and bright about him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), I could see his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hands, and
touches of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face, and could make out that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was seated and bending
over the table; but nothing more. Presently I saw his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) blue lips again,
breathing on the tinder, and then a flare of light flashed up, and
showed me Orlick.

<p/>Whom I had looked for, I don't know. I had not looked for him (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>). Seeing
him (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>), I felt that I was in a dangerous strait indeed, and I kept my eyes
upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>).

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) lighted the candle from the flaring match with great deliberation,
and dropped the match, and trod it out. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) put the candle away from
him (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) on the table, so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) could see me, and sat with his (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) arms folded
on the table and looked at me. I made out that I was fastened to a stout
perpendicular ladder a few inches from the wall,--a fixture there,--the
means of ascent to the loft above.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>), when we had surveyed one another for some time, <div class="bookquote">``I've
got you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Unbind me. Let me go!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) returned, <div class="bookquote">``I'll let you go. I'll let you go to the moon, I'll
let you go to the stars. All in good time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why have you lured me here?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't you know?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>), with a deadly look.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why have you set upon me in the dark?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because I mean to do it all myself. One keeps a secret better than two.
O you enemy, you enemy!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) enjoyment of the spectacle I furnished, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) sat with his (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) arms
folded on the table, shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) head at me and hugging himself, had a
malignity in it that made me tremble. As I watched him (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) in silence,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) put his (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) hand into the corner at his (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) side, and took up a gun with a
brass-bound stock.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you know this?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>), making as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) would take aim at me. <div class="bookquote">``Do
you know where you saw it afore? Speak, wolf!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I answered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You cost me that place. You did. Speak!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What else could I do?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You did that, and that would be enough, without more. How dared you to
come betwixt me and a young woman I liked?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``When did I?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``When didn't you? It was you as always give Old Orlick a bad name to
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You gave it to yourself; you gained it for yourself. I could have done
you no harm, if you had done yourself none.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You're a liar. And you'll take any pains, and spend any money, to drive
me out of this country, will you?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>), repeating my words to Biddy
in the last interview I had with her (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Now, I'll tell you a piece of
information. It was never so well worth your while to get me out of this
country as it is to-night. Ah! If it was all your money twenty times
told, to the last brass farden!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) heavy hand at me, with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) mouth snarling like a tiger's, I felt that it was true.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What are you going to do to me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm a going,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>), bringing his (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) fist down upon the table with a
heavy blow, and rising as the blow fell to give it greater force,--<div class="bookquote">``I'm
a going to have your life!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) leaned forward staring at me, slowly unclenched his (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) hand and drew it
across his (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) mouth as if his (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) mouth watered for me, and sat down again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You was always in Old Orlick's way since ever you was a child. You goes
out of his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) way this present night. He (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)'ll have no more on you. You're
dead.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I felt that I had come to the brink of my grave. For a moment I looked
wildly round my trap for any chance of escape; but there was none.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``More than that,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>), folding his (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) arms on the table again, <div class="bookquote">``I won't
have a rag of you, I won't have a bone of you, left on earth. I'll put
your body in the kiln,--I'd carry two such to it, on my Shoulders,--and,
let people suppose what they may of you, they shall never know nothing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>My mind, with inconceivable rapidity followed out all the consequences
of such a death. Estella's father would believe I had deserted him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>),
would be taken, would die accusing me; even Herbert would doubt me,
when he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) compared the letter I had left for him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) with the fact that I had
called at Miss Havisham's gate for only a moment; Joe and Biddy would
never know how sorry I had been that night, none would ever know what
I had suffered, how true I had meant to be, what an agony I had passed
through. The death close before me was terrible, but far more terrible
than death was the dread of being misremembered after death. And
so quick were my thoughts, that I saw myself despised by unborn
generations,--Estella's children, and their children,--while the
wretch's words were yet on his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) lips.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, wolf,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``afore I kill you like any other beast,--which is
wot I mean to do and wot I have tied you up for,--I'll have a good look
at you and a good goad at you. O you enemy!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>It had passed through my thoughts to cry out for help again; though
few could know better than I, the solitary nature of the spot, and the
hopelessness of aid. But as he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) sat gloating over me, I was supported by
a scornful detestation of him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) that sealed my lips. Above all things, I
resolved that I would not entreat him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), and that I would die making some
last poor resistance to him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>). Softened as my thoughts of all the rest of
men were in that dire extremity; humbly beseeching pardon, as I did, of
Heaven; melted at heart, as I was, by the thought that I had taken no
farewell, and never now could take farewell of those who were dear to
me, or could explain myself to them, or ask for their compassion on my
miserable errors,--still, if I could have killed him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), even in dying, I
would have done it.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) had been drinking, and his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) eyes were red and bloodshot. Around his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)
neck was slung a tin bottle, as I had often seen his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) meat and drink
slung about him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) in other days. He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) brought the bottle to his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) lips, and
took a fiery drink from it; and I smelt the strong spirits that I saw
flash into his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Wolf!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), folding his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) arms again, <div class="bookquote">``Old Orlick's a going to tell
you somethink. It was you as did for your shrew sister.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Again my mind, with its former inconceivable rapidity, had exhausted the
whole subject of the attack upon my sister, her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) illness, and her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) death,
before his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) slow and hesitating speech had formed these words.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It was you, villain,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I tell you it was your doing,--I tell you it was done through you,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)
retorted, catching up the gun, and making a blow with the stock at the
vacant air between us. <div class="bookquote">``I come upon her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) from behind, as I come upon you
to-night. I giv' it her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)! I left her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) for dead, and if there had been a
limekiln as nigh her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) as there is now nigh you, she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) shouldn't have come
to life again. But it warn't Old Orlick as did it; it was you. You was
favored, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) was bullied and beat. Old Orlick bullied and beat, eh?
Now you pays for it. You done it; now you pays for it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) drank again, and became more ferocious. I saw by his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) tilting of
the bottle that there was no great quantity left in it. I distinctly
understood that he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) was working himself up with its contents to make an
end of me. I knew that every drop it held was a drop of my life. I knew
that when I was changed into a part of the vapor that had crept towards
me but a little while before, like my own warning ghost, he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) would do
as he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) had done in my sister's case,--make all haste to the town, and
be seen slouching about there drinking at the alehouses. My rapid mind
pursued him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) to the town, made a picture of the street with him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) in it,
and contrasted its lights and life with the lonely marsh and the white
vapor creeping over it, into which I should have dissolved.

<p/>It was not only that I could have summed up years and years and years
while he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) said a dozen words, but that what he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) did say presented pictures
to me, and not mere words. In the excited and exalted state of my brain,
I could not think of a place without seeing it, or of persons without
seeing them. It is impossible to overstate the vividness of these
images, and yet I was so intent, all the time, upon him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) himself,--who
would not be intent on the tiger crouching to spring!--that I knew of
the slightest action of his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) fingers.

<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) had drunk this second time, he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) rose from the bench on which
he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) sat, and pushed the table aside. Then, he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) took up the candle, and,
shading it with his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) murderous hand so as to throw its light on me, stood
before me, looking at me and enjoying the sight.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Wolf, I'll tell you something more. It was Old Orlick as you tumbled
over on your stairs that night.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I saw the staircase with its extinguished lamps. I saw the shadows of
the heavy stair-rails, thrown by the watchman's lantern on the wall.
I saw the rooms that I was never to see again; here, a door half open;
there, a door closed; all the articles of furniture around.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And why was Old Orlick there? I'll tell you something more, wolf.
You and her (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) have pretty well hunted me out of this country, so far as
getting a easy living in it goes, and I've took up with new companions,
and new masters. Some of `em writes my letters when I wants `em
wrote,--do you mind?--writes my letters, wolf! They writes fifty hands;
they're not like sneaking you, as writes but one. I've had a firm mind
and a firm will to have your life, since you was down here at your
sister's burying. I han't seen a way to get you safe, and I've looked
arter you to know your ins and outs. For, says Old Orlick to himself,
`Somehow or another I'll have him (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>)!' What! When I looks for you, I finds
your uncle Provis, eh?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Green</b></font>)</div><p/>Mill Pond Bank, and Chinks's Basin, and the Old Green Copper Rope-walk,
all so clear and plain! Provis in his (<font color='blue'><b>Provis</b></font>) rooms, the signal whose use was
over, pretty Clara, the good motherly woman, old Bill Barley on his (<font color='blue'><b>Barley</b></font>)
back, all drifting by, as on the swift stream of my life fast running
out to sea!

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You with a uncle too! Why, I know'd you at Gargery's when you was so
small a wolf that I could have took your weazen betwixt this finger and
thumb and chucked you away dead -LRB-as I'd thoughts o' doing, odd times,
when I see you loitering amongst the pollards on a Sunday-RRB-, and you
hadn't found no uncles then. No, not you! But when Old Orlick come for
to hear that your uncle Provis had most like wore the leg-iron wot Old
Orlick had picked up, filed asunder, on these meshes ever so many year
ago, and wot he (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) kep by him (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) till he (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) dropped your sister with it, like
a bullock, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) means to drop you--hey?--when he (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) come for to hear
that--hey?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>In his (<font color='blue'><b>Barley</b></font>) savage taunting, he (<font color='blue'><b>Barley</b></font>) flared the candle so close at me that I
turned my face aside to save it from the flame.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Barley</b></font>) cried, laughing, after doing it again, <div class="bookquote">``the burnt child dreads
the fire! Old Orlick knowed you was burnt, Old Orlick knowed you was
smuggling your uncle Provis away, Old Orlick's a match for you and
know'd you'd come to-night! Now I'll tell you something more, wolf, and
this ends it. There's them that's as good a match for your uncle Provis
as Old Orlick has been for you. Let him (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) `ware them, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>)'s lost his (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>)
nevvy! Let him (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) `ware them, when no man can't find a rag of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) dear
relation's clothes, nor yet a bone of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) body. There's them that can't
and that won't have Magwitch,--yes, I know the name!--alive in the same
land with them, and that's had such sure information of him (<font color='blue'><b>Magwitch</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>Magwitch</b></font>)
was alive in another land, as that he (<font color='blue'><b>Magwitch</b></font>) couldn't and shouldn't leave it
unbeknown and put them in danger. P’raps it's them that writes fifty
hands, and that's not like sneaking you as writes but one. `Ware
Compeyson, Magwitch, and the gallows!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Barley</b></font>) flared the candle at me again, smoking my face and hair, and for an
instant blinding me, and turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Barley</b></font>) powerful back as he (<font color='blue'><b>Barley</b></font>) replaced the
light on the table. I had thought a prayer, and had been with Joe and
Biddy and Herbert, before he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) turned towards me again.

<p/>There was a clear space of a few feet between the table and the opposite
wall. Within this space, he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) now slouched backwards and forwards. His (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>)
great strength seemed to sit stronger upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) than ever before, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>)
did this with his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) hands hanging loose and heavy at his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) sides, and with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) eyes scowling at me. I had no grain of hope left. Wild as my inward
hurry was, and wonderful the force of the pictures that rushed by me
instead of thoughts, I could yet clearly understand that, unless he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) had
resolved that I was within a few moments of surely perishing out of all
human knowledge, he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) would never have told me what he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) had told.

<p/>Of a sudden, he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) stopped, took the cork out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) bottle, and tossed
it away. Light as it was, I heard it fall like a plummet. He (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) swallowed
slowly, tilting up the bottle by little and little, and now he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) looked at
me no more. The last few drops of liquor he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) poured into the palm of his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>)
hand, and licked up. Then, with a sudden hurry of violence and swearing
horribly, he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) threw the bottle from him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>), and stooped; and I saw in his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>)
hand a stone-hammer with a long heavy handle.

<p/>The resolution I had made did not desert me, for, without uttering
one vain word of appeal to him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>), I shouted out with all my might, and
struggled with all my might. It was only my head and my legs that I
could move, but to that extent I struggled with all the force, until
then unknown, that was within me. In the same instant I heard responsive
shouts, saw figures and a gleam of light dash in at the door, heard
voices and tumult, and saw Orlick emerge from a struggle of men, as if
it were tumbling water, clear the table at a leap, and fly out into the
night.

<p/>After a blank, I found that I was lying unbound, on the floor, in the
same place, with my head on some one's knee. My eyes were fixed on the
ladder against the wall, when I came to myself,--had opened on it before
my mind saw it,--and thus as I recovered consciousness, I knew that I
was in the place where I had lost it.

<p/>Too indifferent at first, even to look round and ascertain who supported
me, I was lying looking at the ladder, when there came between me and it
a face. The face of Trabb's boy!

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think he (<font color='blue'><b>Magwitch</b></font>)'s all right!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Trabb/Trabb</b></font>)</div>said Trabb's boy, in a sober voice; <div class="bookquote">``but ain't
he (<font color='blue'><b>Magwitch</b></font>) just pale though!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Trabb boy</b></font>)</div><p/>At these words, the face of him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) who supported me looked over into mine,
and I saw my supporter to be--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Herbert! Great Heaven!''

 (<font color='red'><b>supporter</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Softly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Herbert/Herbert Pocket</b></font>)</div>said Herbert. <div class="bookquote">``Gently, Handel. Don't be too eager.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And our old comrade, Startop!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I cried, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) too bent over me.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Remember what he (<font color='blue'><b>comrade</b></font>) is going to assist us in,''  (<font color='red'><b>Herbert/Herbert Pocket</b></font>)</div>said Herbert, <div class="bookquote">``and be
calm.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Herbert/Herbert Pocket</b></font>)</div><p/>The allusion made me spring up; though I dropped again from the pain
in my arm. <div class="bookquote">``The time has not gone by, Herbert, has it? What night is
to-night? How long have I been here?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>For, I had a strange and
strong misgiving that I had been lying there a long time--a day and a
night,--two days and nights,--more.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The time has not gone by. It is still Monday night.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank God!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you have all to-morrow, Tuesday, to rest in,''  (<font color='red'><b>Herbert/Herbert Pocket</b></font>)</div>said Herbert. <div class="bookquote">``But
you can't help groaning, my dear Handel. What hurt have you got? Can you
stand?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, <div class="bookquote">``I can walk. I have no hurt but in this throbbing
arm.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>They laid it bare, and did what they could. It was violently swollen and
inflamed, and I could scarcely endure to have it touched. But, they tore
up their handkerchiefs to make fresh bandages, and carefully replaced
it in the sling, until we could get to the town and obtain some cooling
lotion to put upon it. In a little while we had shut the door of the
dark and empty sluice-house, and were passing through the quarry on our
way back. Trabb's boy--Trabb's overgrown young man now--went before us
with a lantern, which was the light I had seen come in at the door. But,
the moon was a good two hours higher than when I had last seen the sky,
and the night, though rainy, was much lighter. The white vapor of the
kiln was passing from us as we went by, and as I had thought a prayer
before, I thought a thanksgiving now.

<p/>Entreating Herbert to tell me how he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) had come to my rescue,--which at
first he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) had flatly refused to do, but had insisted on my remaining
quiet,--I learnt that I had in my hurry dropped the letter, open, in our
chambers, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>), coming home to bring with him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) Startop whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) had
met in the street on his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) way to me, found it, very soon after I
was gone. Its tone made him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) uneasy, and the more so because of the
inconsistency between it and the hasty letter I had left for him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>). His (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>)
uneasiness increasing instead of subsiding, after a quarter of an
hour's consideration, he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) set off for the coach-office with Startop, who
volunteered his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) company, to make inquiry when the next coach went
down. Finding that the afternoon coach was gone, and finding that his (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>)
uneasiness grew into positive alarm, as obstacles came in his (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) way, he (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>)
resolved to follow in a post-chaise. So he (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) and Startop arrived at the
Blue Boar, fully expecting there to find me, or tidings of me; but,
finding neither, went on to Miss Havisham's, where they lost me.
Hereupon they went back to the hotel -LRB-doubtless at about the time when
I was hearing the popular local version of my own story-RRB- to refresh
themselves and to get some one to guide them out upon the marshes. Among
the loungers under the Boar's archway happened to be Trabb's Boy,--true
to his (<font color='blue'><b>Trabb</b></font>) ancient habit of happening to be everywhere where he (<font color='blue'><b>Trabb</b></font>) had no
business,--and Trabb's boy had seen me passing from Miss Havisham's in
the direction of my dining-place. Thus Trabb's boy became their guide,
and with him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) they went out to the sluice-house, though by the town way
to the marshes, which I had avoided. Now, as they went along, Herbert
reflected, that I might, after all, have been brought there on some
genuine and serviceable errand tending to Provis's safety, and,
bethinking himself that in that case interruption must be mischievous,
left his (<font color='blue'><b>Provis</b></font>) guide and Startop on the edge of the quarry, and went on by
himself, and stole round the house two or three times, endeavouring to
ascertain whether all was right within. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Provis</b></font>) could hear nothing but
indistinct sounds of one deep rough voice -LRB-this was while my mind was so
busy-RRB-, he (<font color='blue'><b>Provis</b></font>) even at last began to doubt whether I was there, when suddenly
I cried out loudly, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Provis</b></font>) answered the cries, and rushed in, closely
followed by the other two.

<p/>When I told Herbert what had passed within the house, he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) was for our
immediately going before a magistrate in the town, late at night as it
was, and getting out a warrant. But, I had already considered that such
a course, by detaining us there, or binding us to come back, might
be fatal to Provis. There was no gainsaying this difficulty, and we
relinquished all thoughts of pursuing Orlick at that time. For the
present, under the circumstances, we deemed it prudent to make rather
light of the matter to Trabb's boy; who, I am convinced, would have been
much affected by disappointment, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Trabb</b></font>) had known that his (<font color='blue'><b>Trabb</b></font>) intervention
saved me from the limekiln. Not that Trabb's boy was of a malignant
nature, but that he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had too much spare vivacity, and that it was in his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
constitution to want variety and excitement at anybody's expense. When
we parted, I presented him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) with two guineas -LRB-which seemed to meet his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
views-RRB-, and told him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) that I was sorry ever to have had an ill opinion of
him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) -LRB-which made no impression on him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) at all-RRB-.

<p/>Wednesday being so close upon us, we determined to go back to London
that night, three in the post-chaise; the rather, as we should then be
clear away before the night's adventure began to be talked of. Herbert
got a large bottle of stuff for my arm; and by dint of having this stuff
dropped over it all the night through, I was just able to bear its pain
on the journey. It was daylight when we reached the Temple, and I went
at once to bed, and lay in bed all day.

<p/>My terror, as I lay there, of falling ill, and being unfitted for
to-morrow, was so besetting, that I wonder it did not disable me of
itself. It would have done so, pretty surely, in conjunction with the
mental wear and tear I had suffered, but for the unnatural strain upon
me that to-morrow was. So anxiously looked forward to, charged with such
consequences, its results so impenetrably hidden, though so near.

<p/>No precaution could have been more obvious than our refraining
from communication with him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) that day; yet this again increased my
restlessness. I started at every footstep and every sound, believing
that he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) was discovered and taken, and this was the messenger to tell
me so. I persuaded myself that I knew he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) was taken; that there was
something more upon my mind than a fear or a presentiment; that the fact
had occurred, and I had a mysterious knowledge of it. As the days wore
on, and no ill news came, as the day closed in and darkness fell,
my overshadowing dread of being disabled by illness before to-morrow
morning altogether mastered me. My burning arm throbbed, and my burning
head throbbed, and I fancied I was beginning to wander. I counted up to
high numbers, to make sure of myself, and repeated passages that I knew
in prose and verse. It happened sometimes that in the mere escape of a
fatigued mind, I dozed for some moments or forgot; then I would say to
myself with a start, <div class="bookquote">``Now it has come, and I am turning delirious!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>They kept me very quiet all day, and kept my arm constantly dressed, and
gave me cooling drinks. Whenever I fell asleep, I awoke with the notion
I had had in the sluice-house, that a long time had elapsed and the
opportunity to save him (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) was gone. About midnight I got out of bed
and went to Herbert, with the conviction that I had been asleep for
four-and-twenty hours, and that Wednesday was past. It was the last
self-exhausting effort of my fretfulness, for after that I slept
soundly.

<p/>Wednesday morning was dawning when I looked out of window. The winking
lights upon the bridges were already pale, the coming sun was like a
marsh of fire on the horizon. The river, still dark and mysterious, was
spanned by bridges that were turning coldly gray, with here and there
at top a warm touch from the burning in the sky. As I looked along
the clustered roofs, with church-towers and spires shooting into the
unusually clear air, the sun rose up, and a veil seemed to be drawn from
the river, and millions of sparkles burst out upon its waters. From me
too, a veil seemed to be drawn, and I felt strong and well.

<p/>Herbert lay asleep in his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) bed, and our old fellow-student lay asleep on
the sofa. I could not dress myself without help; but I made up the fire,
which was still burning, and got some coffee ready for them. In good
time they too started up strong and well, and we admitted the sharp
morning air at the windows, and looked at the tide that was still
flowing towards us.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``When it turns at nine o’clock,''  (<font color='red'><b>Herbert/Herbert Pocket</b></font>)</div>said Herbert, cheerfully, <div class="bookquote">``look out for
us, and stand ready, you over there at Mill Pond Bank!''




 (<font color='red'><b>Herbert/Herbert Pocket</b></font>)</div><p/>Chapter LIV

<p/>It was one of those March days when the sun shines hot and the wind
blows cold: when it is summer in the light, and winter in the shade.
We had our pea-coats with us, and I took a bag. Of all my worldly
possessions I took no more than the few necessaries that filled the
bag. Where I might go, what I might do, or when I might return, were
questions utterly unknown to me; nor did I vex my mind with them, for
it was wholly set on Provis's safety. I only wondered for the passing
moment, as I stopped at the door and looked back, under what altered
circumstances I should next see those rooms, if ever.

<p/>We loitered down to the Temple stairs, and stood loitering there, as if
we were not quite decided to go upon the water at all. Of course, I had
taken care that the boat should be ready and everything in order. After
a little show of indecision, which there were none to see but the two
or three amphibious creatures belonging to our Temple stairs, we went
on board and cast off; Herbert in the bow, I steering. It was then about
high-water,--half-past eight.

<p/>Our plan was this. The tide, beginning to run down at nine, and being
with us until three, we intended still to creep on after it had turned,
and row against it until dark. We should then be well in those long
reaches below Gravesend, between Kent and Essex, where the river is
broad and solitary, where the water-side inhabitants are very few, and
where lone public-houses are scattered here and there, of which we could
choose one for a resting-place. There, we meant to lie by all night.
The steamer for Hamburg and the steamer for Rotterdam would start from
London at about nine on Thursday morning. We should know at what time
to expect them, according to where we were, and would hail the first;
so that, if by any accident we were not taken abroad, we should have
another chance. We knew the distinguishing marks of each vessel.

<p/>The relief of being at last engaged in the execution of the purpose
was so great to me that I felt it difficult to realize the condition in
which I had been a few hours before. The crisp air, the sunlight, the
movement on the river, and the moving river itself,--the road that ran
with us, seeming to sympathize with us, animate us, and encourage us
on,--freshened me with new hope. I felt mortified to be of so little use
in the boat; but, there were few better oarsmen than my two friends, and
they rowed with a steady stroke that was to last all day.

<p/>At that time, the steam-traffic on the Thames was far below its present
extent, and watermen's boats were far more numerous. Of barges, sailing
colliers, and coasting-traders, there were perhaps, as many as now;
but of steam-ships, great and small, not a tithe or a twentieth part
so many. Early as it was, there were plenty of scullers going here and
there that morning, and plenty of barges dropping down with the tide;
the navigation of the river between bridges, in an open boat, was a much
easier and commoner matter in those days than it is in these; and we
went ahead among many skiffs and wherries briskly.

<p/>Old London Bridge was soon passed, and old Billingsgate Market with its
oyster-boats and Dutchmen, and the White Tower and Traitor's Gate, and
we were in among the tiers of shipping. Here were the Leith, Aberdeen,
and Glasgow steamers, loading and unloading goods, and looking immensely
high out of the water as we passed alongside; here, were colliers by the
score and score, with the coal-whippers plunging off stages on deck, as
counterweights to measures of coal swinging up, which were then rattled
over the side into barges; here, at her (<font color='blue'><b>Dutchmen</b></font>) moorings was to-morrow's steamer
for Rotterdam, of which we took good notice; and here to-morrow's for
Hamburg, under whose bowsprit we crossed. And now I, sitting in the
stern, could see, with a faster beating heart, Mill Pond Bank and Mill
Pond stairs.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is he (<font color='blue'><b>Handel</b></font>) there?''  (<font color='red'><b>Herbert/Herbert Pocket</b></font>)</div>said Herbert.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not yet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Right! He (<font color='blue'><b>Handel</b></font>) was not to come down till he (<font color='blue'><b>Handel</b></font>) saw us. Can you see his (<font color='blue'><b>Handel</b></font>) signal?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not well from here; but I think I see it.--Now I see him (<font color='blue'><b>Handel</b></font>)! Pull both.
Easy, Herbert. Oars!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>We touched the stairs lightly for a single moment, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) was on board,
and we were off again. He (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) had a boat-cloak with him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>), and a black canvas
bag; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) looked as like a river-pilot as my heart could have wished.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear boy!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) said, putting his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) arm on my shoulder, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>)
seat. <div class="bookquote">``Faithful dear boy, well done. Thankye, thankye!''

 (<font color='red'><b>scum</b></font>)</div><p/>Again among the tiers of shipping, in and out, avoiding rusty
chain-cables frayed hempen hawsers and bobbing buoys, sinking for the
moment floating broken baskets, scattering floating chips of wood
and shaving, cleaving floating scum of coal, in and out, under the
figure-head of the John of Sunderland making a speech to the winds -LRB-as
is done by many Johns-RRB-, and the Betsy of Yarmouth with a firm formality
of bosom and her (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>) knobby eyes starting two inches out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>) head; in
and out, hammers going in ship-builders' yards, saws going at timber,
clashing engines going at things unknown, pumps going in leaky ships,
capstans going, ships going out to sea, and unintelligible sea-creatures
roaring curses over the bulwarks at respondent lightermen, in and
out,--out at last upon the clearer river, where the ships' boys might
take their fenders in, no longer fishing in troubled waters with them
over the side, and where the festooned sails might fly out to the wind.

<p/>At the stairs where we had taken him (<font color='blue'><b>respondent</b></font>) abroad, and ever since, I had
looked warily for any token of our being suspected. I had seen none. We
certainly had not been, and at that time as certainly we were not either
attended or followed by any boat. If we had been waited on by any boat,
I should have run in to shore, and have obliged her (<font color='blue'><b>respondent</b></font>) to go on, or to
make her (<font color='blue'><b>respondent</b></font>) purpose evident. But we held our own without any appearance of
molestation.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>respondent</b></font>) had his (<font color='blue'><b>respondent</b></font>) boat-cloak on him (<font color='blue'><b>respondent</b></font>), and looked, as I have said, a natural part
of the scene. It was remarkable -LRB-but perhaps the wretched life he (<font color='blue'><b>respondent</b></font>) had
led accounted for it-RRB- that he (<font color='blue'><b>respondent</b></font>) was the least anxious of any of us. He (<font color='blue'><b>respondent</b></font>)
was not indifferent, for he (<font color='blue'><b>respondent</b></font>) told me that he (<font color='blue'><b>respondent</b></font>) hoped to live to see his (<font color='blue'><b>respondent</b></font>)
gentleman one of the best of gentlemen in a foreign country; he (<font color='blue'><b>respondent</b></font>) was not
disposed to be passive or resigned, as I understood it; but he (<font color='blue'><b>respondent</b></font>) had no
notion of meeting danger half way. When it came upon him (<font color='blue'><b>respondent</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>respondent</b></font>) confronted
it, but it must come before he (<font color='blue'><b>respondent</b></font>) troubled himself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you knowed, dear boy,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>respondent</b></font>) said to me, <div class="bookquote">``what it is to sit here
alonger my dear boy and have my smoke, arter having been day by day
betwixt four walls, you'd envy me. But you don't know what it is.''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think I know the delights of freedom,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I answered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>respondent</b></font>), shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>respondent</b></font>) head gravely. <div class="bookquote">``But you don't know it equal to
me. You must have been under lock and key, dear boy, to know it equal to
me,--but I ain't a going to be low.''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>It occurred to me as inconsistent, that, for any mastering idea, he (<font color='blue'><b>respondent</b></font>)
should have endangered his (<font color='blue'><b>respondent</b></font>) freedom, and even his (<font color='blue'><b>respondent</b></font>) life. But I reflected
that perhaps freedom without danger was too much apart from all the
habit of his (<font color='blue'><b>respondent</b></font>) existence to be to him (<font color='blue'><b>respondent</b></font>) what it would be to another man. I
was not far out, since he (<font color='blue'><b>respondent</b></font>) said, after smoking a little:--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You see, dear boy, when I was over yonder, t'other side the world, I
was always a looking to this side; and it come flat to be there, for
all I was a growing rich. Everybody knowed Magwitch, and Magwitch could
come, and Magwitch could go, and nobody's head would be troubled about
him (<font color='blue'><b>Magwitch</b></font>). They ain't so easy concerning me here, dear boy,--wouldn't be,
leastwise, if they knowed where I was.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If all goes well,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, <div class="bookquote">``you will be perfectly free and safe again
within a few hours.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>respondent</b></font>) returned, drawing a long breath, <div class="bookquote">``I hope so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And think so?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>respondent</b></font>) dipped his (<font color='blue'><b>respondent</b></font>) hand in the water over the boat's gunwale, and said,
smiling with that softened air upon him (<font color='blue'><b>respondent</b></font>) which was not new to me:--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, I s'pose I think so, dear boy. We'd be puzzled to be more quiet
and easy-going than we are at present. But--it's a flowing so soft
and pleasant through the water, p'raps, as makes me think it--I was
a thinking through my smoke just then, that we can no more see to the
bottom of the next few hours than we can see to the bottom of this river
what I catches hold of. Nor yet we can't no more hold their tide than
I can hold this. And it's run through my fingers and gone, you see!''
 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>holding up his (<font color='blue'><b>respondent</b></font>) dripping hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But for your face I should think you were a little despondent,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not a bit on it, dear boy! It comes of flowing on so quiet, and of that
there rippling at the boat's head making a sort of a Sunday tune. Maybe
I'm a growing a trifle old besides.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>respondent</b></font>) put his (<font color='blue'><b>respondent</b></font>) pipe back in his (<font color='blue'><b>respondent</b></font>) mouth with an undisturbed expression of
face, and sat as composed and contented as if we were already out of
England. Yet he (<font color='blue'><b>respondent</b></font>) was as submissive to a word of advice as if he (<font color='blue'><b>respondent</b></font>) had been
in constant terror; for, when we ran ashore to get some bottles of beer
into the boat, and he (<font color='blue'><b>respondent</b></font>) was stepping out, I hinted that I thought he (<font color='blue'><b>respondent</b></font>) would
be safest where he (<font color='blue'><b>respondent</b></font>) was, and he (<font color='blue'><b>respondent</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Do you, dear boy?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>and quietly sat
down again.

<p/>The air felt cold upon the river, but it was a bright day, and the
sunshine was very cheering. The tide ran strong, I took care to lose
none of it, and our steady stroke carried us on thoroughly well. By
imperceptible degrees, as the tide ran out, we lost more and more of the
nearer woods and hills, and dropped lower and lower between the muddy
banks, but the tide was yet with us when we were off Gravesend. As our
charge was wrapped in his (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>) cloak, I purposely passed within a boat or
two's length of the floating Custom House, and so out to catch the
stream, alongside of two emigrant ships, and under the bows of a large
transport with troops on the forecastle looking down at us. And soon
the tide began to slacken, and the craft lying at anchor to swing,
and presently they had all swung round, and the ships that were taking
advantage of the new tide to get up to the Pool began to crowd upon us
in a fleet, and we kept under the shore, as much out of the strength of
the tide now as we could, standing carefully off from low shallows and
mudbanks.

<p/>Our oarsmen were so fresh, by dint of having occasionally let her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) drive
with the tide for a minute or two, that a quarter of an hour's rest
proved full as much as they wanted. We got ashore among some slippery
stones while we ate and drank what we had with us, and looked about.
It was like my own marsh country, flat and monotonous, and with a
dim horizon; while the winding river turned and turned, and the great
floating buoys upon it turned and turned, and everything else seemed
stranded and still. For now the last of the fleet of ships was round
the last low point we had headed; and the last green barge, straw-laden,
with a brown sail, had followed; and some ballast-lighters, shaped like
a child's first rude imitation of a boat, lay low in the mud; and a
little squat shoal-lighthouse on open piles stood crippled in the mud
on stilts and crutches; and slimy stakes stuck out of the mud, and slimy
stones stuck out of the mud, and red landmarks and tidemarks stuck
out of the mud, and an old landing-stage and an old roofless building
slipped into the mud, and all about us was stagnation and mud.

<p/>We pushed off again, and made what way we could. It was much harder work
now, but Herbert and Startop persevered, and rowed and rowed and rowed
until the sun went down. By that time the river had lifted us a little,
so that we could see above the bank. There was the red sun, on the low
level of the shore, in a purple haze, fast deepening into black; and
there was the solitary flat marsh; and far away there were the rising
grounds, between which and us there seemed to be no life, save here and
there in the foreground a melancholy gull.

<p/>As the night was fast falling, and as the moon, being past the full,
would not rise early, we held a little council; a short one, for clearly
our course was to lie by at the first lonely tavern we could find. So,
they plied their oars once more, and I looked out for anything like a
house. Thus we held on, speaking little, for four or five dull miles. It
was very cold, and, a collier coming by us, with her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) galley-fire smoking
and flaring, looked like a comfortable home. The night was as dark by
this time as it would be until morning; and what light we had, seemed
to come more from the river than the sky, as the oars in their dipping
struck at a few reflected stars.

<p/>At this dismal time we were evidently all possessed by the idea that
we were followed. As the tide made, it flapped heavily at irregular
intervals against the shore; and whenever such a sound came, one or
other of us was sure to start, and look in that direction. Here and
there, the set of the current had worn down the bank into a little
creek, and we were all suspicious of such places, and eyed them
nervously. Sometimes, <div class="bookquote">``What was that ripple?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>one of us would say in a
low voice. Or another, <div class="bookquote">``Is that a boat yonder?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>And afterwards we would
fall into a dead silence, and I would sit impatiently thinking with what
an unusual amount of noise the oars worked in the thowels.

<p/>At length we descried a light and a roof, and presently afterwards ran
alongside a little causeway made of stones that had been picked up hard
by. Leaving the rest in the boat, I stepped ashore, and found the light
to be in a window of a public-house. It was a dirty place enough, and I
dare say not unknown to smuggling adventurers; but there was a good
fire in the kitchen, and there were eggs and bacon to eat, and various
liquors to drink. Also, there were two double-bedded rooms,--<div class="bookquote">``such as
they were,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>the landlord said. No other company was in the house than
the landlord, his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) wife, and a grizzled male creature, the <div class="bookquote">``Jack''  (<font color='red'><b>a male creature</b></font>)</div>of the
little causeway, who was as slimy and smeary as if he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) had been low-water
mark too.

<p/>With this assistant, I went down to the boat again, and we all came
ashore, and brought out the oars, and rudder and boat-hook, and all
else, and hauled her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) up for the night. We made a very good meal by the
kitchen fire, and then apportioned the bedrooms: Herbert and Startop
were to occupy one; I and our charge the other. We found the air as
carefully excluded from both, as if air were fatal to life; and there
were more dirty clothes and bandboxes under the beds than I should have
thought the family possessed. But we considered ourselves well off,
notwithstanding, for a more solitary place we could not have found.

<p/>While we were comforting ourselves by the fire after our meal, the
Jack--who was sitting in a corner, and who had a bloated pair of shoes
on, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) had exhibited while we were eating our eggs and bacon, as
interesting relics that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) had taken a few days ago from the feet of
a drowned seaman washed ashore--asked me if we had seen a four-oared
galley going up with the tide? When I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) No, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) said she (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) must have
gone down then, and yet she (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``took up too,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>when she (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) left there.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They must ha' thought better on't for some reason or another,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jack</b></font>)</div>said the
Jack, <div class="bookquote">``and gone down.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jack</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A four-oared galley, did you say?''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A four,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said the Jack, <div class="bookquote">``and two sitters.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jack</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did they come ashore here?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They put in with a stone two-gallon jar for some beer. I'd ha' been
glad to pison the beer myself,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jack</b></font>)</div>said the Jack, <div class="bookquote">``or put some rattling
physic in it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jack</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know why,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jack</b></font>)</div>said the Jack. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) spoke in a slushy voice, as if much mud
had washed into his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) throat.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) thinks,''  (<font color='red'><b>a man</b></font>)</div>said the landlord, a weakly meditative man with a pale eye,
who seemed to rely greatly on his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) Jack,--<div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) thinks they was, what they
wasn't.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jack</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I knows what I thinks,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jack</b></font>)</div>observed the Jack.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You thinks Custum `Us, Jack?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the landlord.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I do,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jack</b></font>)</div>said the Jack.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then you're wrong, Jack.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``AM I!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jack</b></font>)</div><p/>In the infinite meaning of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) reply and his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) boundless confidence in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) views, the Jack took one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) bloated shoes off, looked into
it, knocked a few stones out of it on the kitchen floor, and put it on
again. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) did this with the air of a Jack who was so right that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) could
afford to do anything.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, what do you make out that they done with their buttons then,
Jack?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>asked the landlord, vacillating weakly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Done with their buttons?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jack</b></font>)</div>returned the Jack. <div class="bookquote">``Chucked `em overboard.
Swallered `em. Sowed `em, to come up small salad. Done with their
buttons!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't be cheeky, Jack,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>remonstrated the landlord, in a melancholy and
pathetic way.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A Custum `Us officer knows what to do with his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) Buttons,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jack</b></font>)</div>said the Jack,
repeating the obnoxious word with the greatest contempt, <div class="bookquote">``when they
comes betwixt him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) own light. A four and two sitters don't go
hanging and hovering, up with one tide and down with another, and both
with and against another, without there being Custum `Us at the bottom
of it.''  (<font color='red'><b>Jack</b></font>)</div>Saying which he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) went out in disdain; and the landlord, having no
one to reply upon, found it impracticable to pursue the subject.

<p/>This dialogue made us all uneasy, and me very uneasy. The dismal wind
was muttering round the house, the tide was flapping at the shore, and
I had a feeling that we were caged and threatened. A four-oared galley
hovering about in so unusual a way as to attract this notice was an ugly
circumstance that I could not get rid of. When I had induced Provis to
go up to bed, I went outside with my two companions -LRB-Startop by this
time knew the state of the case-RRB-, and held another council. Whether we
should remain at the house until near the steamer's time, which would
be about one in the afternoon, or whether we should put off early in the
morning, was the question we discussed. On the whole we deemed it the
better course to lie where we were, until within an hour or so of the
steamer's time, and then to get out in her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) track, and drift easily with
the tide. Having settled to do this, we returned into the house and went
to bed.

<p/>I lay down with the greater part of my clothes on, and slept well for a
few hours. When I awoke, the wind had risen, and the sign of the house
-LRB-the Ship-RRB- was creaking and banging about, with noises that startled
me. Rising softly, for my charge lay fast asleep, I looked out of the
window. It commanded the causeway where we had hauled up our boat, and,
as my eyes adapted themselves to the light of the clouded moon, I saw
two men looking into her (<font color='blue'><b>themselves</b></font>). They passed by under the window, looking at
nothing else, and they did not go down to the landing-place which I
could discern to be empty, but struck across the marsh in the direction
of the Nore.

<p/>My first impulse was to call up Herbert, and show him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) the two men going
away. But reflecting, before I got into his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) room, which was at the back
of the house and adjoined mine, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) and Startop had had a harder day
than I, and were fatigued, I forbore. Going back to my window, I could
see the two men moving over the marsh. In that light, however, I soon
lost them, and, feeling very cold, lay down to think of the matter, and
fell asleep again.

<p/>We were up early. As we walked to and fro, all four together, before
breakfast, I deemed it right to recount what I had seen. Again our
charge was the least anxious of the party. It was very likely that the
men belonged to the Custom House, he (<font color='blue'><b>party</b></font>) said quietly, and that they had no
thought of us. I tried to persuade myself that it was so,--as, indeed,
it might easily be. However, I proposed that he (<font color='blue'><b>party</b></font>) and I should walk away
together to a distant point we could see, and that the boat should take
us aboard there, or as near there as might prove feasible, at about
noon. This being considered a good precaution, soon after breakfast he (<font color='blue'><b>party</b></font>)
and I set forth, without saying anything at the tavern.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>party</b></font>) smoked his (<font color='blue'><b>party</b></font>) pipe as we went along, and sometimes stopped to clap me on
the shoulder. One would have supposed that it was I who was in danger,
not he (<font color='blue'><b>party</b></font>), and that he (<font color='blue'><b>party</b></font>) was reassuring me. We spoke very little. As we
approached the point, I begged him (<font color='blue'><b>party</b></font>) to remain in a sheltered place, while
I went on to reconnoitre; for it was towards it that the men had passed
in the night. He (<font color='blue'><b>party</b></font>) complied, and I went on alone. There was no boat off
the point, nor any boat drawn up anywhere near it, nor were there any
signs of the men having embarked there. But, to be sure, the tide was
high, and there might have been some footpints under water.

<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>party</b></font>) looked out from his (<font color='blue'><b>party</b></font>) shelter in the distance, and saw that I
waved my hat to him (<font color='blue'><b>party</b></font>) to come up, he (<font color='blue'><b>party</b></font>) rejoined me, and there we waited;
sometimes lying on the bank, wrapped in our coats, and sometimes moving
about to warm ourselves, until we saw our boat coming round. We got
aboard easily, and rowed out into the track of the steamer. By that time
it wanted but ten minutes of one o’clock, and we began to look out for
her (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) smoke.

<p/>But, it was half-past one before we saw her (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) smoke, and soon afterwards
we saw behind it the smoke of another steamer. As they were coming on
at full speed, we got the two bags ready, and took that opportunity
of saying good-bye to Herbert and Startop. We had all shaken hands
cordially, and neither Herbert's eyes nor mine were quite dry, when I
saw a four-oared galley shoot out from under the bank but a little way
ahead of us, and row out into the same track.

<p/>A stretch of shore had been as yet between us and the steamer's smoke,
by reason of the bend and wind of the river; but now she (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) was visible,
coming head on. I called to Herbert and Startop to keep before the tide,
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) might see us lying by for her (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>), and I adjured Provis to sit
quite still, wrapped in his (<font color='blue'><b>Provis</b></font>) cloak. He (<font color='blue'><b>Provis</b></font>) answered cheerily, <div class="bookquote">``Trust to me,
dear boy,''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>and sat like a statue. Meantime the galley, which was very
skilfully handled, had crossed us, let us come up with her (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>), and fallen
alongside. Leaving just room enough for the play of the oars, she (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) kept
alongside, drifting when we drifted, and pulling a stroke or two when we
pulled. Of the two sitters one held the rudder-lines, and looked at us
attentively,--as did all the rowers; the other sitter was wrapped up,
much as Provis was, and seemed to shrink, and whisper some instruction
to the steerer as he (<font color='blue'><b>Provis</b></font>) looked at us. Not a word was spoken in either boat.

<p/>Startop could make out, after a few minutes, which steamer was first,
and gave me the word <div class="bookquote">``Hamburg,''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>in a low voice, as we sat face to face.
She (<font color='blue'><b>sitter</b></font>) was nearing us very fast, and the beating of her (<font color='blue'><b>sitter</b></font>) peddles grew louder
and louder. I felt as if her (<font color='blue'><b>sitter</b></font>) shadow were absolutely upon us, when the
galley hailed us. I answered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You have a returned Transport there,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the man who held the lines.
<div class="bookquote">``That's the man, wrapped in the cloak. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) name is Abel Magwitch,
otherwise Provis. I apprehend that man, and call upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Provis</b></font>) to surrender,
and you to assist.''

 (<font color='red'><b>crew</b></font>)</div><p/>At the same moment, without giving any audible direction to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) crew,
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ran the galley abroad of us. They had pulled one sudden stroke ahead,
had got their oars in, had run athwart us, and were holding on to
our gunwale, before we knew what they were doing. This caused great
confusion on board the steamer, and I heard them calling to us, and
heard the order given to stop the paddles, and heard them stop, but felt
her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) driving down upon us irresistibly. In the same moment, I saw the
steersman of the galley lay his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) prisoner's shoulder, and saw
that both boats were swinging round with the force of the tide, and
saw that all hands on board the steamer were running forward quite
frantically. Still, in the same moment, I saw the prisoner start
up, lean across his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) captor, and pull the cloak from the neck of the
shrinking sitter in the galley. Still in the same moment, I saw that the
face disclosed, was the face of the other convict of long ago. Still, in
the same moment, I saw the face tilt backward with a white terror on it
that I shall never forget, and heard a great cry on board the steamer,
and a loud splash in the water, and felt the boat sink from under me.

<p/>It was but for an instant that I seemed to struggle with a thousand
mill-weirs and a thousand flashes of light; that instant past, I was
taken on board the galley. Herbert was there, and Startop was there; but
our boat was gone, and the two convicts were gone.

<p/>What with the cries aboard the steamer, and the furious blowing off of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) steam, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) driving on, and our driving on, I could not at first
distinguish sky from water or shore from shore; but the crew of the
galley righted her (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) with great speed, and, pulling certain swift strong
strokes ahead, lay upon their oars, every man looking silently and
eagerly at the water astern. Presently a dark object was seen in it,
bearing towards us on the tide. No man spoke, but the steersman held up
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand, and all softly backed water, and kept the boat straight and
true before it. As it came nearer, I saw it to be Magwitch, swimming,
but not swimming freely. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was taken on board, and instantly manacled
at the wrists and ankles.

<p/>The galley was kept steady, and the silent, eager look-out at the water
was resumed. But, the Rotterdam steamer now came up, and apparently not
understanding what had happened, came on at speed. By the time she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) had
been hailed and stopped, both steamers were drifting away from us, and
we were rising and falling in a troubled wake of water. The look-out was
kept, long after all was still again and the two steamers were gone; but
everybody knew that it was hopeless now.

<p/>At length we gave it up, and pulled under the shore towards the tavern
we had lately left, where we were received with no little surprise. Here
I was able to get some comforts for Magwitch,--Provis no longer,--who
had received some very severe injury in the Chest, and a deep cut in the
head.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Provis</b></font>) told me that he (<font color='blue'><b>Provis</b></font>) believed himself to have gone under the keel of the
steamer, and to have been struck on the head in rising. The injury to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Provis</b></font>) chest -LRB-which rendered his (<font color='blue'><b>Provis</b></font>) breathing extremely painful-RRB- he (<font color='blue'><b>Provis</b></font>) thought
he (<font color='blue'><b>Provis</b></font>) had received against the side of the galley. He (<font color='blue'><b>Provis</b></font>) added that he (<font color='blue'><b>Provis</b></font>) did not
pretend to say what he (<font color='blue'><b>Provis</b></font>) might or might not have done to Compeyson, but
that, in the moment of his (<font color='blue'><b>Provis</b></font>) laying his (<font color='blue'><b>Provis</b></font>) hand on his (<font color='blue'><b>Provis</b></font>) cloak to identify him (<font color='blue'><b>Provis</b></font>),
that villain had staggered up and staggered back, and they had both gone
overboard together, when the sudden wrenching of him (<font color='blue'><b>villain</b></font>) -LRB-Magwitch-RRB- out of
our boat, and the endeavor of his (<font color='blue'><b>Magwitch</b></font>) captor to keep him (<font color='blue'><b>Magwitch</b></font>) in it, had capsized
us. He (<font color='blue'><b>Magwitch</b></font>) told me in a whisper that they had gone down fiercely locked in
each other's arms, and that there had been a struggle under water, and
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Magwitch</b></font>) had disengaged himself, struck out, and swum away.

<p/>I never had any reason to doubt the exact truth of what he (<font color='blue'><b>Magwitch</b></font>) thus told me.
The officer who steered the galley gave the same account of their going
overboard.

<p/>When I asked this officer's permission to change the prisoner's
wet clothes by purchasing any spare garments I could get at the
public-house, he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) gave it readily: merely observing that he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) must take
charge of everything his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) prisoner had about him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>). So the pocket-book
which had once been in my hands passed into the officer's. He (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) further
gave me leave to accompany the prisoner to London; but declined to
accord that grace to my two friends.

<p/>The Jack at the Ship was instructed where the drowned man had gone
down, and undertook to search for the body in the places where it was
likeliest to come ashore. His (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) interest in its recovery seemed to me to
be much heightened when he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) heard that it had stockings on. Probably, it
took about a dozen drowned men to fit him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) out completely; and that may
have been the reason why the different articles of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) dress were in
various stages of decay.

<p/>We remained at the public-house until the tide turned, and then Magwitch
was carried down to the galley and put on board. Herbert and Startop
were to get to London by land, as soon as they could. We had a doleful
parting, and when I took my place by Magwitch's side, I felt that that
was my place henceforth while he (<font color='blue'><b>Magwitch</b></font>) lived.

<p/>For now, my repugnance to him (<font color='blue'><b>Magwitch</b></font>) had all melted away; and in the hunted,
wounded, shackled creature who held my hand in his (<font color='blue'><b>Magwitch</b></font>), I only saw a man
who had meant to be my benefactor, and who had felt affectionately,
gratefully, and generously, towards me with great constancy through a
series of years. I only saw in him (<font color='blue'><b>Magwitch</b></font>) a much better man than I had been to
Joe.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Magwitch</b></font>) breathing became more difficult and painful as the night drew on,
and often he (<font color='blue'><b>Magwitch</b></font>) could not repress a groan. I tried to rest him (<font color='blue'><b>Magwitch</b></font>) on the arm
I could use, in any easy position; but it was dreadful to think that
I could not be sorry at heart for his (<font color='blue'><b>Magwitch</b></font>) being badly hurt, since it was
unquestionably best that he (<font color='blue'><b>Magwitch</b></font>) should die. That there were, still living,
people enough who were able and willing to identify him (<font color='blue'><b>Magwitch</b></font>), I could not
doubt. That he (<font color='blue'><b>Magwitch</b></font>) would be leniently treated, I could not hope. He (<font color='blue'><b>Magwitch</b></font>) who had
been presented in the worst light at his (<font color='blue'><b>Magwitch</b></font>) trial, who had since broken
prison and had been tried again, who had returned from transportation
under a life sentence, and who had occasioned the death of the man who
was the cause of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) arrest.

<p/>As we returned towards the setting sun we had yesterday left behind us,
and as the stream of our hopes seemed all running back, I told him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) how
grieved I was to think that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had come home for my sake.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear boy,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) answered, <div class="bookquote">``I'm quite content to take my chance. I've seen
my boy, and he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) can be a gentleman without me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>No. I had thought about that, while we had been there side by side. No.
Apart from any inclinations of my own, I understood Wemmick's hint now.
I foresaw that, being convicted, his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) possessions would be forfeited to
the Crown.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Lookee here, dear boy,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``It's best as a gentleman should not be
knowed to belong to me now. Only come to see me as if you come by chance
alonger Wemmick. Sit where I can see you when I am swore to, for the
last o' many times, and I don't ask no more.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will never stir from your side,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, <div class="bookquote">``when I am suffered to be
near you. Please God, I will be as true to you as you have been to me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I felt his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) hand tremble as it held mine, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) face away
as he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) lay in the bottom of the boat, and I heard that old sound in his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>)
throat,--softened now, like all the rest of him (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>). It was a good thing
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) had touched this point, for it put into my mind what I might not
otherwise have thought of until too late,--that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) need never know how
his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) hopes of enriching me had perished.




<p/>Chapter LV

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) was taken to the Police Court next day, and would have been
immediately committed for trial, but that it was necessary to send down
for an old officer of the prison-ship from which he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) had once escaped, to
speak to his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) identity. Nobody doubted it; but Compeyson, who had meant
to depose to it, was tumbling on the tides, dead, and it happened that
there was not at that time any prison officer in London who could give
the required evidence. I had gone direct to Mr. Jaggers at his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) private
house, on my arrival over night, to retain his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) assistance, and Mr.
Jaggers on the prisoner's behalf would admit nothing. It was the sole
resource; for he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) told me that the case must be over in five minutes
when the witness was there, and that no power on earth could prevent its
going against us.

<p/>I imparted to Mr. Jaggers my design of keeping him (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) in ignorance of the
fate of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) wealth. Mr. Jaggers was querulous and angry with me for
having <div class="bookquote">``let it slip through my fingers,''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>and said we must memorialize
by and by, and try at all events for some of it. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) did not conceal
from me that, although there might be many cases in which the forfeiture
would not be exacted, there were no circumstances in this case to make
it one of them. I understood that very well. I was not related to the
outlaw, or connected with him (<font color='blue'><b>outlaw</b></font>) by any recognizable tie; he (<font color='blue'><b>outlaw</b></font>) had put his (<font color='blue'><b>outlaw</b></font>)
hand to no writing or settlement in my favor before his (<font color='blue'><b>outlaw</b></font>) apprehension,
and to do so now would be idle. I had no claim, and I finally resolved,
and ever afterwards abided by the resolution, that my heart should never
be sickened with the hopeless task of attempting to establish one.

<p/>There appeared to be reason for supposing that the drowned informer
had hoped for a reward out of this forfeiture, and had obtained some
accurate knowledge of Magwitch's affairs. When his (<font color='blue'><b>Magwitch</b></font>) body was found, many
miles from the scene of his (<font color='blue'><b>Magwitch</b></font>) death, and so horribly disfigured that he (<font color='blue'><b>Magwitch</b></font>)
was only recognizable by the contents of his (<font color='blue'><b>Magwitch</b></font>) pockets, notes were still
legible, folded in a case he (<font color='blue'><b>Magwitch</b></font>) carried. Among these were the name of a
banking-house in New South Wales, where a sum of money was, and the
designation of certain lands of considerable value. Both these heads of
information were in a list that Magwitch, while in prison, gave to Mr.
Jaggers, of the possessions he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) supposed I should inherit. His (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) ignorance,
poor fellow, at last served him (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) never mistrusted but that my
inheritance was quite safe, with Mr. Jaggers's aid.

<p/>After three days' delay, during which the crown prosecution stood over
for the production of the witness from the prison-ship, the witness
came, and completed the easy case. He (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) was committed to take his (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) trial at
the next Sessions, which would come on in a month.

<p/>It was at this dark time of my life that Herbert returned home one
evening, a good deal cast down, and said,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear Handel, I fear I shall soon have to leave you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Herbert/Herbert Pocket</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) partner having prepared me for that, I was less surprised than he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>)
thought.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We shall lose a fine opportunity if I put off going to Cairo, and I am
very much afraid I must go, Handel, when you most need me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Herbert, I shall always need you, because I shall always love you; but
my need is no greater now than at another time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You will be so lonely.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have not leisure to think of that,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I. <div class="bookquote">``You know that I am
always with him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) to the full extent of the time allowed, and that I
should be with him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) all day long, if I could. And when I come away from
him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>), you know that my thoughts are with him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div><p/>The dreadful condition to which he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) was brought, was so appalling to both
of us, that we could not refer to it in plainer words.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear fellow,''  (<font color='red'><b>Herbert/Herbert Pocket</b></font>)</div>said Herbert, <div class="bookquote">``let the near prospect of our
separation--for, it is very near--be my justification for troubling you
about yourself. Have you thought of your future?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Herbert/Herbert Pocket</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, for I have been afraid to think of any future.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But yours cannot be dismissed; indeed, my dear dear Handel, it must not
be dismissed. I wish you would enter on it now, as far as a few friendly
words go, with me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``In this branch house of ours, Handel, we must have a--''

 (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div><p/>I saw that his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) delicacy was avoiding the right word, so I said, <div class="bookquote">``A
clerk.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A clerk. And I hope it is not at all unlikely that he (<font color='blue'><b>Handel</b></font>) may expand -LRB-as
a clerk of your acquaintance has expanded-RRB- into a partner. Now,
Handel,--in short, my dear boy, will you come to me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>There was something charmingly cordial and engaging in the manner in
which after saying <div class="bookquote">``Now, Handel,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>as if it were the grave beginning of
a portentous business exordium, he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) had suddenly given up that tone,
stretched out his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) honest hand, and spoken like a schoolboy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Clara and I have talked about it again and again,''  (<font color='red'><b>Herbert/Herbert Pocket</b></font>)</div>Herbert pursued,
<div class="bookquote">``and the dear little thing begged me only this evening, with tears in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) eyes, to say to you that, if you will live with us when we come
together, she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) will do her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) best to make you happy, and to convince her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>)
husband's friend that he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) is her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) friend too. We should get on so well,
Handel!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Herbert/Herbert Pocket</b></font>)</div><p/>I thanked her (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) heartily, and I thanked him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) heartily, but said I could not
yet make sure of joining him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) so kindly offered. Firstly, my
mind was too preoccupied to be able to take in the subject clearly.
Secondly,--Yes! Secondly, there was a vague something lingering in my
thoughts that will come out very near the end of this slight narrative.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But if you thought, Herbert, that you could, without doing any injury
to your business, leave the question open for a little while--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Herbert/Herbert Pocket</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``For any while,''  (<font color='red'><b>Herbert/Herbert Pocket</b></font>)</div>cried Herbert. <div class="bookquote">``Six months, a year!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not so long as that,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I. <div class="bookquote">``Two or three months at most.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div><p/>Herbert was highly delighted when we shook hands on this arrangement,
and said he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) could now take courage to tell me that he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) believed he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) must
go away at the end of the week.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And Clara?''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The dear little thing,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>returned Herbert, <div class="bookquote">``holds dutifully to her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>)
father as long as he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) lasts; but he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) won't last long. Mrs. Whimple
confides to me that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) is certainly going.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Herbert/Herbert Pocket</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not to say an unfeeling thing,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) cannot do better than go.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am afraid that must be admitted,''  (<font color='red'><b>Herbert/Herbert Pocket</b></font>)</div>said Herbert; <div class="bookquote">``and then I shall
come back for the dear little thing, and the dear little thing and I
will walk quietly into the nearest church. Remember! The blessed darling
comes of no family, my dear Handel, and never looked into the red book,
and hasn't a notion about her (<font color='blue'><b>Whimple</b></font>) grandpapa. What a fortune for the son of
my mother!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Herbert/Herbert Pocket</b></font>)</div><p/>On the Saturday in that same week, I took my leave of Herbert,--full
of bright hope, but sad and sorry to leave me,--as he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) sat on one of the
seaport mail coaches. I went into a coffee-house to write a little note
to Clara, telling her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) had gone off, sending his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) love to her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) over and
over again, and then went to my lonely home,--if it deserved the name;
for it was now no home to me, and I had no home anywhere.

<p/>On the stairs I encountered Wemmick, who was coming down, after an
unsuccessful application of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) knuckles to my door. I had not seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>)
alone since the disastrous issue of the attempted flight; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) had
come, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) private and personal capacity, to say a few words of
explanation in reference to that failure.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The late Compeyson,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div>said Wemmick, <div class="bookquote">``had by little and little got at the
bottom of half of the regular business now transacted; and it was from
the talk of some of his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) people in trouble -LRB-some of his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) people being
always in trouble-RRB- that I heard what I did. I kept my ears open, seeming
to have them shut, until I heard that he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) was absent, and I thought that
would be the best time for making the attempt. I can only suppose now,
that it was a part of his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) policy, as a very clever man, habitually to
deceive his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) own instruments. You don't blame me, I hope, Mr. Pip? I am
sure I tried to serve you, with all my heart.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am as sure of that, Wemmick, as you can be, and I thank you most
earnestly for all your interest and friendship.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you, thank you very much. It's a bad job,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div>said Wemmick,
scratching his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) head, <div class="bookquote">``and I assure you I haven't been so cut up for a
long time. What I look at is the sacrifice of so much portable property.
Dear me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What I think of, Wemmick, is the poor owner of the property.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, to be sure,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div>said Wemmick. <div class="bookquote">``Of course, there can be no objection
to your being sorry for him (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>), and I'd put down a five-pound note myself
to get him (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) out of it. But what I look at is this. The late Compeyson
having been beforehand with him (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) in intelligence of his (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) return, and being
so determined to bring him (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) to book, I do not think he (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) could have been
saved. Whereas, the portable property certainly could have been saved.
That's the difference between the property and the owner, don't you
see?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I invited Wemmick to come upstairs, and refresh himself with a glass
of grog before walking to Walworth. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) accepted the invitation. While he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>)
was drinking his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) moderate allowance, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) said, with nothing to lead up to
it, and after having appeared rather fidgety,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you think of my meaning to take a holiday on Monday, Mr. Pip?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, I suppose you have not done such a thing these twelve months.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``These twelve years, more likely,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div>said Wemmick. <div class="bookquote">``Yes. I'm going to take
a holiday. More than that; I'm going to take a walk. More than that; I'm
going to ask you to take a walk with me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I was about to excuse myself, as being but a bad companion just then,
when Wemmick anticipated me.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I know your engagements,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``and I know you are out of sorts,
Mr. Pip. But if you could oblige me, I should take it as a kindness.
It ain't a long walk, and it's an early one. Say it might occupy you
-LRB-including breakfast on the walk-RRB- from eight to twelve. Couldn't you
stretch a point and manage it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) had done so much for me at various times, that this was very little
to do for him (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>). I said I could manage it,--would manage it,--and he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) was
so very much pleased by my acquiescence, that I was pleased too. At his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>)
particular request, I appointed to call for him (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) at the Castle at half
past eight on Monday morning, and so we parted for the time.

<p/>Punctual to my appointment, I rang at the Castle gate on the Monday
morning, and was received by Wemmick himself, who struck me as looking
tighter than usual, and having a sleeker hat on. Within, there were two
glasses of rum and milk prepared, and two biscuits. The Aged must have
been stirring with the lark, for, glancing into the perspective of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>)
bedroom, I observed that his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) bed was empty.

<p/>When we had fortified ourselves with the rum and milk and biscuits, and
were going out for the walk with that training preparation on us, I was
considerably surprised to see Wemmick take up a fishing-rod, and put
it over his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) shoulder. <div class="bookquote">``Why, we are not going fishing!''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I. <div class="bookquote">``No,''
 (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>returned Wemmick, <div class="bookquote">``but I like to walk with one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div><p/>I thought this odd; however, I said nothing, and we set off. We went
towards Camberwell Green, and when we were thereabouts, Wemmick said
suddenly,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Halloa! Here's a church!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div><p/>There was nothing very surprising in that; but again, I was rather
surprised, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) said, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) were animated by a brilliant idea,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let's go in!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>We went in, Wemmick leaving his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) fishing-rod in the porch, and looked all
round. In the mean time, Wemmick was diving into his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) coat-pockets, and
getting something out of paper there.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Halloa!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Here's a couple of pair of gloves! Let's put `em
on!''

 (<font color='red'><b>kid</b></font>)</div><p/>As the gloves were white kid gloves, and as the post-office was widened
to its utmost extent, I now began to have my strong suspicions. They
were strengthened into certainty when I beheld the Aged enter at a side
door, escorting a lady.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Halloa!''  (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div>said Wemmick. <div class="bookquote">``Here's Miss Skiffins! Let's have a wedding.''

 (<font color='red'><b>That damsel</b></font>)</div><p/>That discreet damsel was attired as usual, except that she (<font color='blue'><b>damsel</b></font>) was now
engaged in substituting for her (<font color='blue'><b>damsel</b></font>) green kid gloves a pair of white. The
Aged was likewise occupied in preparing a similar sacrifice for
the altar of Hymen. The old gentleman, however, experienced so much
difficulty in getting his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) gloves on, that Wemmick found it necessary
to put him (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) back against a pillar, and then to get behind the
pillar himself and pull away at them, while I for my part held the old
gentleman round the waist, that he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) might present an equal and safe
resistance. By dint of this ingenious scheme, his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) gloves were got on to
perfection.

<p/>The clerk and clergyman then appearing, we were ranged in order at
those fatal rails. True to his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) notion of seeming to do it all without
preparation, I heard Wemmick say to himself, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) took something out of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) waistcoat-pocket before the service began, <div class="bookquote">``Halloa! Here's a ring!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>I acted in the capacity of backer, or best-man, to the bridegroom; while
a little limp pew-opener in a soft bonnet like a baby's, made a feint
of being the bosom friend of Miss Skiffins. The responsibility of giving
the lady away devolved upon the Aged, which led to the clergyman's being
unintentionally scandalized, and it happened thus. When he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Who
giveth this woman to be married to this man?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>the old gentleman, not in
the least knowing what point of the ceremony we had arrived at, stood
most amiably beaming at the ten commandments. Upon which, the clergyman
said again, <div class="bookquote">``WHO giveth this woman to be married to this man?''  (<font color='red'><b>the clergyman</b></font>)</div>The old
gentleman being still in a state of most estimable unconsciousness, the
bridegroom cried out in his (<font color='blue'><b>bridegroom</b></font>) accustomed voice, <div class="bookquote">``Now Aged P. you know; who
giveth?''  (<font color='red'><b>the bridegroom</b></font>)</div>To which the Aged replied with great briskness, before saying
that he (<font color='blue'><b>bridegroom</b></font>) gave, <div class="bookquote">``All right, John, all right, my boy!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And the clergyman
came to so gloomy a pause upon it, that I had doubts for the moment
whether we should get completely married that day.

<p/>It was completely done, however, and when we were going out of church
Wemmick took the cover off the font, and put his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) white gloves in it, and
put the cover on again. Mrs. Wemmick, more heedful of the future, put
her (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) white gloves in her (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) pocket and assumed her (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) green. <div class="bookquote">``Now, Mr. Pip,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div>said Wemmick, triumphantly shouldering the fishing-rod as we came
out, <div class="bookquote">``let me ask you whether anybody would suppose this to be a
wedding-party!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div><p/>Breakfast had been ordered at a pleasant little tavern, a mile or so
away upon the rising ground beyond the green; and there was a bagatelle
board in the room, in case we should desire to unbend our minds after
the solemnity. It was pleasant to observe that Mrs. Wemmick no longer
unwound Wemmick's arm when it adapted itself to her (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) figure, but sat in a
high-backed chair against the wall, like a violoncello in its case, and
submitted to be embraced as that melodious instrument might have done.

<p/>We had an excellent breakfast, and when any one declined anything on
table, Wemmick said, <div class="bookquote">``Provided by contract, you know; don't be afraid of
it!''  (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div>I drank to the new couple, drank to the Aged, drank to the Castle,
saluted the bride at parting, and made myself as agreeable as I could.

<p/>Wemmick came down to the door with me, and I again shook hands with him (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>),
and wished him (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) joy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thankee!''  (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div>said Wemmick, rubbing his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) hands. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'s such a manager
of fowls, you have no idea. You shall have some eggs, and judge for
yourself. I say, Mr. Pip!''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>calling me back, and speaking low. <div class="bookquote">``This is
altogether a Walworth sentiment, please.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I understand. Not to be mentioned in Little Britain,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I.

<p/>Wemmick nodded. <div class="bookquote">``After what you let out the other day, Mr. Jaggers
may as well not know of it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) might think my brain was softening, or
something of the kind.''




 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>Chapter LVI

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) lay in prison very ill, during the whole interval between his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>)
committal for trial and the coming round of the Sessions. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) had broken
two ribs, they had wounded one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) lungs, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) breathed with great
pain and difficulty, which increased daily. It was a consequence of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>)
hurt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) spoke so low as to be scarcely audible; therefore he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) spoke
very little. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) was ever ready to listen to me; and it became the
first duty of my life to say to him (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>), and read to him (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>), what I knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>)
ought to hear.

<p/>Being far too ill to remain in the common prison, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) was removed, after
the first day or so, into the infirmary. This gave me opportunities
of being with him (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) that I could not otherwise have had. And but for
his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) illness he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) would have been put in irons, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) was regarded as a
determined prison-breaker, and I know not what else.

<p/>Although I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) every day, it was for only a short time; hence, the
regularly recurring spaces of our separation were long enough to record
on his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) face any slight changes that occurred in his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) physical state. I
do not recollect that I once saw any change in it for the better; he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>)
wasted, and became slowly weaker and worse, day by day, from the day
when the prison door closed upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>).

<p/>The kind of submission or resignation that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) showed was that of a man
who was tired out. I sometimes derived an impression, from his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) manner
or from a whispered word or two which escaped him (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>), that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) pondered
over the question whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) might have been a better man under better
circumstances. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) never justified himself by a hint tending that
way, or tried to bend the past out of its eternal shape.

<p/>It happened on two or three occasions in my presence, that his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) desperate
reputation was alluded to by one or other of the people in attendance on
him (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>). A smile crossed his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) face then, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) eyes on me with
a trustful look, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) were confident that I had seen some small
redeeming touch in him (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>), even so long ago as when I was a little child.
As to all the rest, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) was humble and contrite, and I never knew him (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>)
complain.

<p/>When the Sessions came round, Mr. Jaggers caused an application to be
made for the postponement of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) trial until the following Sessions. It
was obviously made with the assurance that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) could not live so long,
and was refused. The trial came on at once, and, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) was put to the
bar, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) was seated in a chair. No objection was made to my getting
close to the dock, on the outside of it, and holding the hand that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>)
stretched forth to me.

<p/>The trial was very short and very clear. Such things as could be said
for him (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) were said,--how he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) had taken to industrious habits, and had
thriven lawfully and reputably. But nothing could unsay the fact that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) had returned, and was there in presence of the Judge and Jury. It was
impossible to try him (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) for that, and do otherwise than find him (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) guilty.

<p/>At that time, it was the custom -LRB-as I learnt from my terrible experience
of that Sessions-RRB- to devote a concluding day to the passing of
Sentences, and to make a finishing effect with the Sentence of Death.
But for the indelible picture that my remembrance now holds before me,
I could scarcely believe, even as I write these words, that I saw
two-and-thirty men and women put before the Judge to receive that
sentence together. Foremost among the two-and-thirty was he (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>); seated,
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) might get breath enough to keep life in him (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>).

<p/>The whole scene starts out again in the vivid colors of the moment, down
to the drops of April rain on the windows of the court, glittering in
the rays of April sun. Penned in the dock, as I again stood outside it
at the corner with his (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) hand in mine, were the two-and-thirty men
and women; some defiant, some stricken with terror, some sobbing and
weeping, some covering their faces, some staring gloomily about. There
had been shrieks from among the women convicts; but they had been
stilled, and a hush had succeeded. The sheriffs with their great chains
and nosegays, other civic gewgaws and monsters, criers, ushers, a great
gallery full of people,--a large theatrical audience,--looked on, as the
two-and-thirty and the Judge were solemnly confronted. Then the Judge
addressed them. Among the wretched creatures before him (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) must
single out for special address was one who almost from his (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) infancy had
been an offender against the laws; who, after repeated imprisonments and
punishments, had been at length sentenced to exile for a term of years;
and who, under circumstances of great violence and daring, had made his (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>)
escape and been re-sentenced to exile for life. That miserable man would
seem for a time to have become convinced of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) errors, when far removed
from the scenes of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) old offences, and to have lived a peaceable and
honest life. But in a fatal moment, yielding to those propensities and
passions, the indulgence of which had so long rendered him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) a scourge to
society, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had quitted his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) haven of rest and repentance, and had
come back to the country where he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was proscribed. Being here presently
denounced, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had for a time succeeded in evading the officers of
Justice, but being at length seized while in the act of flight, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had
resisted them, and had--he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) best knew whether by express design, or in
the blindness of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hardihood--caused the death of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) denouncer, to
whom his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) whole career was known. The appointed punishment for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) return
to the land that had cast him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) out, being Death, and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) case being this
aggravated case, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) must prepare himself to Die.

<p/>The sun was striking in at the great windows of the court, through the
glittering drops of rain upon the glass, and it made a broad shaft of
light between the two-and-thirty and the Judge, linking both together,
and perhaps reminding some among the audience how both were passing on,
with absolute equality, to the greater Judgment that knoweth all things,
and cannot err. Rising for a moment, a distinct speck of face in this
way of light, the prisoner said, <div class="bookquote">``My Lord, I have received my sentence
of Death from the Almighty, but I bow to yours,''  (<font color='red'><b>the prisoner</b></font>)</div>and sat down again.
There was some hushing, and the Judge went on with what he (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) had to say
to the rest. Then they were all formally doomed, and some of them were
supported out, and some of them sauntered out with a haggard look of
bravery, and a few nodded to the gallery, and two or three shook hands,
and others went out chewing the fragments of herb they had taken from
the sweet herbs lying about. He (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) went last of all, because of having to
be helped from his (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) chair, and to go very slowly; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) held my hand
while all the others were removed, and while the audience got up
-LRB-putting their dresses right, as they might at church or elsewhere-RRB-, and
pointed down at this criminal or at that, and most of all at him (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) and me.

<p/>I earnestly hoped and prayed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) might die before the Recorder's
Report was made; but, in the dread of his (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) lingering on, I began that
night to write out a petition to the Home Secretary of State, setting
forth my knowledge of him (<font color='blue'><b>Secretary</b></font>), and how it was that he (<font color='blue'><b>Secretary</b></font>) had come back for my
sake. I wrote it as fervently and pathetically as I could; and when I
had finished it and sent it in, I wrote out other petitions to such men
in authority as I hoped were the most merciful, and drew up one to the
Crown itself. For several days and nights after he (<font color='blue'><b>Secretary</b></font>) was sentenced I took
no rest except when I fell asleep in my chair, but was wholly absorbed
in these appeals. And after I had sent them in, I could not keep away
from the places where they were, but felt as if they were more
hopeful and less desperate when I was near them. In this unreasonable
restlessness and pain of mind I would roam the streets of an evening,
wandering by those offices and houses where I had left the petitions. To
the present hour, the weary western streets of London on a cold, dusty
spring night, with their ranges of stern, shut-up mansions, and their
long rows of lamps, are melancholy to me from this association.

<p/>The daily visits I could make him (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) were shortened now, and he (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) was more
strictly kept. Seeing, or fancying, that I was suspected of an intention
of carrying poison to him (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>), I asked to be searched before I sat down
at his (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) bedside, and told the officer who was always there, that I was
willing to do anything that would assure him (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) of the singleness of my
designs. Nobody was hard with him (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) or with me. There was duty to be
done, and it was done, but not harshly. The officer always gave me the
assurance that he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) was worse, and some other sick prisoners in the
room, and some other prisoners who attended on them as sick nurses,
-LRB-malefactors, but not incapable of kindness, God be thanked!-RRB- always
joined in the same report.

<p/>As the days went on, I noticed more and more that he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) would lie placidly
looking at the white ceiling, with an absence of light in his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) face
until some word of mine brightened it for an instant, and then it would
subside again. Sometimes he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was almost or quite unable to speak, then
he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) would answer me with slight pressures on my hand, and I grew to
understand his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) meaning very well.

<p/>The number of the days had risen to ten, when I saw a greater change
in him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) than I had seen yet. His (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) eyes were turned towards the door, and
lighted up as I entered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear boy,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) said, as I sat down by his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) bed: <div class="bookquote">``I thought you was late.
But I knowed you couldn't be that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is just the time,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I. <div class="bookquote">``I waited for it at the gate.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You always waits at the gate; don't you, dear boy?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. Not to lose a moment of the time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank'ee dear boy, thank'ee. God bless you! You've never deserted me,
dear boy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I pressed his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) hand in silence, for I could not forget that I had once
meant to desert him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And what's the best of all,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``you've been more comfortable
alonger me, since I was under a dark cloud, than when the sun shone.
That's best of all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) lay on his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) back, breathing with great difficulty. Do what he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) would,
and love me though he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) did, the light left his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) face ever and again, and a
film came over the placid look at the white ceiling.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you in much pain to-day?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't complain of none, dear boy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You never do complain.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had spoken his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) last words. He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) smiled, and I understood his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) touch to
mean that he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) wished to lift my hand, and lay it on his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) breast. I laid it
there, and he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) smiled again, and put both his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) hands upon it.

<p/>The allotted time ran out, while we were thus; but, looking round, I
found the governor of the prison standing near me, and he (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>) whispered,
<div class="bookquote">``You needn't go yet.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>I thanked him (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>) gratefully, and asked, <div class="bookquote">``Might I
speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), if he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) can hear me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>The governor stepped aside, and beckoned the officer away. The change,
though it was made without noise, drew back the film from the placid
look at the white ceiling, and he (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>) looked most affectionately at me.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear Magwitch, I must tell you now, at last. You understand what I
say?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>A gentle pressure on my hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You had a child once, whom you loved and lost.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>A stronger pressure on my hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) lived, and found powerful friends. She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) is living now. She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) is a lady
and very beautiful. And I love her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>With a last faint effort, which would have been powerless but for my
yielding to it and assisting it, he (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>) raised my hand to his (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>) lips. Then,
he (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>) gently let it sink upon his (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>) breast again, with his (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>) own hands lying on
it. The placid look at the white ceiling came back, and passed away, and
his (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>) head dropped quietly on his (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>) breast.

<p/>Mindful, then, of what we had read together, I thought of the two men
who went up into the Temple to pray, and I knew there were no better
words that I could say beside his (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>) bed, than <div class="bookquote">``O Lord, be merciful to him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>)
a sinner!''




 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Chapter LVII

<p/>Now that I was left wholly to myself, I gave notice of my intention
to quit the chambers in the Temple as soon as my tenancy could legally
determine, and in the meanwhile to underlet them. At once I put bills
up in the windows; for, I was in debt, and had scarcely any money, and
began to be seriously alarmed by the state of my affairs. I ought
rather to write that I should have been alarmed if I had had energy and
concentration enough to help me to the clear perception of any truth
beyond the fact that I was falling very ill. The late stress upon me had
enabled me to put off illness, but not to put it away; I knew that it
was coming on me now, and I knew very little else, and was even careless
as to that.

<p/>For a day or two, I lay on the sofa, or on the floor,--anywhere,
according as I happened to sink down,--with a heavy head and aching
limbs, and no purpose, and no power. Then there came, one night which
appeared of great duration, and which teemed with anxiety and horror;
and when in the morning I tried to sit up in my bed and think of it, I
found I could not do so.

<p/>Whether I really had been down in Garden Court in the dead of the night,
groping about for the boat that I supposed to be there; whether I had
two or three times come to myself on the staircase with great terror,
not knowing how I had got out of bed; whether I had found myself
lighting the lamp, possessed by the idea that he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) was coming up
the stairs, and that the lights were blown out; whether I had been
inexpressibly harassed by the distracted talking, laughing, and groaning
of some one, and had half suspected those sounds to be of my own making;
whether there had been a closed iron furnace in a dark corner of
the room, and a voice had called out, over and over again, that Miss
Havisham was consuming within it,--these were things that I tried to
settle with myself and get into some order, as I lay that morning on
my bed. But the vapor of a limekiln would come between me and them,
disordering them all, and it was through the vapor at last that I saw
two men looking at me.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you want?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked, starting; <div class="bookquote">``I don't know you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>returned one of them, bending down and touching me on the
shoulder, <div class="bookquote">``this is a matter that you'll soon arrange, I dare say, but
you're arrested.''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What is the debt?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hundred and twenty-three pound, fifteen, six. Jeweller's account, I
think.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What is to be done?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You had better come to my house,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the man. <div class="bookquote">``I keep a very nice
house.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I made some attempt to get up and dress myself. When I next attended
to them, they were standing a little off from the bed, looking at me. I
still lay there.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You see my state,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I. <div class="bookquote">``I would come with you if I could; but
indeed I am quite unable. If you take me from here, I think I shall die
by the way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div><p/>Perhaps they replied, or argued the point, or tried to encourage me to
believe that I was better than I thought. Forasmuch as they hang in
my memory by only this one slender thread, I don't know what they did,
except that they forbore to remove me.

<p/>That I had a fever and was avoided, that I suffered greatly, that
I often lost my reason, that the time seemed interminable, that I
confounded impossible existences with my own identity; that I was a
brick in the house-wall, and yet entreating to be released from the
giddy place where the builders had set me; that I was a steel beam of a
vast engine, clashing and whirling over a gulf, and yet that I implored
in my own person to have the engine stopped, and my part in it hammered
off; that I passed through these phases of disease, I know of my own
remembrance, and did in some sort know at the time. That I sometimes
struggled with real people, in the belief that they were murderers, and
that I would all at once comprehend that they meant to do me good, and
would then sink exhausted in their arms, and suffer them to lay me
down, I also knew at the time. But, above all, I knew that there was a
constant tendency in all these people,--who, when I was very ill, would
present all kinds of extraordinary transformations of the human face,
and would be much dilated in size,--above all, I say, I knew that there
was an extraordinary tendency in all these people, sooner or later, to
settle down into the likeness of Joe.

<p/>After I had turned the worst point of my illness, I began to notice that
while all its other features changed, this one consistent feature did
not change. Whoever came about me, still settled down into Joe. I opened
my eyes in the night, and I saw, in the great chair at the bedside, Joe.
I opened my eyes in the day, and, sitting on the window-seat, smoking
his (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) pipe in the shaded open window, still I saw Joe. I asked for cooling
drink, and the dear hand that gave it me was Joe's. I sank back on
my pillow after drinking, and the face that looked so hopefully and
tenderly upon me was the face of Joe.

<p/>At last, one day, I took courage, and said, <div class="bookquote">``Is it Joe?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>And the dear old home-voice answered, <div class="bookquote">``Which it air, old chap.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``O Joe, you break my heart! Look angry at me, Joe. Strike me, Joe. Tell
me of my ingratitude. Don't be so good to me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div><p/>For Joe had actually laid his (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) head down on the pillow at my side, and
put his (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) arm round my neck, in his (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) joy that I knew him (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Which dear old Pip, old chap,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>said Joe, <div class="bookquote">``you and me was ever friends.
And when you're well enough to go out for a ride--what larks!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div><p/>After which, Joe withdrew to the window, and stood with his (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) back towards
me, wiping his (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) eyes. And as my extreme weakness prevented me from
getting up and going to him (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>), I lay there, penitently whispering, <div class="bookquote">``O God
bless him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)! O God bless this gentle Christian man!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Joe's eyes were red when I next found him (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) beside me; but I was holding
his (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) hand, and we both felt happy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How long, dear Joe?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Which you meantersay, Pip, how long have your illness lasted, dear old
chap?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Joe.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's the end of May, Pip. To-morrow is the first of June.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And have you been here all that time, dear Joe?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pretty nigh, old chap. For, as I says to Biddy when the news of your
being ill were brought by letter, which it were brought by the post, and
being formerly single he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) is now married though underpaid for a deal of
walking and shoe-leather, but wealth were not a object on his (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) part, and
marriage were the great wish of his (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) hart--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is so delightful to hear you, Joe! But I interrupt you in what you
said to Biddy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Which it were,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>said Joe, <div class="bookquote">``that how you might be amongst strangers, and
that how you and me having been ever friends, a wisit at such a moment
might not prove unacceptabobble. And Biddy, her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) word were, `Go to him (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>),
without loss of time.' That,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>said Joe, summing up with his (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) judicial
air, <div class="bookquote">``were the word of Biddy. `Go to him (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>),' Biddy say, `without loss of
time.' In short, I shouldn't greatly deceive you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>Joe added, after a
little grave reflection, ``if I represented to you that the word of that
young woman were, `without a minute's loss of time.'''

<p/>There Joe cut himself short, and informed me that I was to be talked
to in great moderation, and that I was to take a little nourishment at
stated frequent times, whether I felt inclined for it or not, and that
I was to submit myself to all his (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) orders. So I kissed his (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) hand, and lay
quiet, while he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) proceeded to indite a note to Biddy, with my love in it.

<p/>Evidently Biddy had taught Joe to write. As I lay in bed looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>),
it made me, in my weak state, cry again with pleasure to see the
pride with which he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) set about his (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) letter. My bedstead, divested of its
curtains, had been removed, with me upon it, into the sitting-room, as
the airiest and largest, and the carpet had been taken away, and
the room kept always fresh and wholesome night and day. At my own
writing-table, pushed into a corner and cumbered with little bottles,
Joe now sat down to his (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) great work, first choosing a pen from the
pen-tray as if it were a chest of large tools, and tucking up his (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>)
sleeves as if he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) were going to wield a crow-bar or sledgehammer. It was
necessary for Joe to hold on heavily to the table with his (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) left elbow,
and to get his (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) right leg well out behind him (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>), before he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) could begin; and
when he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) did begin he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) made every downstroke so slowly that it might
have been six feet long, while at every upstroke I could hear his (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) pen
spluttering extensively. He (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) had a curious idea that the inkstand was
on the side of him (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) where it was not, and constantly dipped his (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) pen into
space, and seemed quite satisfied with the result. Occasionally, he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) was
tripped up by some orthographical stumbling-block; but on the whole
he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) got on very well indeed; and when he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) had signed his (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) name, and had
removed a finishing blot from the paper to the crown of his (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) head with
his (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) two forefingers, he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) got up and hovered about the table, trying the
effect of his (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) performance from various points of view, as it lay there,
with unbounded satisfaction.

<p/>Not to make Joe uneasy by talking too much, even if I had been able to
talk much, I deferred asking him (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) about Miss Havisham until next day. He (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>)
shook his (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) head when I then asked him (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) if she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) had recovered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) dead, Joe?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why you see, old chap,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>said Joe, in a tone of remonstrance, and by way
of getting at it by degrees, <div class="bookquote">``I wouldn't go so far as to say that, for
that's a deal to say; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) ain't--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Living, Joe?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's nigher where it is,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>said Joe; <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) ain't living.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) linger long, Joe?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Arter you was took ill, pretty much about what you might call -LRB-if you
was put to it-RRB- a week,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>said Joe; still determined, on my account, to
come at everything by degrees.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear Joe, have you heard what becomes of her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) property?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, old chap,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>said Joe, <div class="bookquote">``it do appear that she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) had settled the most
of it, which I meantersay tied it up, on Miss Estella. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) had
wrote out a little coddleshell in her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) own hand a day or two afore the
accident, leaving a cool four thousand to Mr. Matthew Pocket. And why,
do you suppose, above all things, Pip, she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) left that cool four thousand
unto him (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>)? `Because of Pip's account of him (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>), the said Matthew.' I am told
by Biddy, that air the writing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>said Joe, repeating the legal turn as
if it did him (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) infinite good, ```account of him (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) the said Matthew.' And a
cool four thousand, Pip!''

<p/>I never discovered from whom Joe derived the conventional temperature of
the four thousand pounds; but it appeared to make the sum of money more
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) had a manifest relish in insisting on its being cool.

<p/>This account gave me great joy, as it perfected the only good thing I
had done. I asked Joe whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) had heard if any of the other relations
had any legacies?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Sarah,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>said Joe, <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) have twenty-five pound perannium fur to
buy pills, on account of being bilious. Miss Georgiana, she (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) have twenty
pound down. Mrs.--what's the name of them wild beasts with humps, old
chap?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Camels?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, wondering why he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) could possibly want to know.

<p/>Joe nodded. <div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Camels,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>by which I presently understood he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) meant
Camilla, <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>Camels</b></font>) have five pound fur to buy rushlights to put her (<font color='blue'><b>Camels</b></font>) in
spirits when she (<font color='blue'><b>Camels</b></font>) wake up in the night.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Camilla/Mrs. Camilla</b></font>)</div><p/>The accuracy of these recitals was sufficiently obvious to me, to give
me great confidence in Joe's information. <div class="bookquote">``And now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>said Joe, <div class="bookquote">``you
ain't that strong yet, old chap, that you can take in more nor one
additional shovelful to-day. Old Orlick he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>)'s been a bustin' open a
dwelling-ouse.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Whose?''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not, I grant you, but what his (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) manners is given to blusterous,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said
Joe, apologetically; <div class="bookquote">``still, a Englishman's ouse is his (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) Castle, and
castles must not be busted `cept when done in war time. And wotsume’er
the failings on his (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) part, he (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) were a corn and seedsman in his (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) hart.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it Pumblechook's house that has been broken into, then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's it, Pip,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>said Joe; <div class="bookquote">``and they took his (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) till, and they took his (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>)
cash-box, and they drinked his (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) wine, and they partook of his (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) wittles,
and they slapped his (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) face, and they pulled his (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) nose, and they tied him (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>)
up to his (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) bedpust, and they giv' him (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) a dozen, and they stuffed his (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>)
mouth full of flowering annuals to prewent his (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) crying out. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) knowed
Orlick, and Orlick's in the county jail.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div><p/>By these approaches we arrived at unrestricted conversation. I was slow
to gain strength, but I did slowly and surely become less weak, and Joe
stayed with me, and I fancied I was little Pip again.

<p/>For the tenderness of Joe was so beautifully proportioned to my need,
that I was like a child in his (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) hands. He (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) would sit and talk to me in the
old confidence, and with the old simplicity, and in the old unassertive
protecting way, so that I would half believe that all my life since the
days of the old kitchen was one of the mental troubles of the fever that
was gone. He (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) did everything for me except the household work, for which
he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) had engaged a very decent woman, after paying off the laundress on
his (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) first arrival. <div class="bookquote">``Which I do assure you, Pip,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) would often say, in
explanation of that liberty; <div class="bookquote">``I found her (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) a tapping the spare bed, like
a cask of beer, and drawing off the feathers in a bucket, for sale.
Which she (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) would have tapped yourn next, and draw'd it off with you a
laying on it, and was then a carrying away the coals gradiwally in
the soup-tureen and wegetable-dishes, and the wine and spirits in your
Wellington boots.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>We looked forward to the day when I should go out for a ride, as we had
once looked forward to the day of my apprenticeship. And when the day
came, and an open carriage was got into the Lane, Joe wrapped me up,
took me in his (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) arms, carried me down to it, and put me in, as if I were
still the small helpless creature to whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) had so abundantly given of
the wealth of his (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) great nature.

<p/>And Joe got in beside me, and we drove away together into the country,
where the rich summer growth was already on the trees and on the grass,
and sweet summer scents filled all the air. The day happened to be
Sunday, and when I looked on the loveliness around me, and thought
how it had grown and changed, and how the little wild-flowers had been
forming, and the voices of the birds had been strengthening, by day and
by night, under the sun and under the stars, while poor I lay burning
and tossing on my bed, the mere remembrance of having burned and tossed
there came like a check upon my peace. But when I heard the Sunday
bells, and looked around a little more upon the outspread beauty, I felt
that I was not nearly thankful enough,--that I was too weak yet to be
even that,--and I laid my head on Joe's shoulder, as I had laid it long
ago when he (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) had taken me to the Fair or where not, and it was too much
for my young senses.

<p/>More composure came to me after a while, and we talked as we used
to talk, lying on the grass at the old Battery. There was no change
whatever in Joe. Exactly what he (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) had been in my eyes then, he (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) was in my
eyes still; just as simply faithful, and as simply right.

<p/>When we got back again, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) lifted me out, and carried me--so
easily!--across the court and up the stairs, I thought of that eventful
Christmas Day when he (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) had carried me over the marshes. We had not yet
made any allusion to my change of fortune, nor did I know how much of
my late history he (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) was acquainted with. I was so doubtful of myself now,
and put so much trust in him (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>), that I could not satisfy myself whether I
ought to refer to it when he (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) did not.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you heard, Joe,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) that evening, upon further
consideration, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) smoked his (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) pipe at the window, <div class="bookquote">``who my patron was?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I heerd,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>returned Joe, <div class="bookquote">``as it were not Miss Havisham, old chap.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did you hear who it was, Joe?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well! I heerd as it were a person what sent the person what giv' you
the bank-notes at the Jolly Bargemen, Pip.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So it was.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Astonishing!''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>said Joe, in the placidest way.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Did you hear that he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) was dead, Joe?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I presently asked, with increasing
diffidence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Which? Him (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) as sent the bank-notes, Pip?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>said Joe, after meditating a long time, and looking rather
evasively at the window-seat, <div class="bookquote">``as I did hear tell that how he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) were
something or another in a general way in that direction.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did you hear anything of his (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) circumstances, Joe?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not partickler, Pip.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you would like to hear, Joe--''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I was beginning, when Joe got up and
came to my sofa.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Lookee here, old chap,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>said Joe, bending over me. <div class="bookquote">``Ever the best of
friends; ain't us, Pip?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I was ashamed to answer him (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Wery good, then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>said Joe, as if I had answered; <div class="bookquote">``that's all right;
that's agreed upon. Then why go into subjects, old chap, which as
betwixt two sech must be for ever onnecessary? There's subjects enough
as betwixt two sech, without onnecessary ones. Lord! To think of your
poor sister and her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) Rampages! And don't you remember Tickler?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do indeed, Joe.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Lookee here, old chap,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>said Joe. <div class="bookquote">``I done what I could to keep you
and Tickler in sunders, but my power were not always fully equal to my
inclinations. For when your poor sister had a mind to drop into you, it
were not so much,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>said Joe, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) favorite argumentative way, ``that
she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) dropped into me too, if I put myself in opposition to her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>), but that
she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) dropped into you always heavier for it. I noticed that. It ain't a
grab at a man's whisker, not yet a shake or two of a man -LRB-to which your
sister was quite welcome-RRB-, that `ud put a man off from getting a little
child out of punishment. But when that little child is dropped into
heavier for that grab of whisker or shaking, then that man naterally up
and says to himself, `Where is the good as you are a doing? I grant you
I see the `arm,' says the man, `but I don't see the good. I call upon
you, sir, therefore, to pint out the good.'''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The man says?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I observed, as Joe waited for me to speak.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The man says,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>Joe assented. <div class="bookquote">``Is he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) right, that man?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear Joe, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is always right.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, old chap,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>said Joe, <div class="bookquote">``then abide by your words. If he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>)'s always
right -LRB-which in general he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>)'s more likely wrong-RRB-, he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>)'s right when he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) says
this: Supposing ever you kep any little matter to yourself, when you
was a little child, you kep it mostly because you know'd as J. Gargery's
power to part you and Tickler in sunders were not fully equal to his (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>)
inclinations. Theerfore, think no more of it as betwixt two sech, and do
not let us pass remarks upon onnecessary subjects. Biddy giv' herself a
deal o' trouble with me afore I left -LRB-for I am almost awful dull-RRB-, as I
should view it in this light, and, viewing it in this light, as I should
so put it. Both of which,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>said Joe, quite charmed with his (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) logical
arrangement, <div class="bookquote">``being done, now this to you a true friend, say. Namely.
You mustn't go a overdoing on it, but you must have your supper and your
wine and water, and you must be put betwixt the sheets.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div><p/>The delicacy with which Joe dismissed this theme, and the sweet tact and
kindness with which Biddy--who with her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) woman's wit had found me out so
soon--had prepared him (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) for it, made a deep impression on my mind. But
whether Joe knew how poor I was, and how my great expectations had
all dissolved, like our own marsh mists before the sun, I could not
understand.

<p/>Another thing in Joe that I could not understand when it first began to
develop itself, but which I soon arrived at a sorrowful comprehension
of, was this: As I became stronger and better, Joe became a little less
easy with me. In my weakness and entire dependence on him (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>), the dear
fellow had fallen into the old tone, and called me by the old names,
the dear <div class="bookquote">``old Pip, old chap,''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>that now were music in my ears. I too had
fallen into the old ways, only happy and thankful that he (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) let me. But,
imperceptibly, though I held by them fast, Joe's hold upon them began
to slacken; and whereas I wondered at this, at first, I soon began to
understand that the cause of it was in me, and that the fault of it was
all mine.

<p/>Ah! Had I given Joe no reason to doubt my constancy, and to think that
in prosperity I should grow cold to him (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) and cast him (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) off? Had I given
Joe's innocent heart no cause to feel instinctively that as I got
stronger, his (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) hold upon me would be weaker, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) had better
loosen it in time and let me go, before I plucked myself away?

<p/>It was on the third or fourth occasion of my going out walking in the
Temple Gardens leaning on Joe's arm, that I saw this change in him (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) very
plainly. We had been sitting in the bright warm sunlight, looking at the
river, and I chanced to say as we got up,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``See, Joe! I can walk quite strongly. Now, you shall see me walk back by
myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Which do not overdo it, Pip,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>said Joe; <div class="bookquote">``but I shall be happy fur to
see you able, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div><p/>The last word grated on me; but how could I remonstrate! I walked no
further than the gate of the gardens, and then pretended to be
weaker than I was, and asked Joe for his (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) arm. Joe gave it me, but was
thoughtful.

<p/>I, for my part, was thoughtful too; for, how best to check this growing
change in Joe was a great perplexity to my remorseful thoughts. That I
was ashamed to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) exactly how I was placed, and what I had come
down to, I do not seek to conceal; but I hope my reluctance was not
quite an unworthy one. He (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) would want to help me out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) little
savings, I knew, and I knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) ought not to help me, and that I
must not suffer him (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) to do it.

<p/>It was a thoughtful evening with both of us. But, before we went to
bed, I had resolved that I would wait over to-morrow,--to-morrow being
Sunday,--and would begin my new course with the new week. On Monday
morning I would speak to Joe about this change, I would lay aside this
last vestige of reserve, I would tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) what I had in my thoughts
-LRB-that Secondly, not yet arrived at-RRB-, and why I had not decided to go
out to Herbert, and then the change would be conquered for ever. As I
cleared, Joe cleared, and it seemed as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) had sympathetically
arrived at a resolution too.

<p/>We had a quiet day on the Sunday, and we rode out into the country, and
then walked in the fields.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I feel thankful that I have been ill, Joe,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear old Pip, old chap, you're a'most come round, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It has been a memorable time for me, Joe.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Likeways for myself, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>Joe returned.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We have had a time together, Joe, that I can never forget. There were
days once, I know, that I did for a while forget; but I never shall
forget these.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pip,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>said Joe, appearing a little hurried and troubled, <div class="bookquote">``there has
been larks. And, dear sir, what have been betwixt us--have been.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div><p/>At night, when I had gone to bed, Joe came into my room, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) had done
all through my recovery. He (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) asked me if I felt sure that I was as well
as in the morning?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, dear Joe, quite.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And are always a getting stronger, old chap?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, dear Joe, steadily.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div><p/>Joe patted the coverlet on my shoulder with his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) great good hand, and
said, in what I thought a husky voice, <div class="bookquote">``Good night!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>When I got up in the morning, refreshed and stronger yet, I was full of
my resolution to tell Joe all, without delay. I would tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) before
breakfast. I would dress at once and go to his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) room and surprise him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>);
for, it was the first day I had been up early. I went to his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) room, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) was not there. Not only was he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) not there, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) box was gone.

<p/>I hurried then to the breakfast-table, and on it found a letter. These
were its brief contents:--

<p/>``Not wishful to intrude I have departured fur you are well again dear
Pip and will do better without JO.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``P.S. Ever the best of friends.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Enclosed in the letter was a receipt for the debt and costs on which I
had been arrested. Down to that moment, I had vainly supposed that my
creditor had withdrawn, or suspended proceedings until I should be quite
recovered. I had never dreamed of Joe's having paid the money; but Joe
had paid it, and the receipt was in his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) name.

<p/>What remained for me now, but to follow him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) to the dear old forge, and
there to have out my disclosure to him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>), and my penitent remonstrance
with him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>), and there to relieve my mind and heart of that reserved
Secondly, which had begun as a vague something lingering in my thoughts,
and had formed into a settled purpose?

<p/>The purpose was, that I would go to Biddy, that I would show her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) how
humbled and repentant I came back, that I would tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) how I had lost
all I once hoped for, that I would remind her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) of our old confidences in
my first unhappy time. Then I would say to her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``Biddy, I think you once
liked me very well, when my errant heart, even while it strayed away
from you, was quieter and better with you than it ever has been since.
If you can like me only half as well once more, if you can take me with
all my faults and disappointments on my head, if you can receive me like
a forgiven child -LRB-and indeed I am as sorry, Biddy, and have as much need
of a hushing voice and a soothing hand-RRB-, I hope I am a little worthier
of you that I was,--not much, but a little. And, Biddy, it shall rest
with you to say whether I shall work at the forge with Joe, or whether I
shall try for any different occupation down in this country, or whether
we shall go away to a distant place where an opportunity awaits me which
I set aside, when it was offered, until I knew your answer. And now,
dear Biddy, if you can tell me that you will go through the world with
me, you will surely make it a better world for me, and me a better man
for it, and I will try hard to make it a better world for you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>Such was my purpose. After three days more of recovery, I went down to
the old place to put it in execution. And how I sped in it is all I have
left to tell.




<p/>Chapter LVIII

<p/>The tidings of my high fortunes having had a heavy fall had got down
to my native place and its neighborhood before I got there. I found the
Blue Boar in possession of the intelligence, and I found that it made a
great change in the Boar's demeanour. Whereas the Boar had cultivated
my good opinion with warm assiduity when I was coming into property,
the Boar was exceedingly cool on the subject now that I was going out of
property.

<p/>It was evening when I arrived, much fatigued by the journey I had so
often made so easily. The Boar could not put me into my usual bedroom,
which was engaged -LRB-probably by some one who had expectations-RRB-, and
could only assign me a very indifferent chamber among the pigeons and
post-chaises up the yard. But I had as sound a sleep in that lodging as
in the most superior accommodation the Boar could have given me, and the
quality of my dreams was about the same as in the best bedroom.

<p/>Early in the morning, while my breakfast was getting ready, I strolled
round by Satis House. There were printed bills on the gate and on bits
of carpet hanging out of the windows, announcing a sale by auction of
the Household Furniture and Effects, next week. The House itself was to
be sold as old building materials, and pulled down. LOT 1 was marked in
whitewashed knock-knee letters on the brew house; LOT 2 on that part of
the main building which had been so long shut up. Other lots were marked
off on other parts of the structure, and the ivy had been torn down to
make room for the inscriptions, and much of it trailed low in the dust
and was withered already. Stepping in for a moment at the open gate, and
looking around me with the uncomfortable air of a stranger who had no
business there, I saw the auctioneer's clerk walking on the casks and
telling them off for the information of a catalogue-compiler, pen in
hand, who made a temporary desk of the wheeled chair I had so often
pushed along to the tune of Old Clem.

<p/>When I got back to my breakfast in the Boar's coffee-room, I found Mr.
Pumblechook conversing with the landlord. Mr. Pumblechook -LRB-not improved
in appearance by his (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) late nocturnal adventure-RRB- was waiting for me, and
addressed me in the following terms:--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Young man, I am sorry to see you brought low. But what else could be
expected! what else could be expected!''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) extended his (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) hand with a magnificently forgiving air, and as I was
broken by illness and unfit to quarrel, I took it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``William,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Pumblechook/Pumblechook</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Pumblechook to the waiter, <div class="bookquote">``put a muffin on table.
And has it come to this! Has it come to this!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the waiter</b></font>)</div><p/>I frowningly sat down to my breakfast. Mr. Pumblechook stood over me and
poured out my tea--before I could touch the teapot--with the air of a
benefactor who was resolved to be true to the last.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``William,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Pumblechook/Pumblechook</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Pumblechook, mournfully, <div class="bookquote">``put the salt on. In
happier times,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Pumblechook/Pumblechook</b></font>)</div>addressing me, <div class="bookquote">``I think you took sugar? And did you take
milk? You did. Sugar and milk. William, bring a watercress.''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, shortly, <div class="bookquote">``but I don't eat watercresses.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't eat `em,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Pumblechook/Pumblechook</b></font>)</div>returned Mr. Pumblechook, sighing and nodding
his (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) head several times, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) might have expected that, and as if
abstinence from watercresses were consistent with my downfall. <div class="bookquote">``True.
The simple fruits of the earth. No. You needn't bring any, William.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I went on with my breakfast, and Mr. Pumblechook continued to stand over
me, staring fishily and breathing noisily, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) always did.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Little more than skin and bone!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Pumblechook/Pumblechook</b></font>)</div>mused Mr. Pumblechook, aloud. <div class="bookquote">``And yet
when he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) went from here -LRB-I may say with my blessing-RRB-, and I spread afore
him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) my humble store, like the Bee, he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) was as plump as a Peach!''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>This reminded me of the wonderful difference between the servile manner
in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) had offered his (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) hand in my new prosperity, saying, <div class="bookquote">``May I?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and the ostentatious clemency with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) had just now exhibited the
same fat five fingers.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hah!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) went on, handing me the bread and butter. <div class="bookquote">``And air you a going
to Joseph?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In heaven's name,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, firing in spite of myself, <div class="bookquote">``what does it
matter to you where I am going? Leave that teapot alone.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>It was the worst course I could have taken, because it gave Pumblechook
the opportunity he (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) wanted.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, young man,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>), releasing the handle of the article in
question, retiring a step or two from my table, and speaking for the
behoof of the landlord and waiter at the door, <div class="bookquote">``I will leave that teapot
alone. You are right, young man. For once you are right. I forgit myself
when I take such an interest in your breakfast, as to wish your frame,
exhausted by the debilitating effects of prodigygality, to be stimilated
by the `olesome nourishment of your forefathers. And yet,''  (<font color='red'><b>waiter</b></font>)</div>said
Pumblechook, turning to the landlord and waiter, and pointing me out at
arm's length, <div class="bookquote">``this is him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) as I ever sported with in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) days of happy
infancy! Tell me not it cannot be; I tell you this is him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>A low murmur from the two replied. The waiter appeared to be
particularly affected.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This is him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Pumblechook/Pumblechook</b></font>)</div>said Pumblechook, <div class="bookquote">``as I have rode in my shay-cart. This
is him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) as I have seen brought up by hand. This is him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) untoe the sister
of which I was uncle by marriage, as her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) name was Georgiana M’ria from
her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) own mother, let him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) deny it if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) can!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Pumblechook/Pumblechook</b></font>)</div><p/>The waiter seemed convinced that I could not deny it, and that it gave
the case a black look.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Young man,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Pumblechook/Pumblechook</b></font>)</div>said Pumblechook, screwing his (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) head at me in the old
fashion, <div class="bookquote">``you air a going to Joseph. What does it matter to me, you
ask me, where you air a going? I say to you, Sir, you air a going to
Joseph.''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>The waiter coughed, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) modestly invited me to get over that.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Pumblechook/Pumblechook</b></font>)</div>said Pumblechook, and all this with a most exasperating air
of saying in the cause of virtue what was perfectly convincing and
conclusive, <div class="bookquote">``I will tell you what to say to Joseph. Here is Squires of
the Boar present, known and respected in this town, and here is William,
which his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) father's name was Potkins if I do not deceive myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Pumblechook/Pumblechook</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You do not, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>William</b></font>)</div>said William.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``In their presence,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Pumblechook/Pumblechook</b></font>)</div>pursued Pumblechook, ``I will tell you, young
man, what to say to Joseph. Says you, <div class="bookquote">``Joseph, I have this day seen
my earliest benefactor and the founder of my fortun's. I will name no
names, Joseph, but so they are pleased to call him (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) up town, and I have
seen that man.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I swear I don't see him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) here,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Say that likewise,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>retorted Pumblechook. <div class="bookquote">``Say you said that, and even
Joseph will probably betray surprise.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There you quite mistake him (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I. <div class="bookquote">``I know better.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Says you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joseph/Joseph Gargery</b></font>)</div>Pumblechook went on, ```Joseph, I have seen that man, and
that man bears you no malice and bears me no malice. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knows your
character, Joseph, and is well acquainted with your pig-headedness and
ignorance; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) knows my character, Joseph, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) knows my want of
gratitoode. Yes, Joseph,' says you,'' here Pumblechook shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) head and
hand at me, ```he (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) knows my total deficiency of common human gratitoode.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) knows it, Joseph, as none can. You do not know it, Joseph, having no
call to know it, but that man do.'''

<p/>Windy donkey as he (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) was, it really amazed me that he (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) could have the face
to talk thus to mine.

<p/>``Says you, `Joseph, he (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) gave me a little message, which I will now
repeat. It was that, in my being brought low, he (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) saw the finger of
Providence. He (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) knowed that finger when he (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) saw Joseph, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) saw it
plain. It pinted out this writing, Joseph. Reward of ingratitoode to his (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>)
earliest benefactor, and founder of fortun's. But that man said he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did
not repent of what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had done, Joseph. Not at all. It was right to do
it, it was kind to do it, it was benevolent to do it, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) would do it
again.'''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's pity,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, scornfully, as I finished my interrupted breakfast,
<div class="bookquote">``that the man did not say what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had done and would do again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Squires of the Boar!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Pumblechook/Pumblechook</b></font>)</div>Pumblechook was now addressing the landlord, <div class="bookquote">``and
William! I have no objections to your mentioning, either up town or down
town, if such should be your wishes, that it was right to do it, kind to
do it, benevolent to do it, and that I would do it again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Pumblechook/Pumblechook</b></font>)</div><p/>With those words the Impostor shook them both by the hand, with an air,
and left the house; leaving me much more astonished than delighted by
the virtues of that same indefinite <div class="bookquote">``it.''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>I was not long after him (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) in
leaving the house too, and when I went down the High Street I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>)
holding forth -LRB-no doubt to the same effect-RRB- at his (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) shop door to a select
group, who honored me with very unfavorable glances as I passed on the
opposite side of the way.

<p/>But, it was only the pleasanter to turn to Biddy and to Joe, whose
great forbearance shone more brightly than before, if that could be,
contrasted with this brazen pretender. I went towards them slowly, for
my limbs were weak, but with a sense of increasing relief as I drew
nearer to them, and a sense of leaving arrogance and untruthfulness
further and further behind.

<p/>The June weather was delicious. The sky was blue, the larks were soaring
high over the green corn, I thought all that countryside more beautiful
and peaceful by far than I had ever known it to be yet. Many pleasant
pictures of the life that I would lead there, and of the change for the
better that would come over my character when I had a guiding spirit at
my side whose simple faith and clear home wisdom I had proved, beguiled
my way. They awakened a tender emotion in me; for my heart was softened
by my return, and such a change had come to pass, that I felt like one
who was toiling home barefoot from distant travel, and whose wanderings
had lasted many years.

<p/>The schoolhouse where Biddy was mistress I had never seen; but, the
little roundabout lane by which I entered the village, for quietness'
sake, took me past it. I was disappointed to find that the day was a
holiday; no children were there, and Biddy's house was closed. Some
hopeful notion of seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>), busily engaged in her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) daily duties, before
she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) saw me, had been in my mind and was defeated.

<p/>But the forge was a very short distance off, and I went towards it under
the sweet green limes, listening for the clink of Joe's hammer. Long
after I ought to have heard it, and long after I had fancied I heard it
and found it but a fancy, all was still. The limes were there, and the
white thorns were there, and the chestnut-trees were there, and their
leaves rustled harmoniously when I stopped to listen; but, the clink of
Joe's hammer was not in the midsummer wind.

<p/>Almost fearing, without knowing why, to come in view of the forge, I saw
it at last, and saw that it was closed. No gleam of fire, no glittering
shower of sparks, no roar of bellows; all shut up, and still.

<p/>But the house was not deserted, and the best parlor seemed to be in use,
for there were white curtains fluttering in its window, and the window
was open and gay with flowers. I went softly towards it, meaning to peep
over the flowers, when Joe and Biddy stood before me, arm in arm.

<p/>At first Biddy gave a cry, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) thought it was my apparition, but
in another moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) was in my embrace. I wept to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) wept
to see me; I, because she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) looked so fresh and pleasant; she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>), because I
looked so worn and white.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But dear Biddy, how smart you are!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, dear Pip.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And Joe, how smart you are!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, dear old Pip, old chap.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I looked at both of them, from one to the other, and then--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's my wedding-day!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>cried Biddy, in a burst of happiness, <div class="bookquote">``and I am
married to Joe!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Biddy</b></font>)</div><p/>They had taken me into the kitchen, and I had laid my head down on
the old deal table. Biddy held one of my hands to her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) lips, and Joe's
restoring touch was on my shoulder. <div class="bookquote">``Which he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) warn't strong enough, my
dear, fur to be surprised,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>said Joe. And Biddy said, <div class="bookquote">``I ought to
have thought of it, dear Joe, but I was too happy.''  (<font color='red'><b>Biddy</b></font>)</div>They were both so
overjoyed to see me, so proud to see me, so touched by my coming to
them, so delighted that I should have come by accident to make their day
complete!

<p/>My first thought was one of great thankfulness that I had never breathed
this last baffled hope to Joe. How often, while he (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) was with me in my
illness, had it risen to my lips! How irrevocable would have been his (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>)
knowledge of it, if he (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) had remained with me but another hour!

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear Biddy,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, <div class="bookquote">``you have the best husband in the whole world,
and if you could have seen him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) by my bed you would have--But no, you
couldn't love him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) better than you do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I couldn't indeed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Biddy</b></font>)</div>said Biddy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And, dear Joe, you have the best wife in the whole world, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) will
make you as happy as even you deserve to be, you dear, good, noble Joe!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div><p/>Joe looked at me with a quivering lip, and fairly put his (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) sleeve before
his (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And Joe and Biddy both, as you have been to church to-day, and are in
charity and love with all mankind, receive my humble thanks for all you
have done for me, and all I have so ill repaid! And when I say that I am
going away within the hour, for I am soon going abroad, and that I shall
never rest until I have worked for the money with which you have kept me
out of prison, and have sent it to you, don't think, dear Joe and Biddy,
that if I could repay it a thousand times over, I suppose I could cancel
a farthing of the debt I owe you, or that I would do so if I could!''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>They were both melted by these words, and both entreated me to say no
more.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But I must say more. Dear Joe, I hope you will have children to love,
and that some little fellow will sit in this chimney-corner of a winter
night, who may remind you of another little fellow gone out of it for
ever. Don't tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>), Joe, that I was thankless; don't tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>), Biddy,
that I was ungenerous and unjust; only tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) that I honored you both,
because you were both so good and true, and that, as your child, I said
it would be natural to him (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) to grow up a much better man than I did.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I ain't a going,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>said Joe, from behind his (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) sleeve, <div class="bookquote">``to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>)
nothink o' that natur, Pip. Nor Biddy ain't. Nor yet no one ain't.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And now, though I know you have already done it in your own kind
hearts, pray tell me, both, that you forgive me! Pray let me hear you
say the words, that I may carry the sound of them away with me, and then
I shall be able to believe that you can trust me, and think better of
me, in the time to come!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``O dear old Pip, old chap,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>said Joe. <div class="bookquote">``God knows as I forgive you, if I
have anythink to forgive!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Amen! And God knows I do!''  (<font color='red'><b>Biddy</b></font>)</div>echoed Biddy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now let me go up and look at my old little room, and rest there a few
minutes by myself. And then, when I have eaten and drunk with you, go
with me as far as the finger-post, dear Joe and Biddy, before we say
good-bye!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>***

<p/>I sold all I had, and put aside as much as I could, for a composition
with my creditors,--who gave me ample time to pay them in full,--and I
went out and joined Herbert. Within a month, I had quitted England,
and within two months I was clerk to Clarriker and Co., and within four
months I assumed my first undivided responsibility. For the beam across
the parlor ceiling at Mill Pond Bank had then ceased to tremble under
old Bill Barley's growls and was at peace, and Herbert had gone away to
marry Clara, and I was left in sole charge of the Eastern Branch until
he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) back.

<p/>Many a year went round before I was a partner in the House; but I lived
happily with Herbert and his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) wife, and lived frugally, and paid my
debts, and maintained a constant correspondence with Biddy and Joe. It
was not until I became third in the Firm, that Clarriker betrayed me to
Herbert; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) then declared that the secret of Herbert's partnership
had been long enough upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) conscience, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) must tell it. So he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>)
told it, and Herbert was as much moved as amazed, and the dear fellow
and I were not the worse friends for the long concealment. I must not
leave it to be supposed that we were ever a great House, or that we made
mints of money. We were not in a grand way of business, but we had a
good name, and worked for our profits, and did very well. We owed so
much to Herbert's ever cheerful industry and readiness, that I often
wondered how I had conceived that old idea of his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) inaptitude, until I
was one day enlightened by the reflection, that perhaps the inaptitude
had never been in him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) at all, but had been in me.




<p/>Chapter LIX

<p/>For eleven years, I had not seen Joe nor Biddy with my bodily
eyes,--though they had both been often before my fancy in the
East,--when, upon an evening in December, an hour or two after dark, I
laid my hand softly on the latch of the old kitchen door. I touched it
so softly that I was not heard, and looked in unseen. There, smoking his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>)
pipe in the old place by the kitchen firelight, as hale and as strong as
ever, though a little gray, sat Joe; and there, fenced into the corner
with Joe's leg, and sitting on my own little stool looking at the fire,
was--I again!

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We giv' him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) the name of Pip for your sake, dear old chap,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>said Joe,
delighted, when I took another stool by the child's side -LRB-but I did not
rumple his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) hair-RRB-, <div class="bookquote">``and we hoped he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) might grow a little bit like you, and
we think he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I thought so too, and I took him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) out for a walk next morning, and we
talked immensely, understanding one another to perfection. And I took
him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) down to the churchyard, and set him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) on a certain tombstone there,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) showed me from that elevation which stone was sacred to the
memory of Philip Pirrip, late of this Parish, and Also Georgiana, Wife
of the Above.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Biddy,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, when I talked with her (<font color='blue'><b>Wife</b></font>) after dinner, as her (<font color='blue'><b>Wife</b></font>) little girl
lay sleeping in her (<font color='blue'><b>Wife</b></font>) lap, <div class="bookquote">``you must give Pip to me one of these days; or
lend him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), at all events.''

 (<font color='red'><b>girl</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no,''  (<font color='red'><b>Biddy</b></font>)</div>said Biddy, gently. <div class="bookquote">``You must marry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So Herbert and Clara say, but I don't think I shall, Biddy. I have so
settled down in their home, that it's not at all likely. I am already
quite an old bachelor.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Biddy</b></font>)</div><p/>Biddy looked down at her (<font color='blue'><b>Wife</b></font>) child, and put its little hand to her (<font color='blue'><b>Wife</b></font>) lips, and
then put the good matronly hand with which she (<font color='blue'><b>Wife</b></font>) had touched it into mine.
There was something in the action, and in the light pressure of Biddy's
wedding-ring, that had a very pretty eloquence in it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear Pip,''  (<font color='red'><b>Biddy</b></font>)</div>said Biddy, <div class="bookquote">``you are sure you don't fret for her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Biddy</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``O no,--I think not, Biddy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Tell me as an old, old friend. Have you quite forgotten her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>)?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear Biddy, I have forgotten nothing in my life that ever had a
foremost place there, and little that ever had any place there. But that
poor dream, as I once used to call it, has all gone by, Biddy,--all gone
by!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Nevertheless, I knew, while I said those words, that I secretly intended
to revisit the site of the old house that evening, alone, for her (<font color='blue'><b>Wife</b></font>) sake.
Yes, even so. For Estella's sake.

<p/>I had heard of her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) as leading a most unhappy life, and as being
separated from her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) husband, who had used her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) with great cruelty, and who
had become quite renowned as a compound of pride, avarice, brutality,
and meanness. And I had heard of the death of her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) husband, from an
accident consequent on his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) ill-treatment of a horse. This release had
befallen her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) some two years before; for anything I knew, she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) was married
again.

<p/>The early dinner hour at Joe's, left me abundance of time, without
hurrying my talk with Biddy, to walk over to the old spot before dark.
But, what with loitering on the way to look at old objects and to think
of old times, the day had quite declined when I came to the place.

<p/>There was no house now, no brewery, no building whatever left, but the
wall of the old garden. The cleared space had been enclosed with a rough
fence, and looking over it, I saw that some of the old ivy had struck
root anew, and was growing green on low quiet mounds of ruin. A gate in
the fence standing ajar, I pushed it open, and went in.

<p/>A cold silvery mist had veiled the afternoon, and the moon was not yet
up to scatter it. But, the stars were shining beyond the mist, and the
moon was coming, and the evening was not dark. I could trace out where
every part of the old house had been, and where the brewery had been,
and where the gates, and where the casks. I had done so, and was looking
along the desolate garden walk, when I beheld a solitary figure in it.

<p/>The figure showed itself aware of me, as I advanced. It had been moving
towards me, but it stood still. As I drew nearer, I saw it to be the
figure of a woman. As I drew nearer yet, it was about to turn away, when
it stopped, and let me come up with it. Then, it faltered, as if much
surprised, and uttered my name, and I cried out,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Estella!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am greatly changed. I wonder you know me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The freshness of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) beauty was indeed gone, but its indescribable
majesty and its indescribable charm remained. Those attractions in it,
I had seen before; what I had never seen before, was the saddened,
softened light of the once proud eyes; what I had never felt before was
the friendly touch of the once insensible hand.

<p/>We sat down on a bench that was near, and I said, <div class="bookquote">``After so many years,
it is strange that we should thus meet again, Estella, here where our
first meeting was! Do you often come back?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have never been here since.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nor I.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>The moon began to rise, and I thought of the placid look at the white
ceiling, which had passed away. The moon began to rise, and I thought of
the pressure on my hand when I had spoken the last words he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) had heard on
earth.

<p/>Estella was the next to break the silence that ensued between us.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have very often hoped and intended to come back, but have been
prevented by many circumstances. Poor, poor old place!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The silvery mist was touched with the first rays of the moonlight, and
the same rays touched the tears that dropped from her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) eyes. Not knowing
that I saw them, and setting herself to get the better of them, she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) said
quietly,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Were you wondering, as you walked along, how it came to be left in this
condition?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Estella.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The ground belongs to me. It is the only possession I have not
relinquished. Everything else has gone from me, little by little, but I
have kept this. It was the subject of the only determined resistance I
made in all the wretched years.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it to be built on?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``At last, it is. I came here to take leave of it before its change. And
you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) said, in a voice of touching interest to a wanderer,--<div class="bookquote">``you
live abroad still?''

 (<font color='red'><b>a wanderer</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Still.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And do well, I am sure?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I work pretty hard for a sufficient living, and therefore--yes, I do
well.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have often thought of you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Estella/Miss Estella/ESTELLA</b></font>)</div>said Estella.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of late, very often. There was a long hard time when I kept far from me
the remembrance of what I had thrown away when I was quite ignorant
of its worth. But since my duty has not been incompatible with the
admission of that remembrance, I have given it a place in my heart.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You have always held your place in my heart,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I answered.

<p/>And we were silent again until she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) spoke.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I little thought,''  (<font color='red'><b>Estella/Miss Estella/ESTELLA</b></font>)</div>said Estella, <div class="bookquote">``that I should take leave of you in
taking leave of this spot. I am very glad to do so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Estella/Miss Estella/ESTELLA</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Glad to part again, Estella? To me, parting is a painful thing. To me,
the remembrance of our last parting has been ever mournful and painful.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you said to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Estella/Miss Estella/ESTELLA</b></font>)</div>returned Estella, very earnestly, ```God bless you,
God forgive you!' And if you could say that to me then, you will not
hesitate to say that to me now,--now, when suffering has been stronger
than all other teaching, and has taught me to understand what your heart
used to be. I have been bent and broken, but--I hope--into a better
shape. Be as considerate and good to me as you were, and tell me we are
friends.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We are friends,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, rising and bending over her (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>), as she (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) rose from
the bench.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And will continue friends apart,''  (<font color='red'><b>Estella/Miss Estella/ESTELLA</b></font>)</div>said Estella.

<p/>I took her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) hand in mine, and we went out of the ruined place; and, as
the morning mists had risen long ago when I first left the forge, so the
evening mists were rising now, and in all the broad expanse of tranquil
light they showed to me, I saw no shadow of another parting from her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>).
