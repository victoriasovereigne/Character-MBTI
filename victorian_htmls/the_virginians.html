<p/>THE VIRGINIANS




<p/>CHAPTER I. In which one of the Virginians visits home


<p/>On the library wall of one of the most famous writers of America, there
hang two crossed swords, which his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) relatives wore in the great War of
Independence. The one sword was gallantly drawn in the service of
the king, the other was the weapon of a brave and honoured republican
soldier. The possessor of the harmless trophy has earned for himself a
name alike honoured in his (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) ancestors' country and his (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) own, where genius
such as his (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) has always a peaceful welcome.

<p/>The ensuing history reminds me of yonder swords in the historian's study
at Boston. In the Revolutionary War, the subjects of this story, natives
of America, and children of the Old Dominion, found themselves engaged
on different sides in the quarrel, coming together peaceably at its
conclusion, as brethren should, their love ever having materially
diminished, however angrily the contest divided them. The colonel in
scarlet, and the general in blue and buff, hang side by side in the
wainscoted parlour of the Warringtons, in England, where a descendant
of one of the brothers has shown their portraits to me, with many of
the letters which they wrote, and the books and papers which belonged
to them. In the Warrington family, and to distinguish them from other
personages of that respectable race, these effigies have always gone
by the name of <div class="bookquote">``The Virginians'' (<font color='red'><b>personages</b></font>)</div>; by which name their memoirs are
christened.

<p/>They both of them passed much time in Europe. They lived just on the
verge of that Old World from which we are drifting away so swiftly. They
were familiar with many varieties of men and fortune. Their lot brought
them into contact with personages of whom we read only in books, who
seem alive, as I read in the Virginians' letters regarding them, whose
voices I almost fancy I hear, as I read the yellow pages written scores
of years since, blotted with the boyish tears of disappointed passion,
dutifully despatched after famous balls and ceremonies of the grand Old
World, scribbled by camp-fires, or out of prison; nay, there is one that
has a bullet through it, and of which a greater portion of the text is
blotted out with the blood of the bearer.

<p/>These letters had probably never been preserved, but for the
affectionate thrift of one person, to whom they never failed in their
dutiful correspondence. Their mother kept all her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) sons' letters, from
the very first, in which Henry, the younger of the twins, sends his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)
love to his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) brother, then ill of a sprain at his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) grandfather's house of
Castlewood, in Virginia, and thanks his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) grandpapa for a horse which he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)
rides with his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) tutor, down to the last, <div class="bookquote">``from my beloved son,''  (<font color='red'><b>tutor</b></font>)</div>which
reached her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) but a few hours before her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) death. The venerable lady never
visited Europe, save once with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) parents in the reign of George the
Second; took refuge in Richmond when the house of Castlewood was burned
down during the war; and was called Madam Esmond ever after that event;
never caring much for the name or family of Warrington, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) held
in very slight estimation as compared to her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) own.

<p/>The letters of the Virginians, as the reader will presently see, from
specimens to be shown to him (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>), are by no means full. They are hints
rather than descriptions--indications and outlines chiefly: it may be,
that the present writer has mistaken the forms, and filled in the colour
wrongly: but, poring over the documents, I have tried to imagine the
situation of the writer, where he (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) was, and by what persons surrounded. I
have drawn the figures as I fancied they were; set down conversations
as I think I might have heard them; and so, to the best of my ability,
endeavoured to revivify the bygone times and people. With what success
the task has been accomplished, with what profit or amusement to
himself, the kind reader will please to determine.

<p/>One summer morning in the year 1756, and in the reign of his (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) Majesty
King George the Second, the Young Rachel, Virginian ship, Edward Franks
master, came up the Avon river on her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) happy return from her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) annual
voyage to the Potomac. She (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) proceeded to Bristol with the tide, and
moored in the stream as near as possible to Trail's wharf, to which she (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>)
was consigned. Mr. Trail, her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) part owner, who could survey his (<font color='blue'><b>Trail</b></font>) ship from
his (<font color='blue'><b>Trail</b></font>) counting-house windows, straightway took boat and came up her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) side.
The owner of the Young Rachel, a large grave man in his (<font color='blue'><b>Young</b></font>) own hair, and of
a demure aspect, gave the hand of welcome to Captain Franks, who stood
on his (<font color='blue'><b>Franks</b></font>) deck, and congratulated the captain upon the speedy and fortunate
voyage which he (<font color='blue'><b>Franks</b></font>) had made. And, remarking that we ought to be thankful
to Heaven for its mercies, he (<font color='blue'><b>Franks</b></font>) proceeded presently to business by asking
particulars relative to cargo and passengers.

<p/>Franks was a pleasant man, who loved a joke. <div class="bookquote">``We have,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>says he (<font color='blue'><b>Franks</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``but
yonder ugly negro boy, who is fetching the trunks, and a passenger who
has the state cabin to himself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Trail looked as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Franks</b></font>) would have preferred more mercies from Heaven.
<div class="bookquote">``Confound you, Franks, and your luck! The Duke William, which came in
last week, brought fourteen, and she (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) is not half of our tonnage.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And this passenger, who has the whole cabin, don't pay nothin',''
 (<font color='red'><b>the Captain</b></font>)</div>continued the Captain. <div class="bookquote">``Swear now, it will do you good, Mr. Trail,
indeed it will. I have tried the medicine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A passenger take the whole cabin and not pay? Gracious mercy, are you a
fool, Captain Franks?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ask the passenger himself, for here he (<font color='blue'><b>Franks</b></font>) comes.''  (<font color='red'><b>the master</b></font>)</div>And, as the master
spoke, a young man of some nineteen years of age came up the hatchway.
He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had a cloak and a sword under his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) arm, and was dressed in deep
mourning, and called out, <div class="bookquote">``Gumbo, you idiot, why don't you fetch the
baggage out of the cabin? Well, shipmate, our journey is ended. You will
see all the little folks to-night whom you have been talking about. Give
my love to Polly, and Betty, and Little Tommy; not forgetting my duty to
Mrs. Franks. I thought, yesterday, the voyage would never be done, and
now I am almost sorry it is over. That little berth in my cabin looks
very comfortable now I am going to leave it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Trail scowled at the young passenger who had paid no money for
his (<font color='blue'><b>Trail</b></font>) passage. He (<font color='blue'><b>Trail</b></font>) scarcely nodded his (<font color='blue'><b>Trail</b></font>) head to the stranger, when Captain
Franks said, <div class="bookquote">``This here gentleman is Mr. Trail, sir, whose name you have
a-heerd of.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Franks/Mr. Franks</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's pretty well known in Bristol, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Trail, majestically.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And this is Mr. Warrington, Madam Esmond Warrington's son, of
Castlewood,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Captain</b></font>)</div>continued the Captain.

<p/>The British merchant's hat was instantly off his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) head, and the owner of
the beaver was making a prodigious number of bows as if a crown prince
were before him (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Gracious powers, Mr. Warrington! This is a delight, indeed! What a
crowning mercy that your voyage should have been so prosperous! You must
have my boat to go on shore. Let me cordially and respectfully welcome
you to England: let me shake your hand as the son of my benefactress and
patroness, Mrs. Esmond Warrington, whose name is known and honoured on
Bristol `Change, I warrant you. Isn't it, Franks?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There's no sweeter tobacco comes from Virginia, and no better brand
than the Three Castles,''  (<font color='red'><b>Franks/Mr. Franks</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Franks, drawing a great brass
tobacco-box from his (<font color='blue'><b>Franks</b></font>) pocket, and thrusting a quid into his (<font color='blue'><b>Franks</b></font>) jolly mouth.
<div class="bookquote">``You don't know what a comfort it is, sir! you'll take to it, bless you,
as you grow older. Won't he (<font color='blue'><b>Franks</b></font>), Mr. Trail? I wish you had ten shiploads of
it instead of one. You might have ten shiploads: I've told Madam Esmond
so; I've rode over her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) plantation; she (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) treats me like a lord when I go
to the house; she (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) don't grudge me the best of wine, or keep me cooling
my heels in the counting-room as some folks does''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>-LRB-with a look at Mr.
Trail-RRB-. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) is a real born lady, she (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) is; and might have a thousand
hogsheads as easy as her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) hundreds, if there were but hands enough.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have lately engaged in the Guinea trade, and could supply her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>)
ladyship with any number of healthy young negroes before next fall,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Trail</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Trail, obsequiously.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We are averse to the purchase of negroes from Africa,''  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>said the young
gentleman, coldly. <div class="bookquote">``My grandfather and my mother have always objected to
it, and I do not like to think of selling or buying the poor wretches.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is for their good, my dear young sir! for their temporal and their
spiritual good!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>cried Mr. Trail. <div class="bookquote">``And we purchase the poor creatures
only for their benefit; let me talk this matter over with you at my own
house. I can introduce you to a happy home, a Christian family, and a
British merchant's honest fare. Can't I, Captain Franks?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Can't say,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Captain</b></font>)</div>growled the Captain. <div class="bookquote">``Never asked me to take bite or sup at
your table. Asked me to psalm-singing once, and to hear Mr. Ward preach:
don't care for them sort of entertainments.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Trail</b></font>)</div><p/>Not choosing to take any notice of this remark, Mr. Trail continued in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Trail</b></font>) low tone: <div class="bookquote">``Business is business, my dear young sir, and I know,
`tis only my duty, the duty of all of us, to cultivate the fruits of the
earth in their season. As the heir of Lady Esmond's estate--for I speak,
I believe, to the heir of that great property?--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Trail</b></font>)</div><p/>The young gentleman made a bow.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``--I would urge upon you, at the very earliest moment, the propriety,
the duty of increasing the ample means with which Heaven has blessed
you. As an honest factor, I could not do otherwise; as a prudent man,
should I scruple to speak of what will tend to your profit and mine? No,
my dear Mr. George.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My name is not George; my name is Henry,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man eyes</b></font>)</div>said the young man as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
turned his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head away, and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes filled with tears.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Gracious powers! what do you mean, sir? Did you not say you were my
lady's heir? and is not George Esmond Warrington, Esq.--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hold your tongue, you fool!''  (<font color='red'><b>Franks/Mr. Franks</b></font>)</div>cried Mr. Franks, striking the merchant a
tough blow on his (<font color='blue'><b>merchant</b></font>) sleek sides, as the young lad turned away. <div class="bookquote">``Don't
you see the young gentleman a-swabbing his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) eyes, and note his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) black
clothes?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you mean, Captain Franks, by laying your hand on your owners?
Mr. George is the heir; I know the Colonel's will well enough.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. George is there,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Captain</b></font>)</div>said the Captain, pointing with his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) thumb to the
deck.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>cries the factor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. George is there!''  (<font color='red'><b>the Captain</b></font>)</div>reiterated the Captain, again lifting up his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>)
finger towards the topmast, or the sky beyond. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) is dead a year, sir,
come next 9th of July. He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) would go out with General Braddock on that
dreadful business to the Belle Riviere. He (<font color='blue'><b>Braddock</b></font>) and a thousand more never
came back again. Every man of them was murdered as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fell. You know
the Indian way, Mr. Trail?''  (<font color='red'><b>the Captain</b></font>)</div>And here the Captain passed his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) hand rapidly
round his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) head. ``Horrible! ain't it, sir? horrible! He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was a fine young
man, the very picture of this one; only his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hair was black, which is now
hanging in a bloody Indian wigwam. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was often and often on board of
the Young Rachel, and would have his (<font color='blue'><b>Young</b></font>) chests of books broke open on deck
before they was landed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Young</b></font>) was a shy and silent young gent: not like
this one, which was the merriest, wildest young fellow, full of his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)
songs and fun. He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) took on dreadful at the news; went to his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) bed, had
that fever which lays so many of `em by the heels along that swampy
Potomac, but he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)'s got better on the voyage: the voyage makes every one
better; and, in course, the young gentleman can't be for ever a-crying
after a brother who dies and leaves him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) a great fortune. Ever since we
sighted Ireland he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) has been quite gay and happy, only he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) would go off at
times, when he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) was most merry, saying, `I wish my dearest Georgy
could enjoy this here sight along with me, and when you mentioned
the t'other's name, you see, he (<font color='blue'><b>Georgy</b></font>) couldn't stand it.''' And the honest
Captain's own eyes filled with tears, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) turned and looked towards
the object of his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) compassion.

<p/>Mr. Trail assumed a lugubrious countenance befitting the tragic
compliment with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) prepared to greet the young Virginian; but the
latter answered him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) very curtly, declined his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) offers of hospitality, and
only stayed in Mr. Trail's house long enough to drink a glass of wine
and to take up a sum of money of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) stood in need. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) and
Captain Franks parted on the very warmest terms, and all the little crew
of the Young Rachel cheered from the ship's side as their passenger left
it.

<p/>Again and again Harry Warrington and his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) brother had pored over the
English map, and determined upon the course which they should take
upon arriving at Home. All Americans who love the old country--and what
gently-nurtured man or woman of Anglo-Saxon race does not?--have ere
this rehearsed their English travels, and visited in fancy the spots
with which their hopes, their parents' fond stories, their friends'
descriptions, have rendered them familiar. There are few things to me
more affecting in the history of the quarrel which divided the two great
nations than the recurrence of that word Home, as used by the younger
towards the elder country. Harry Warrington had his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) chart laid out.
Before London, and its glorious temples of St. Paul's and St. Peter's;
its grim Tower, where the brave and loyal had shed their blood, from
Wallace down to Balmerino and Kilmarnock, pitied by gentle hearts;
before the awful window of Whitehall, whence the martyr Charles
had issued, to kneel once more, and then ascend to Heaven;--before
Playhouses, Parks, and Palaces, wondrous resorts of wit, pleasure, and
splendour;--before Shakspeare's Resting-place under the tall spire which
rises by Avon, amidst the sweet Warwickshire pastures;--before Derby,
and Falkirk, and Culloden, where the cause of honour and loyalty had
fallen, it might be to rise no more:--before all these points of their
pilgrimage there was one which the young Virginian brothers held even
more sacred, and that was the home of their family,--that old Castlewood
in Hampshire, about which their parents had talked so fondly. From
Bristol to Bath, from Bath to Salisbury, to Winchester, to Hexton, to
Home; they knew the way, and had mapped the journey many and many a
time.

<p/>We must fancy our American traveller to be a handsome young fellow,
whose suit of sables only made him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) look the more interesting. The plump
landlady from her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) bar, surrounded by her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) china and punch-bowls, and
stout gilded bottles of strong waters, and glittering rows of silver
flagons, looked kindly after the young gentleman as he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) passed through
the inn-hall from his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) post-chaise, and the obsequious chamberlain bowed
him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) upstairs to the Rose or the Dolphin. The trim chambermaid dropped
her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) best curtsey for his (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>) fee, and Gumbo, in the inn-kitchen, where the
townsfolk drank their mug of ale by the great fire, bragged of his (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>) young
master's splendid house in Virginia, and of the immense wealth to which
he (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>) was heir. The postchaise whirled the traveller through the most
delightful home-scenery his (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>) eyes had ever lighted on. If English
landscape is pleasant to the American of the present day, who must needs
contrast the rich woods and glowing pastures, and picturesque ancient
villages of the old country with the rough aspect of his (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>) own, how much
pleasanter must Harry Warrington's course have been, whose journeys had
lain through swamps and forest solitudes from one Virginian ordinary
to another log-house at the end of the day's route, and who now lighted
suddenly upon the busy, happy, splendid scene of English summer? And the
highroad, a hundred years ago, was not that grass-grown desert of the
present time. It was alive with constant travel and traffic: the country
towns and inns swarmed with life and gaiety. The ponderous waggon, with
its bells and plodding team; the light post-coach that achieved the
journey from the White Hart, Salisbury, to the Swan with Two Necks,
London, in two days; the strings of packhorses that had not yet left the
road; my lord's gilt postchaise-and-six, with the outriders galloping
on ahead; the country squire's great coach and heavy Flanders mares; the
farmers trotting to market, or the parson jolting to the cathedral town
on Dumpling, his (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) wife behind on the pillion--all these crowding sights
and brisk people greeted the young traveller on his (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) summer journey.
Hodge, the farmer's boy, took off his (<font color='blue'><b>Hodge</b></font>) hat, and Polly, the milkmaid,
bobbed a curtsey, as the chaise whirled over the pleasant village-green,
and the white-headed children lifted their chubby faces and cheered.
The church-spires glistened with gold, the cottage-gables glared in
sunshine, the great elms murmured in summer, or cast purple shadows over
the grass. Young Warrington never had such a glorious day, or witnessed
a scene so delightful. To be nineteen years of age, with high health,
high spirits, and a full purse, to be making your first journey, and
rolling through the country in a postchaise at nine miles an hour--O
happy youth! almost it makes one young to think of him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>)! But Harry was
too eager to give more than a passing glance at the Abbey at Bath,
or gaze with more than a moment's wonder at the mighty Minster at
Salisbury. Until he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) beheld Home it seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had no eyes for any
other place.

<p/>At last the young gentleman's postchaise drew up at the rustic inn on
Castlewood Green, of which his (<font color='blue'><b>Green</b></font>) grandsire had many a time talked to him (<font color='blue'><b>Green</b></font>),
and which bears as its ensign, swinging from an elm near the inn porch,
the Three Castles of the Esmond family. They had a sign, too, over the
gateway of Castlewood House, bearing the same cognisance. This was the
hatchment of Francis, Lord Castlewood, who now lay in the chapel hard
by, his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) son reigning in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) stead.

<p/>Harry Warrington had often heard of Francis, Lord Castlewood. It was
for Frank's sake, and for his (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) great love towards the boy, that Colonel
Esmond determined to forgo his (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) claim to the English estates and rank of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) family, and retired to Virginia. The young man had led a wild youth;
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had fought with distinction under Marlborough; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had married a
foreign lady, and most lamentably adopted her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) religion. At one time he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
had been a Jacobite -LRB-for loyalty to the sovereign was ever hereditary
in the Esmond family-RRB-, but had received some slight or injury from the
Prince, which had caused him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) to rally to King George's side. He (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) had,
on his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) second marriage, renounced the errors of Popery which he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) had
temporarily embraced, and returned to the Established Church again. He (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>)
had, from his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) constant support of the King and the Minister of the time
being, been rewarded by his (<font color='blue'><b>Minister</b></font>) Majesty George II., and died an English
peer. An earl's coronet now figured on the hatchment which hung over
Castlewood gate--and there was an end of the jolly gentleman. Between
Colonel Esmond, who had become his (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) stepfather, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) lordship there
had ever been a brief but affectionate correspondence--on the Colonel's
part especially, who loved his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) stepson, and had a hundred stories to
tell about him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) grandchildren. Madam Esmond, however, said she (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>)
could see nothing in her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) half-brother. He (<font color='blue'><b>half-brother</b></font>) was dull, except when he (<font color='blue'><b>half-brother</b></font>) drank
too much wine, and that, to be sure, was every day at dinner. Then
he (<font color='blue'><b>half-brother</b></font>) was boisterous, and his (<font color='blue'><b>half-brother</b></font>) conversation not pleasant. He (<font color='blue'><b>half-brother</b></font>) was
good-looking--yes--a fine tall stout animal; she (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) had rather her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) boys
should follow a different model. In spite of the grandfather's encomium
of the late lord, the boys had no very great respect for their kinsman's
memory. The lads and their mother were staunch Jacobites, though having
every respect for his (<font color='blue'><b>kinsman</b></font>) present Majesty; but right was right, and nothing
could make their hearts swerve from their allegiance to the descendants
of the martyr Charles.

<p/>With a beating heart Harry Warrington walked from the inn towards
the house where his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) grandsire's youth had been passed. The little
village-green of Castlewood slopes down towards the river, which is
spanned by an old bridge of a single broad arch, and from this the
ground rises gradually towards the house, grey with many gables and
buttresses, and backed by a darkling wood. An old man sate at the wicket
on a stone bench in front of the great arched entrance to the house,
over which the earl's hatchment was hanging. An old dog was crouched at
the man's feet. Immediately above the ancient sentry at the gate was an
open casement with some homely flowers in the window, from behind which
good-humoured girls' faces were peeping. They were watching the young
traveller dressed in black as he (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) walked up gazing towards the castle,
and the ebony attendant who followed the gentleman's steps also
accoutred in mourning. So was he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) at the gate in mourning, and the girls
when they came out had black ribbons.

<p/>To Harry's surprise, the old man accosted him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) by his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) name. <div class="bookquote">``You have had
a nice ride to Hexton, Master Harry, and the sorrel carried you well.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think you must be Lockwood,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>said Harry, with rather a tremulous
voice, holding out his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hand to the old man. His (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) grandfather had often
told him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) of Lockwood, and how he (<font color='blue'><b>Lockwood</b></font>) had accompanied the Colonel and the
young Viscount in Marlborough's wars forty years ago. The veteran seemed
puzzled by the mark of affection which Harry extended to him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). The old
dog gazed at the new-comer, and then went and put his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) head between his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
knees. <div class="bookquote">``I have heard of you often. How did you know my name?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They say I forget most things,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>says the old man, with a smile; <div class="bookquote">``but
I ain't so bad as that quite. Only this mornin', when you went out, my
darter says, `Father, do you know why you have a black coat on?' `In
course I know why I have a black coat,' says I. `My lord is dead. They
say `twas a foul blow, and Master Frank is my lord now, and Master
Harry'--why, what have you done since you've went out this morning? Why,
you have a-grow'd taller and changed your hair--though I know--I know
you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/>One of the young women had tripped out by this time from the porter's
lodge, and dropped the stranger a pretty curtsey. <div class="bookquote">``Grandfather sometimes
does not recollect very well,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said, pointing to her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``Your
honour seems to have heard of Lockwood?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you, have you never heard of Colonel Francis Esmond?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) was Captain and Major in Webb's Foot, and I was with him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) in two
campaigns, sure enough,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lockwood</b></font>)</div>cries Lockwood. <div class="bookquote">``Wasn't I, Ponto?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The Colonel as married Viscountess Rachel, my late lord's mother? and
went to live amongst the Indians? We have heard of him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>). Sure we have his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>)
picture in our gallery, and hisself painted it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Went to live in Virginia, and died there seven years ago, and I am his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>)
grandson.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Lord, your honour! Why, your honour's skin's as white as mine,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Molly/Molly</b></font>)</div>cries
Molly. <div class="bookquote">``Grandfather, do you hear this? His (<font color='blue'><b>Grandfather</b></font>) honour is Colonel Esmond's
grandson that used to send you tobacco, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandfather</b></font>) honour have come all the
way from Virginia.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To see you, Lockwood,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man family</b></font>)</div>says the young man, <div class="bookquote">``and the family. I only set
foot on English ground yesterday, and my first visit is for home. I may
see the house, though the family are from home?''  (<font color='red'><b>the man family</b></font>)</div>Molly dared to say Mrs.
Barker would let his (<font color='blue'><b>Lockwood</b></font>) honour see the house, and Harry Warrington made
his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) way across the court, seeming to know the place as well as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) had
been born there, Miss Molly thought, who followed, accompanied by Mr.
Gumbo making her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) a profusion of polite bows and speeches.




<p/>CHAPTER II. In which Harry has to pay for his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) Supper


<p/>Colonel Esmond's grandson rang for a while at his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) ancestors' house of
Castlewood, before any one within seemed inclined to notice his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) summons.
The servant, who at length issued from the door, seemed to be very
little affected by the announcement that the visitor was a relation of
the family. The family was away, and in their absence John cared very
little for their relatives, but was eager to get back to his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) game at
cards with Thomas in the window-seat. The housekeeper was busy getting
ready for my lord and my lady, who were expected that evening. Only by
strong entreaties could Harry gain leave to see my lady's sitting-room
and the picture-room, where, sure enough, was a portrait of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
grandfather in periwig and breastplate, the counterpart of their picture
in Virginia, and a likeness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) grandmother, as Lady Castlewood, in a
yet earlier habit of Charles II.'s time; her (<font color='blue'><b>Castlewood</b></font>) neck bare, her (<font color='blue'><b>Castlewood</b></font>) fair golden
hair waving over her (<font color='blue'><b>Castlewood</b></font>) shoulders in ringlets which he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) remembered to have
seen snowy white. From the contemplation of these sights the sulky
housekeeper drove him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>). Her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) family was about to arrive. There was my lady
the Countess, and my lord and his (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) brother, and the young ladies, and the
Baroness, who was to have the state bedroom. Who was the Baroness? The
Baroness Bernstein, the young ladies' aunt. Harry wrote down his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) name
on a paper from his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) own pocket-book, and laid it on a table in the hall.
<div class="bookquote">``Henry Esmond Warrington, of Castlewood, in Virginia, arrived in England
yesterday--staying at the Three Castles in the village.''  (<font color='red'><b>The lackeys</b></font>)</div>The lackeys
rose up from their cards to open the door to him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), in order to get their
<div class="bookquote">``wails,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>and Gumbo quitted the bench at the gate, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had been
talking with old Lockwood, the porter, who took Harry's guinea, hardly
knowing the meaning of the gift. During the visit to the home of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
fathers, Harry had only seen little Polly's countenance that was
the least unselfish or kindly: he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) walked away, not caring to own how
disappointed he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was, and what a damp had been struck upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) by the
aspect of the place. They ought to have known him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). Had any of them
ridden up to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) house in Virginia, whether the master were present or
absent, the guests would have been made welcome, and, in sight of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
ancestors' hall, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had to go and ask for a dish of bacon and eggs at a
country alehouse!

<p/>After his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) dinner, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) went to the bridge and sate on it, looking towards
the old house, behind which the sun was descending as the rooks came
cawing home to their nests in the elms. His (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) young fancy pictured to
itself many of the ancestors of whom his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) mother and grandsire had told
him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) fancied knights and huntsmen crossing the ford;--cavaliers
of King Charles's days; my Lord Castlewood, his (<font color='blue'><b>Castlewood</b></font>) grandmother's first
husband, riding out with hawk and hound. The recollection of his (<font color='blue'><b>Castlewood</b></font>) dearest
lost brother came back to him (<font color='blue'><b>Castlewood</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Castlewood</b></font>) indulged in these reveries, and
smote him (<font color='blue'><b>Castlewood</b></font>) with a pang of exceeding tenderness and longing, insomuch that
the young man hung his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head and felt his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sorrow renewed for the dear
friend and companion with whom, until of late, all his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pleasures and
griefs had been shared. As he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sate plunged in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own thoughts, which
were mingled up with the mechanical clinking of the blacksmith's forge
hard by, the noises of the evening, the talk of the rooks, and the
calling of the birds round about--a couple of young men on horseback
dashed over the bridge. One of them, with an oath, called him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) a fool,
and told him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to keep out of the way--the other, who fancied he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) might
have jostled the foot-passenger, and possibly might have sent him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) over
the parapet, pushed on more quickly when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) reached the other side of
the water, calling likewise to Tom to come on; and the pair of young
gentlemen were up the hill on their way to the house before Harry had
recovered himself from his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) surprise at their appearance, and wrath at
their behaviour. In a minute or two, this advanced guard was followed by
two livery servants on horseback, who scowled at the young traveller
on the bridge a true British welcome of Curse you, who are you? After
these, in a minute or two, came a coach-and-six, a ponderous vehicle
having need of the horses which drew it, and containing three ladies, a
couple of maids, and an armed man on a seat behind the carriage. Three
handsome pale faces looked out at Harry Warrington as the carriage
passed over the bridge, and did not return the salute which, recognising
the family arms, he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) gave it. The gentleman behind the carriage glared at
him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) haughtily. Harry felt terribly alone. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) would go back to
Captain Franks. The Rachel and her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) little tossing cabin seemed a cheery
spot in comparison to that on which he (<font color='blue'><b>Franks</b></font>) stood. The inn-folks did not know
his (<font color='blue'><b>Franks</b></font>) name of Warrington. They told him (<font color='blue'><b>Franks</b></font>) that was my lady in the coach,
with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) stepdaughter, my Lady Maria, and her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) daughter, my Lady Fanny;
and the young gentleman in the grey frock was Mr. William, and he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) with
powder on the chestnut was my lord. It was the latter had sworn the
loudest, and called him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) a fool; and it was the grey frock which had
nearly galloped Harry into the ditch.

<p/>The landlord of the Three Castles had shown Harry a bedchamber, but
he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had refused to have his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) portmanteaux unpacked, thinking that, for a
certainty, the folks of the great house would invite him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) to theirs. One,
two, three hours passed, and there came no invitation. Harry was fain
to have his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) trunks open at last, and to call for his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) slippers and
gown. Just before dark, about two hours after the arrival of the first
carriage, a second chariot with four horses had passed over the bridge,
and a stout, high-coloured lady, with a very dark pair of eyes, had
looked hard at Mr. Warrington. That was the Baroness Bernstein, the
landlady said, my lord's aunt, and Harry remembered the first Lady
Castlewood had come of a German family. Earl, and Countess, and
Baroness, and postillions, and gentlemen, and horses, had all
disappeared behind the castle gate, and Harry was fain to go to bed at
last, in the most melancholy mood and with a cruel sense of neglect and
loneliness in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) young heart. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could not sleep, and, besides, ere
long, heard a prodigious noise, and cursing, and giggling, and screaming
from my landlady's bar, which would have served to keep him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) awake.

<p/>Then Gumbo's voice was heard without, remonstrating, <div class="bookquote">``You cannot go in,
sar--my master asleep, sar!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>but a shrill voice, with many oaths,
which Harry Warrington recognised, cursed Gumbo for a stupid, negro
woolly-pate, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) was pushed aside, giving entrance to a flood of
oaths into the room, and a young gentleman behind them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Beg your pardon, Cousin Warrington,''  (<font color='red'><b>the blasphemer</b></font>)</div>cried the young blasphemer, <div class="bookquote">``are
you asleep? Beg your pardon for riding you over on the bridge. Didn't
know you--course shouldn't have done it--thought it was a lawyer with a
writ--dressed in black, you know. Gad! thought it was Nathan come to nab
me.''  (<font color='red'><b>the blasphemer</b></font>)</div>And Mr. William laughed incoherently. It was evident that he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) was
excited with liquor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You did me great honour to mistake me for a sheriff's-officer, cousin,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>says Harry, with great gravity, sitting up in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) tall nightcap.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Gad! I thought it was Nathan, and was going to send you souse into the
river. But I ask your pardon. You see I had been drinking at the Bell at
Hexton, and the punch is good at the Bell at Hexton. Hullo! you, Davis!
a bowl of punch; d’you hear?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have had my share for to-night, cousin, and I should think you have,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>Harry continues, always in the dignified style.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You want me to go, Cousin What's-your-name, I see,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. William/William/William Esmond</b></font>)</div>Mr. William said,
with gravity. <div class="bookquote">``You want me to go, and they want me to come, and I didn't
want to come. I said, I'd see him (<font color='blue'><b>Cousin</b></font>) hanged first,--that's what I said. Why
should I trouble myself to come down all alone of an evening, and look
after a fellow I don't care a pin for? Zackly what I said. Zackly what
Castlewood said. Why the devil should he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) go down? Castlewood says,
and so said my lady, but the Baroness would have you. It's all the
Baroness's doing, and if she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) says a thing, it must be done; so you must
just get up and come.''  (<font color='red'><b>Henry/Henry Esmond/Mr. Henry Warrington</b></font>)</div>Mr. Esmond delivered these words with the most
amiable rapidity and indistinctness, running them into one another, and
tacking about the room as he (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) spoke. But the young Virginian was in
great wrath. <div class="bookquote">``I tell you what, cousin,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Virginian</b></font>) cried, <div class="bookquote">``I won't move for the
Countess, or for the Baroness, or for all the cousins in Castlewood.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And when the landlord entered the chamber with the bowl of punch, which
Mr. Esmond had ordered, the young gentleman in bed called out fiercely
to the host, to turn that sot out of the room.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sot, you little tobacconist! Sot, you Cherokee!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. William/William/William Esmond</b></font>)</div>screams out Mr.
William. <div class="bookquote">``Jump out of bed, and I'll drive my sword through your body.
Why didn't I do it to-day when I took you for a bailiff--a confounded
pettifogging bum-bailiff!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) went on screeching more oaths and
incoherencies, until the landlord, the drawer, the hostler, and all the
folks of the kitchen were brought to lead him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) away. After which Harry
Warrington closed his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) tent round him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) in sulky wrath, and, no doubt,
finally went fast to sleep.


<p/>My landlord was very much more obsequious on the next morning when he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>)
met his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) young guest, having now fully learned his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) name and quality.
Other messengers had come from the castle on the previous night to bring
both the young gentlemen home, and poor Mr. William, it appeared, had
returned in a wheelbarrow, being not altogether unaccustomed to that
mode of conveyance. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>bailiff</b></font>) never remembers nothin' about it the next day.
He (<font color='blue'><b>bailiff</b></font>) is of a real kind nature, Mr. William,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>the landlord vowed, <div class="bookquote">``and
the men get crowns and half-crowns from him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) by saying that he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) beat them
overnight when he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) was in liquor. He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>)'s the devil when he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>)'s tipsy,
Mr. William, but when he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) is sober he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) is the very kindest of young
gentlemen.''

 (<font color='red'><b>writers</b></font>)</div><p/>As nothing is unknown to writers of biographies of the present kind, it
may be as well to state what had occurred within the walls of Castlewood
House, whilst Harry Warrington was without, awaiting some token of
recognition from his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) kinsmen. On their arrival at home the family
had found the paper on which the lad's name was inscribed, and his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>)
appearance occasioned a little domestic council. My Lord Castlewood
supposed that must have been the young gentleman whom they had seen on
the bridge, and as they had not drowned him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) they must invite him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>). Let a
man go down with the proper messages, let a servant carry a note. Lady
Fanny thought it would be more civil if one of the brothers would go to
their kinsman, especially considering the original greeting which
they had given. Lord Castlewood had not the slightest objection to his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>)
brother William going--yes, William should go. Upon this Mr. William
said -LRB-with a yet stronger expression-RRB- that he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) would be hanged if he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>)
would go. Lady Maria thought the young gentleman whom they had remarked
at the bridge was a pretty fellow enough. Castlewood is dreadfully dull,
I am sure neither of my brothers do anything to make it amusing. He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) may
be vulgar--no doubt, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) is vulgar--but let us see the American. Such was
Lady Maria's opinion. Lady Castlewood was neither for inviting nor for
refusing him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>), but for delaying. <div class="bookquote">``Wait till your aunt comes, children;
perhaps the Baroness won't like to see the young man; at least, let us
consult her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) before we ask him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>kinsfolk</b></font>)</div>And so the hospitality to be offered by
his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) nearest kinsfolk to poor Harry Warrington remained yet in abeyance.

<p/>At length the equipage of the Baroness Bernstein made its appearance,
and whatever doubt there might be as to the reception of the Virginian
stranger, there was no lack of enthusiasm in this generous family
regarding their wealthy and powerful kinswoman. The state-chamber had
already been prepared for her (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>). The cook had arrived the previous day
with instructions to get ready a supper for her (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>) such as her (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>) ladyship
liked. The table sparkled with old plate, and was set in the oak
dining-room with the pictures of the family round the walls. There was
the late Viscount, his (<font color='blue'><b>Viscount</b></font>) father, his (<font color='blue'><b>Viscount</b></font>) mother, his (<font color='blue'><b>Viscount</b></font>) sister--these two lovely
pictures. There was his (<font color='blue'><b>Viscount</b></font>) predecessor by Vandyck, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Viscount</b></font>) Viscountess.
There was Colonel Esmond, their relative in Virginia, about whose
grandson the ladies and gentlemen of the Esmond family showed such a
very moderate degree of sympathy.

<p/>The feast set before their aunt, the Baroness, was a very good one,
and her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) ladyship enjoyed it. The supper occupied an hour or two, during
which the whole Castlewood family were most attentive to their guest.
The Countess pressed all the good dishes upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>), of which she (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) freely
partook: the butler no sooner saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) glass empty than he (<font color='blue'><b>butler</b></font>) filled it with
champagne: the young folks and their mother kept up the conversation,
not so much by talking, as by listening appropriately to their friend.
She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was full of spirits and humour. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) seemed to know everybody in
Europe, and about those everybodies the wickedest stories. The Countess
of Castlewood, ordinarily a very demure, severe woman, and a stickler
for the proprieties, smiled at the very worst of these anecdotes; the
girls looked at one another and laughed at the maternal signal; the boys
giggled and roared with especial delight at their sisters' confusion.
They also partook freely of the wine which the butler handed round, nor
did they, or their guest, disdain the bowl of smoking punch, which was
laid on the table after the supper. Many and many a night, the Baroness
said, she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) had drunk at that table by her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) father's side. <div class="bookquote">``That was his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
place,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) pointed to the place where the Countess now sat. She (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) saw
none of the old plate. That was all melted to pay his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) gambling debts.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) hoped, <div class="bookquote">``Young gentlemen, that you don't play.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never, on my word,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>says Castlewood.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Never, `pon honour,''  (<font color='red'><b>brother</b></font>)</div>says Will--winking at his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) brother.

<p/>The Baroness was very glad to hear they were such good boys. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) face
grew redder with the punch; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) became voluble, might have been
thought coarse, but that times were different, and those critics were
inclined to be especially favourable.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) talked to the boys about their father, their grandfather--other men
and women of the house. <div class="bookquote">``The only man of the family was that,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) said,
pointing -LRB-with an arm that was yet beautifully round and white-RRB- towards
the picture of the military gentleman in the red coat and cuirass, and
great black periwig.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The Virginian? What is he (<font color='blue'><b>Virginian</b></font>) good for? I always thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Virginian</b></font>) was good for
nothing but to cultivate tobacco and my grandmother,''  (<font color='red'><b>lord</b></font>)</div>says my lord,
laughing.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) struck her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) hand upon the table with an energy that made the glasses
dance. <div class="bookquote">``I say he (<font color='blue'><b>Virginian</b></font>) was the best of you all. There never was one of the
male Esmonds that had more brains than a goose, except him (<font color='blue'><b>Virginian</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Virginian</b></font>) was not
fit for this wicked, selfish old world of ours, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Virginian</b></font>) was right to go
and live out of it. Where would your father have been, young people, but
for him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Was he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) particularly kind to our papa?''  (<font color='red'><b>Maria/Lady Maria/Lady Maria Esmond</b></font>)</div>says Lady Maria.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Old stories, my dear Maria!''  (<font color='red'><b>the Countess</b></font>)</div>cries the Countess. <div class="bookquote">``I am sure my dear
Earl was very kind to him (<font color='blue'><b>Earl</b></font>) in giving him (<font color='blue'><b>Earl</b></font>) that great estate in Virginia.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Since his (<font color='blue'><b>Earl</b></font>) brother's death, the lad who has been here to-day is heir to
that. Mr. Draper told me so! Peste! I don't know why my father gave up
such a property.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who has been here to-day?''  (<font color='red'><b>Baroness/Baroness Bernstein/Bernstein</b></font>)</div>asked the Baroness, highly excited.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Harry Esmond Warrington, of Virginia,''  (<font color='red'><b>lord lad</b></font>)</div>my lord answered: <div class="bookquote">``a lad whom
Will nearly pitched into the river, and whom I pressed my lady the
Countess to invite to stay here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>lord lad</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You mean that one of the Virginian boys has been to Castlewood, and has
not been asked to stay here?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There is but one of them, my dear creature,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Earl</b></font>)</div>interposes the Earl. <div class="bookquote">``The
other, you know, has just been--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``For shame, for shame!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! it ain't pleasant, I confess, to be se--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you mean that a grandson of Henry Esmond, the master of this house,
has been here, and none of you have offered him (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) hospitality?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Since we didn't know it, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) is staying at the Castles?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>interposes
Will.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That he (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) is staying at the Inn, and you are sitting there!''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>cries the
old lady. <div class="bookquote">``This is too bad--call somebody to me. Get me my hood--I'll go
to the boy myself. Come with me this instant, my Lord Castlewood.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div><p/>The young man rose up, evidently in wrath. <div class="bookquote">``Madame the Baroness of
Bernstein,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``your ladyship is welcome to go; but as for me, I
don't choose to have such words as `shameful' applied to my conduct. I
won't go and fetch the young gentleman from Virginia, and I propose to
sit here and finish this bowl of punch. Eugene! Don't Eugene me, madam.
I know her (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>) ladyship has a great deal of money, which you are desirous
should remain in our amiable family. You want it more than I do. Cringe
for it--I won't.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sank back in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) chair.

<p/>The Baroness looked at the family, who held their heads down, and then
at my lord, but this time without any dislike. She (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) leaned over to him (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>)
and said rapidly in German, <div class="bookquote">``I had unright when I said the Colonel was
the only man of the family. Thou canst, if thou willest, Eugene.''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>To
which remark my lord only bowed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you do not wish an old woman to go out at this hour of the night,
let William, at least, go and fetch his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) cousin,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Baroness</b></font>)</div>said the Baroness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The very thing I proposed to him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And so did we--and so did we!''  (<font color='red'><b>the daughters</b></font>)</div>cried the daughters in a breath.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sure, I only wanted the dear Baroness's consent!''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>said their
mother, <div class="bookquote">``and shall be charmed for my part to welcome our young
relative.''

 (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Will! Put on thy pattens and get a lantern, and go fetch the
Virginian,''  (<font color='red'><b>lord</b></font>)</div>said my lord.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And we will have another bowl of punch when he (<font color='blue'><b>Virginian</b></font>) comes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. William/William/William Esmond</b></font>)</div>says William,
who by this time had already had too much. And he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) went forth--how we
have seen; and how he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) had more punch; and how ill he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) succeeded in his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>)
embassy.

<p/>The worthy lady of Castlewood, as she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) caught sight of young Harry
Warrington by the river-side, must have seen a very handsome and
interesting youth, and very likely had reasons of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) own for not
desiring his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) presence in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) family. All mothers are not eager to
encourage the visits of interesting youths of nineteen in families where
there are virgins of twenty. If Harry's acres had been in Norfolk or
Devon, in place of Virginia, no doubt the good Countess would have been
rather more eager in her (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) welcome. Had she (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) wanted him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) would have
given him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) hand readily enough. If our people of ton are selfish, at
any rate they show they are selfish; and, being cold-hearted, at least
have no hypocrisy of affection.

<p/>Why should Lady Castlewood put herself out of the way to welcome the
young stranger? Because he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) was friendless? Only a simpleton could ever
imagine such a reason as that. People of fashion, like her (<font color='blue'><b>Castlewood</b></font>) ladyship, are
friendly to those who have plenty of friends. A poor lad, alone, from a
distant country, with only very moderate means, and those not as yet in
his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) own power, with uncouth manners very likely, and coarse provincial
habits; was a great lady called upon to put herself out of the way for
such a youth? Allons donc! He (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) was quite as well at the alehouse as at
the castle.

<p/>This, no doubt, was her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) ladyship's opinion, which her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) kinswoman, the
Baroness Bernstein, who knew her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) perfectly well, entirely understood.
The Baroness, too, was a woman of the world, and, possibly, on occasion,
could be as selfish as any other person of fashion. She (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) fully understood
the cause of the deference which all the Castlewood family showed to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>)--mother, and daughter, and sons,--and being a woman of great humour,
played upon the dispositions of the various members of this family,
amused herself with their greedinesses, their humiliations, their
artless respect for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) money-box, and clinging attachment to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) purse.
They were not very rich; Lady Castlewood's own money was settled on
her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) children. The two elder had inherited nothing but flaxen heads from
their German mother, and a pedigree of prodigious distinction. But
those who had money, and those who had none, were alike eager for the
Baroness's; in this matter the rich are surely quite as greedy as the
poor.

<p/>So if Madam Bernstein struck her (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>) hand on the table, and caused the
glasses and the persons round it to tremble at her (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>) wrath, it was because
she (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>) was excited with plenty of punch and champagne, which her (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>) ladyship
was in the habit of taking freely, and because she (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>) may have had a
generous impulse when generous wine warmed her (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>) blood, and felt indignant
as she (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>) thought of the poor lad yonder, sitting friendless and lonely on
the outside of his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) ancestors' door; not because she (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>) was specially angry
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>) relatives, who she (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>) knew would act precisely as they had done.

<p/>The exhibition of their selfishness and humiliation alike amused her (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>),
as did Castlewood's act of revolt. He (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) was as selfish as the rest of the
family, but not so mean; and, as he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) candidly stated, he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) could afford the
luxury of a little independence, having tolerable estate to fall back
upon.

<p/>Madam Bernstein was an early woman, restless, resolute, extraordinarily
active for her (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>) age. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>) was up long before the languid Castlewood
ladies -LRB-just home from their London routs and balls-RRB- had quitted their
feather-beds, or jolly Will had slept off his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) various potations of
punch. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>) was up, and pacing the green terraces that sparkled with the
sweet morning dew, which lay twinkling, also, on a flowery wilderness
of trim parterres, and on the crisp walls of the dark box hedges, under
which marble fauns and dryads were cooling themselves, whilst a thousand
birds sang, the fountains plashed and glittered in the rosy morning
sunshine, and the rooks cawed from the great wood.

<p/>Had the well-remembered scene -LRB-for she (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>) had visited it often in
childhood-RRB- a freshness and charm for her (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>)? Did it recall days of
innocence and happiness, and did its calm beauty soothe or please,
or awaken remorse in her (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>) heart? Her (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>) manner was more than ordinarily
affectionate and gentle, when, presently, after pacing the walks for a
half-hour, the person for whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>) was waiting came to her (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>). This was our
young Virginian, to whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>) had despatched an early billet by one of
the Lockwoods. The note was signed B. Bernstein, and informed Mr. Esmond
Warrington that his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) relatives at Castlewood, and among them a dear
friend of his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) grandfather, were most anxious that he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) should come to
<div class="bookquote">``Colonel Esmond's house in England.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And now, accordingly, the lad made
his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) appearance, passing under the old Gothic doorway, tripping down the
steps from one garden terrace to another, hat in hand, his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) fair hair
blowing from his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) flushed cheeks, his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) slim figure clad in mourning. The
handsome and modest looks, the comely face and person, of the young lad
pleased the lady. He (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) made her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) a low bow which would have done credit
to Versailles. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) held out a little hand to him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>), and, as his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) own palm
closed over it, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) laid the other hand softly on his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) ruffle. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) looked
very kindly and affectionately in the honest blushing face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I knew your grandfather very well, Harry,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``So you came
yesterday to see his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) picture, and they turned you away, though you know
the house was his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) of right?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry blushed very red. <div class="bookquote">``The servants did not know me. A young gentleman
came to me last night,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``when I was peevish, and he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>), I fear,
was tipsy. I spoke rudely to my cousin, and would ask his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) pardon.
Your ladyship knows that in Virginia our manners towards strangers are
different. I own I had expected another kind of welcome. Was it you,
madam, who sent my cousin to me last night?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I sent him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>); but you will find your cousins most friendly to you to-day.
You must stay here. Lord Castlewood would have been with you this
morning, only I was so eager to see you. There will be breakfast in
an hour; and meantime you must talk to me. We will send to the Three
Castles for your servant and your baggage. Give me your arm. Stop, I
dropped my cane when you came. You shall be my cane.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My grandfather used to call us his (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) crutches,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>said Harry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are like him (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>), though you are fair.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You should have seen--you should have seen George,''  (<font color='red'><b>the boy eyes</b></font>)</div>said the boy, and
his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) honest eyes welled with tears. The recollection of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) brother,
the bitter pain of yesterday's humiliation, the affectionateness of the
present greeting--all, perhaps, contributed to soften the lad's heart.
He (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) felt very tenderly and gratefully towards the lady who had received
him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) so warmly. He (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) was utterly alone and miserable a minute since, and
here was a home and a kind hand held out to him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>). No wonder he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) clung to
it. In the hour during which they talked together, the young fellow
had poured out a great deal of his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) honest heart to the kind new-found
friend; when the dial told breakfast-time, he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) wondered to think how much
he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) had told her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) took him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) to the breakfast-room; she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) presented
him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) aunt, the Countess, and bade him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) embrace his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) cousins. Lord
Castlewood was frank and gracious enough. Honest Will had a headache,
but was utterly unconscious of the proceedings of the past night. The
ladies were very pleasant and polite, as ladies of their fashion know
how to be. How should Harry Warrington, a simple truth-telling lad
from a distant colony, who had only yesterday put his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) foot upon English
shore, know that my ladies, so smiling and easy in demeanour, were
furious against him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>), and aghast at the favour with which Madam Bernstein
seemed to regard him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>)?

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>) was folle of him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>), talked of no one else, scarce noticed the
Castlewood young people, trotted with him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) over the house, and told him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>)
all its story, showed him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) the little room in the courtyard where his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>)
grandfather used to sleep, and a cunning cupboard over the fireplace
which had been made in the time of the Catholic persecutions; drove out
with him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) in the neighbouring country, and pointed out to him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) the most
remarkable sites and houses, and had in return the whole of the young
man's story.

<p/>This brief biography the kind reader will please to accept, not in
the precise words in which Mr. Harry Warrington delivered it to Madam
Bernstein, but in the form in which it has been cast in the Chapters
next ensuing.




<p/>CHAPTER III. The Esmonds in Virginia


<p/>Henry Esmond, Esq., an office who had served with the rank of Colonel
during the wars of Queen Anne's reign, found himself, at its close,
compromised in certain attempts for the restoration of the Queen's
family to the throne of these realms. Happily for itself, the nation
preferred another dynasty; but some of the few opponents of the house
of Hanover took refuge out of the three kingdoms, and amongst others,
Colonel Esmond was counselled by his (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) friends to go abroad. As Mr. Esmond
sincerely regretted the part which he (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) had taken, and as the august
Prince who came to rule over England was the most pacable of sovereigns,
in a very little time the Colonel's friends found means to make his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>)
peace.

<p/>Mr. Esmond, it has been said, belonged to the noble English family which
takes its title from Castlewood, in the county of Hants; and it was
pretty generally known that King James II. and his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) son had offered the
title of Marquis to Colonel Esmond and his (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) father, and that the former
might have assumed the -LRB-Irish-RRB- peerage hereditary in his (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) family, but
for an informality which he (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) did not choose to set right. Tired of the
political struggles in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) had been engaged, and annoyed by family
circumstances in Europe, he (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) preferred to establish himself in Virginia,
where he (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) took possession of a large estate conferred by King Charles I.
upon his (<font color='blue'><b>I.</b></font>) ancestor. Here Mr. Esmond's daughter and grandsons were born,
and his (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) wife died. This lady, when she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) married him (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>), was the widow of the
Colonel's kinsman, the unlucky Viscount Castlewood, killed in a duel by
Lord Mohun, at the close of King William's reign.

<p/>Mr. Esmond called his (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) American house Castlewood, from the patrimonial
home in the old country. The whole usages of Virginia, indeed, were
fondly modelled after the English customs. It was a loyal colony. The
Virginians boasted that King Charles II. had been king in Virginia
before he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) had been king in England. English king and English church were
alike faithfully honoured there. The resident gentry were allied to good
English families. They held their heads above the Dutch traders of New
York, and the money-getting Roundheads of Pennsylvania and New England.
Never were people less republican than those of the great province which
was soon to be foremost in the memorable revolt against the British
Crown.

<p/>The gentry of Virginia dwelt on their great lands after a fashion almost
patriarchal. For its rough cultivation, each estate had a multitude
of hands--of purchased and assigned servants--who were subject to the
command of the master. The land yielded their food, live stock, and
game. The great rivers swarmed with fish for the taking. From their
banks the passage home was clear. Their ships took the tobacco off their
private wharves on the banks of the Potomac or the James river, and
carried it to London or Bristol,--bringing back English goods and
articles of home manufacture in return for the only produce which the
Virginian gentry chose to cultivate. Their hospitality was boundless.
No stranger was ever sent away from their gates. The gentry received one
another, and travelled to each other's houses, in a state almost feudal.
The question of Slavery was not born at the time of which we write. To
be the proprietor of black servants shocked the feelings of no Virginian
gentleman; nor, in truth, was the despotism exercised over the negro
race generally a savage one. The food was plenty; the poor black people
lazy and not unhappy. You might have preached negro emancipation to
Madam Esmond of Castlewood as you might have told her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) to let the horses
run loose out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) stables; she (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) had no doubt but that the whip and the
corn-bag were good for both.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) father may have thought otherwise, being of a sceptical turn on very
many points, but his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) doubts did not break forth in active denial, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was rather disaffected than rebellious. At one period, this gentleman
had taken a part in active life at home, and possibly might have been
eager to share its rewards; but in latter days he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) did not seem to care
for them. A something had occurred in his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) life, which had cast a tinge
of melancholy over all his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) existence. He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was not unhappy--to those about
him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) most kind--most affectionate, obsequious even to the women of
his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) family, whom be scarce ever contradicted; but there had been some
bankruptcy of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) heart, which his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) spirit never recovered. He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) submitted
to life, rather than enjoyed it, and never was in better spirits than in
his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) last hours when he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was going to lay it down.

<p/>Having lost his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) wife, his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) daughter took the management of the Colonel
and his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) affairs; and he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) gave them up to her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) charge with an entire
acquiescence. So that he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) books and his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) quiet, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) cared for no
more. When company came to Castlewood, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) entertained them handsomely,
and was of a very pleasant, sarcastical turn. He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was not in the least
sorry when they went away.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My love, I shall not be sorry to go myself,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) said to his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) daughter,
<div class="bookquote">``and you, though the most affectionate of daughters, will console
yourself after a while. Why should I, who am so old, be romantic? You
may, who are still a young creature.''  (<font color='red'><b>daughter</b></font>)</div>This he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) said, not meaning all he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
said, for the lady whom he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) addressed was a matter-of-fact little person,
with very little romance in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) nature.

<p/>After fifteen years' residence upon his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) great Virginian estate, affairs
prospered so well with the worthy proprietor, that he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) acquiesced in his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
daughter's plans for the building of a mansion much grander and more
durable than the plain wooden edifice in which he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had been content to
live, so that his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) heirs might have a habitation worthy of their noble
name. Several of Madam Warrington's neighbours had built handsome houses
for themselves; perhaps it was her (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) ambition to take rank in the country,
which inspired this desire for improved quarters. Colonel Esmond, of
Castlewood, neither cared for quarters nor for quarterings. But his (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>)
daughter had a very high opinion of the merit and antiquity of her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>)
lineage; and her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) sire, growing exquisitely calm and good-natured in his (<font color='blue'><b>sire</b></font>)
serene, declining years, humoured his (<font color='blue'><b>sire</b></font>) child's peculiarities in an easy,
bantering way,--nay, helped her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>sire</b></font>) antiquarian learning, which was
not inconsiderable, and with his (<font color='blue'><b>sire</b></font>) skill in the art of painting, of which
he (<font color='blue'><b>sire</b></font>) was a proficient. A knowledge of heraldry, a hundred years ago,
formed part of the education of most noble ladies and gentlemen: during
her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) visit to Europe, Miss Esmond had eagerly studied the family history
and pedigrees, and returned thence to Virginia with a store of documents
relative to her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) family on which she (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) relied with implicit gravity and
credence, and with the most edifying volumes then published in France
and England, respecting the noble science. These works proved, to her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>)
perfect satisfaction, not only that the Esmonds were descended from
noble Norman warriors, who came into England along with their victorious
chief, but from native English of royal dignity: and two magnificent
heraldic trees, cunningly painted by the hand of the Colonel,
represented the family springing from the Emperor Charlemagne on the
one hand, who was drawn in plate-armour, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Emperor</b></font>) imperial mantle and
diadem, and on the other from Queen Boadicea, whom the Colonel insisted
upon painting in the light costume of an ancient British queen, with
a prodigious gilded crown, a trifling mantle of furs, and a lovely
symmetrical person, tastefully tattooed with figures of a brilliant blue
tint. From these two illustrious stocks the family-tree rose until
it united in the thirteenth century somewhere in the person of the
fortunate Esmond who claimed to spring from both.

<p/>Of the Warrington family, into which she (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) married, good Madam Rachel
thought but little. She (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) wrote herself Esmond Warrington, but was
universally called Madam Esmond of Castlewood, when after her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) father's
decease she (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) came to rule over that domain. It is even to be feared that
quarrels for precedence in the colonial society occasionally disturbed
her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) temper; for though her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) father had had a marquis's patent from King
James, which he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) had burned and disowned, she (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) would frequently act as if
that document existed and was in full force. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) considered the English
Esmonds of an inferior dignity to her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) own branch; and as for the
colonial aristocracy, she (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) made no scruple of asserting her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) superiority
over the whole body of them. Hence quarrels and angry words, and even
a scuffle or two, as we gather from her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) notes, at the Governor's
assemblies at Jamestown. Wherefore recall the memory of these squabbles?
Are not the persons who engaged in them beyond the reach of quarrels
now, and has not the republic put an end to these social inequalities?
Ere the establishment of Independence, there was no more aristocratic
country in the world than Virginia; so the Virginians, whose history
we have to narrate, were bred to have the fullest respect for the
institutions of home, and the rightful king had not two more faithful
little subjects than the young twins of Castlewood.

<p/>When the boys' grandfather died, their mother, in great state,
proclaimed her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) eldest son George her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) successor and heir of the estate;
and Harry, George's younger brother by half an hour, was always enjoined
to respect his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) senior. All the household was equally instructed to pay
him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) honour; the negroes, of whom there was a large and happy family, and
the assigned servants from Europe, whose lot was made as bearable as it
might be under the government of the lady of Castlewood. In the whole
family there scarcely was a rebel save Mrs. Esmond's faithful friend and
companion, Madam Mountain, and Harry's foster-mother, a faithful negro
woman, who never could be made to understand why her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) child should not be
first, who was handsomer, and stronger, and cleverer than his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) brother,
as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) vowed; though, in truth, there was scarcely any difference in the
beauty, strength, or stature of the twins. In disposition, they were in
many points exceedingly unlike; but in feature they resembled each other
so closely, that but for the colour of their hair it had been difficult
to distinguish them. In their beds, and when their heads were covered
with those vast ribboned nightcaps which our great and little ancestors
wore, it was scarcely possible for any but a nurse or mother to tell the
one from the other child.

<p/>Howbeit alike in form, we have said that they differed in temper. The
elder was peaceful, studious, and silent; the younger was warlike
and noisy. He (<font color='blue'><b>our</b></font>) was quick at learning when he (<font color='blue'><b>our</b></font>) began, but very slow at
beginning. No threats of the ferule would provoke Harry to learn in
an idle fit, or would prevent George from helping his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) brother in his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
lesson. Harry was of a strong military turn, drilled the little
negroes on the estate and caned them like a corporal, having many
good boxing-matches with them, and never bearing malice if he (<font color='blue'><b>corporal</b></font>) was
worsted;--whereas George was sparing of blows and gentle with all about
him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>). As the custom in all families was, each of the boys had a special
little servant assigned him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>); and it was a known fact that George,
finding his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) little wretch of a blackamoor asleep on his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) master's bed,
sat down beside it and brushed the flies off the child with a feather
fan, to the horror of old Gumbo, the child's father, who found his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) young
master so engaged, and to the indignation of Madam Esmond, who ordered
the young negro off to the proper officer for a whipping. In vain George
implored and entreated--burst into passionate tears, and besought a
remission of the sentence. His (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) mother was inflexible regarding the young
rebel's punishment, and the little negro went off beseeching his (<font color='blue'><b>negro</b></font>) young
master not to cry.

<p/>A fierce quarrel between mother and son ensued out of this event. Her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
son would not be pacified. He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) said the punishment was a shame--a shame;
that he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) was the master of the boy, and no one--no, not his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) mother,--had
a right to touch him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>); that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) might order him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) to be corrected, and that
he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) would suffer the punishment, as he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) and Harry often had, but no
one should lay a hand on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) boy. Trembling with passionate rebellion
against what he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) conceived the injustice of procedure, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) vowed--actually
shrieking out an oath, which shocked his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) fond mother and governor, who
never before heard such language from the usually gentle child--that on
the day he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) came of age he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) would set young Gumbo free--went to visit the
child in the slaves' quarters, and gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) own toys.

<p/>The young black martyr was an impudent, lazy, saucy little personage,
who would be none the worse for a whipping, as the Colonel no doubt
thought; for he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) acquiesced in the child's punishment when Madam Esmond
insisted upon it, and only laughed in his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) good-natured way when his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>)
indignant grandson called out,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You let mamma rule you in everything, grandpapa.''

 (<font color='red'><b>grandson</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, so I do,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>says grandpapa. <div class="bookquote">``Rachel, my love, the way in which I am
petticoat-ridden is so evident that even this baby has found it out.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then why don't you stand up like a man?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>says little Harry', who always
was ready to abet his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) brother.

<p/>Grandpapa looked queerly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Because I like sitting down best, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I am an old
gentleman, and standing fatigues me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the lad</b></font>)</div><p/>On account of a certain apish drollery and humour which exhibited itself
in the lad, and a liking for some of the old man's pursuits, the first
of the twins was the grandfather's favourite and companion, and would
laugh and talk out all his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) infantine heart to the old gentleman, to whom
the younger had seldom a word to say. George was a demure studious boy,
and his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) senses seemed to brighten up in the library, where his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) brother
was so gloomy. He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) knew the books before he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) could well-nigh carry them,
and read in them long before he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) could understand them. Harry, on the
other hand, was all alive in the stables or in the wood, eager for all
parties of hunting and fishing, and promised to be a good sportsman from
a very early age. Their grandfather's ship was sailing for Europe once
when the boys were children, and they were asked, what present Captain
Franks should bring them back? George was divided between books and a
fiddle; Harry instantly declared for a little gun: and Madam Warrington
-LRB-as she (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) then was called-RRB- was hurt that her (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) elder boy should have low
tastes, and applauded the younger's choice as more worthy of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) name
and lineage. <div class="bookquote">``Books, papa, I can fancy to be a good choice,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) replied
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) father, who tried to convince her (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) that George had a right to his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
opinion, <div class="bookquote">``though I am sure you must have pretty nigh all the books in
the world already. But I never can desire--I may be wrong, but I never
can desire--that my son, and the grandson of the Marquis of Esmond,
should be a fiddler.''

 (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Should be a fiddlestick, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Colonel</b></font>)</div>the old Colonel answered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Remember that Heaven's ways are not ours, and that each creature born
has a little kingdom of thought of his (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) own, which it is a sin in us to
invade. Suppose George loves music? You can no more stop him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) than you
can order a rose not to smell sweet, or a bird not to sing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A bird! A bird sings from nature; George did not come into the world
with a fiddle in his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) hand,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Warrington/Mrs. Esmond/Mrs. Esmond Warrington</b></font>)</div>says Mrs. Warrington, with a toss of her (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>)
head. <div class="bookquote">``I am sure I hated the harpsichord when a chit at Kensington
School, and only learned it to please my mamma. Say what you will,
dear sir, I can not believe that this fiddling is work for persons of
fashion.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And King David who played the harp, my dear?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish my papa would read him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) more, and not speak about him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) in that
way,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Warrington/Mrs. Esmond/Mrs. Esmond Warrington</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Warrington.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, my dear, it was but by way of illustration,''  (<font color='red'><b>the father</b></font>)</div>the father replied
gently. It was Colonel Esmond's nature, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) has owned in his (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) own
biography, always to be led by a woman; and, his (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) wife dead, he (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) coaxed
and dandled and spoiled his (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) daughter; laughing at her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) caprices, but
humouring them; making a joke of her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) prejudices, but letting them have
their way; indulging, and perhaps increasing, her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) natural imperiousness
of character, though it was his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) maxim that we can't change dispositions
by meddling, and only make hypocrites of our children by commanding them
over-much.

<p/>At length the time came when Mr. Esmond was to have done with the
affairs of this life, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) laid them down as if glad to be rid of
their burthen. We must not ring in an opening history with tolling
bells, or preface it with a funeral sermon. All who read and heard
that discourse, wondered where Parson Broadbent of Jamestown found the
eloquence and the Latin which adorned it. Perhaps Mr. Dempster knew, the
boys' Scotch tutor, who corrected the proofs of the oration, which was
printed, by desire of his (<font color='blue'><b>Dempster</b></font>) Excellency and many persons of honour, at Mr.
Franklin's press in Philadelphia. No such sumptuous funeral had ever
been seen in the country as that which Madam Esmond Warrington ordained
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) father, who would have been the first to smile at that pompous
grief. The little lads of Castlewood, almost smothered in black trains
and hatbands, headed the procession, and were followed by my Lord
Fairfax from Greenway Court, by his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) Excellency the Governor of Virginia
-LRB-with his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) coach-RRB-, by the Randolphs, the Careys, the Harrisons, the
Washingtons, and many others, for the whole county esteemed the departed
gentleman, whose goodness, whose high talents, whose benevolence
and unobtrusive urbanity had earned for him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) the just respect of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
neighbours. When informed of the event, the family of Colonel Esmond's
stepson, the Lord Castlewood of Hampshire in England, asked to be at the
charges of the marble slab which recorded the names and virtues of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>)
lordship's mother and her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) husband; and after due time of preparation,
the monument was set up, exhibiting the arms and coronet of the Esmonds,
supported by a little chubby group of weeping cherubs, and reciting an
epitaph which for once did not tell any falsehoods.




<p/>CHAPTER IV. In which Harry finds a New Relative


<p/>Kind friends, neighbours hospitable, cordial, even respectful,--an
ancient name, a large estate and a sufficient fortune, a comfortable
home, supplied with all the necessaries and many of the luxuries
of life, and a troop of servants, black and white, eager to do your
bidding; good health, affectionate children, and, let us humbly add, a
good cook, cellar, and library--ought not a person in the possession of
all these benefits to be considered very decently happy? Madam Esmond
Warrington possessed all these causes for happiness; she (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) reminded
herself of them daily in her (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) morning and evening prayers. She (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) was
scrupulous in her (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) devotions, good to the poor, never knowingly did
anybody a wrong. Yonder I fancy her (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) enthroned in her (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) principality of
Castlewood, the country gentlefolks paying her (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) court, the sons dutiful
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>), the domestics tumbling over each other's black heels to do her (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>)
bidding, the poor whites grateful for her (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) bounty and implicitly taking
her (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) doses when they were ill, the smaller gentry always acquiescing in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) remarks, and for ever letting her (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) win at backgammon--well, with all
these benefits, which are more sure than fate allots to most mortals, I
don't think the little Princess Pocahontas, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Pocahontas</b></font>) was called, was to
be envied in the midst of her (<font color='blue'><b>Pocahontas</b></font>) dominions. The Princess's husband, who
was cut off in early life, was as well perhaps out of the way. Had
he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) survived his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) marriage by many years, they would have quarrelled
fiercely, or, he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) would infallibly have been a henpecked husband, of
which sort there were a few specimens still extant a hundred years ago.
The truth is, little Madam Esmond never came near man or woman, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>)
tried to domineer over them. If people obeyed, she (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) was their very good
friend; if they resisted, she (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) fought and fought until she (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) or they gave
in. We are all miserable sinners that's a fact we acknowledge in public
every Sunday--no one announced it in a more clear resolute voice than
the little lady. As a mortal, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) may have been in the wrong, of course;
only she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) very seldom acknowledged the circumstance to herself, and to
others never. Her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) father, in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) old age, used to watch her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) freaks of
despotism, haughtiness, and stubbornness, and amuse himself with them.
She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) felt that his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) eye was upon her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>); his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) humour, of which quality she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
possessed little herself, subdued and bewildered her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>). But, the Colonel
gone, there was nobody else whom she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was disposed to obey,--and so I
am rather glad for my part that I did not live a hundred years ago at
Castlewood in Westmorland County in Virginia. I fancy, one would not
have been too happy there. Happy, who is happy? Was not there a serpent
in Paradise itself? and if Eve had been perfectly happy beforehand,
would she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) have listened to him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>)?

<p/>The management of the house of Castlewood had been in the hands of the
active little lady long before the Colonel slept the sleep of the just.
She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) now exercised a rigid supervision over the estate; dismissed
Colonel Esmond's English factor and employed a new one; built, improved,
planted, grew tobacco, appointed a new overseer, and imported a new
tutor. Much as she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) loved her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) father, there were some of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) maxims by
which she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was not inclined to abide. Had she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) not obeyed her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) papa and
mamma during all their lives, as a dutiful daughter should? So ought
all children to obey their parents, that their days might be long in
the land. The little Queen domineered over her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) little dominion, and the
Princes her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) sons were only her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) first subjects. Ere long she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) discontinued
her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) husband's name of Warrington and went by the name of Madam Esmond
in the country. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) family pretensions were known there. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) had no
objection to talk of the Marquis's title which King James had given to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) father and grandfather. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) papa's enormous magnanimity might induce
him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) to give up his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) titles and rank to the younger branch of the family,
and to her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) half-brother, my Lord Castlewood and his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) children; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>)
and her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) sons were of the elder branch of the Esmonds, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) expected
that they should be treated accordingly. Lord Fairfax was the only
gentleman in the colony of Virginia to whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) would allow precedence
over her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) insisted on the pas before all Lieutenant-Governors' and
Judges' ladies; before the wife of the Governor of a colony she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) would,
of course, yield as to the representative of the Sovereign. Accounts
are extant, in the family papers and letters, of one or two tremendous
battles which Madam fought with the wives of colonial dignitaries upon
these questions of etiquette. As for her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) husband's family of Warrington,
they were as naught in her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) eyes. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) married an English baronet's
younger son out of Norfolk to please her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) parents, whom she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was always
bound to obey. At the early age at which she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) married--a chit out of
a boarding-school--she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) would have jumped overboard if her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) papa had
ordered. <div class="bookquote">``And that is always the way with the Esmonds,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) said.

<p/>The English Warringtons were not over-much flattered by the little
American Princess's behaviour to them, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) manner of speaking about
them. Once a year a solemn letter used to be addressed to the Warrington
family, and to her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) noble kinsmen the Hampshire Esmonds; but a Judge's
lady with whom Madam Esmond had quarrelled returning to England out of
Virginia chanced to meet Lady Warrington, who was in London with
Sir Miles attending Parliament, and this person repeated some of the
speeches which the Princess Pocahontas was in the habit of making
regarding her (<font color='blue'><b>Pocahontas</b></font>) own and her (<font color='blue'><b>Pocahontas</b></font>) husband's English relatives, and my Lady
Warrington, I suppose, carried the story to my Lady Castlewood; after
which the letters from Virginia were not answered, to the surprise and
wrath of Madam Esmond, who speedily left off writing also.

<p/>So this good woman fell out with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) neighbours, with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) relatives,
and, as it must be owned, with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) sons also.

<p/>A very early difference which occurred between the Queen and Crown
Prince arose out of the dismissal of Mr. Dempster, the lad's tutor and
the late Colonel's secretary. In her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) father's life Madam Esmond bore him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
with difficulty, or it should be rather said Mr. Dempster could scarce
put up with her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) was jealous of books somehow, and thought your
bookworms dangerous folks, insinuating bad principles. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) had heard
that Dempster was a Jesuit in disguise, and the poor fellow was obliged
to go build himself a cabin in a clearing, and teach school and practise
medicine where he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) could find customers among the sparse inhabitants of
the province. Master George vowed he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) never would forsake his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) old tutor,
and kept his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) promise. Harry had always loved fishing and sporting better
than books, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) and the poor Dominie had never been on terms of close
intimacy. Another cause of dispute presently ensued.

<p/>By the death of an aunt, and at his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) father's demise, the heir of Mr.
George Warrington became entitled to a sum of six thousand pounds, of
which their mother was one of the trustees. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) never could be made to
understand that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was not the proprietor, and not merely the trustee
of this money; and was furious with the London lawyer, the other
trustee, who refused to send it over at her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) order. <div class="bookquote">``Is not all I have
my sons'?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) cried, <div class="bookquote">``and would I not cut myself into little pieces
to serve them? With the six thousand pounds I would have bought Mr.
Boulter's estate and negroes, which would have given us a good thousand
pounds a year, and made a handsome provision for my Harry.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) young
friend and neighbour, Mr. Washington of Mount Vernon, could not convince
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) that the London agent was right, and must not give up his (<font color='blue'><b>agent</b></font>) trust
except to those for whom he (<font color='blue'><b>agent</b></font>) held it. Madam Esmond gave the London lawyer
a piece of her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) mind, and, I am sorry to say, informed Mr. Draper that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Draper</b></font>) was an insolent pettifogger, and deserved to be punished for
doubting the honour of a mother and an Esmond. It must be owned that the
Virginian Princess had a temper of her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) own.

<p/>George Esmond, her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) firstborn, when this little matter was referred to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>), and his (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) mother vehemently insisted that he (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) should declare himself,
was of the opinion of Mr. Washington, and Mr. Draper, the London lawyer.
The boy said he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) could not help himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) did not want the money: he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
would be very glad to think otherwise, and to give the money to his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
mother, if he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had the power. But Madam Esmond would not hear any of
these reasons. Feelings were her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) reasons. Here was a chance of making
Harry's fortune--dear Harry, who was left with such a slender younger
brother's; pittance--and the wretches in London would not help him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>); his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
own brother, who inherited all her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) papa's estate, would not help him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>).
To think of a child of hers being so mean at fourteen year of age! etc.
etc.. Add tears, scorn, frequent innuendo, long estrangement, bitter
outbreak, passionate appeals to Heaven, and the like, and we may fancy
the widow's state of mind. Are there not beloved beings of the gentler
sex who argue in the same way nowadays? The book of female logic is
blotted all over with tears, and Justice in their courts is for ever in
a passion.

<p/>This occurrence set the widow resolutely saving for her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) younger son,
for whom, as in duty bound, she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) was eager to make a portion. The fine
buildings were stopped which the Colonel had commenced at Castlewood,
who had freighted ships from New York with Dutch bricks, and imported,
at great charges, mantelpieces, carved cornice-work, sashes and glass,
carpets and costly upholstery from home. No more books were bought.
The agent had orders to discontinue sending wine. Madam Esmond deeply
regretted the expense of a fine carriage which she (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) had had from England,
and only rode in it to church groaning in spirit, and crying to the sons
opposite her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``Harry, Harry! I wish I had put by the money for thee, my
poor portionless child--three hundred and eighty guineas of ready money
to Messieurs Hatchett!''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You will give me plenty while you live, and George will give me plenty
when you die,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>says Harry, gaily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not unless he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) changes in spirit, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>says the lady, with a
grim glance at her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) elder boy. <div class="bookquote">``Not unless Heaven softens his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) heart and
teaches him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) charity, for which I pray day and night; as Mountain knows;
do you not, Mountain?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Mountain/Mountain</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Mountain, Ensign Mountain's widow, Madam Esmond's companion and
manager, who took the fourth seat in the family coach on these Sundays,
said, <div class="bookquote">``Humph! I know you are always disturbing yourself and crying out
about this legacy, and I don't see that there is any need.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the family coach</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh no! no need!''  (<font color='red'><b>the widow rustling</b></font>)</div>cries the widow, rustling in her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) silks; <div class="bookquote">``of course I
have no need to be disturbed, because my eldest born is a disobedient
son and an unkind brother--because he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) has an estate, and my poor Harry,
bless him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), but a mess of pottage.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the widow rustling</b></font>)</div><p/>George looked despairingly at his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) mother until he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) could see her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) no more
for eyes welled up with tears. <div class="bookquote">``I wish you would bless me, too, O my
mother!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) said, and burst into a passionate fit of weeping. Harry's
arms were in a moment round his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) brother's neck, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) kissed George a
score of times.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Never mind, George. I know whether you are a good brother or not. Don't
mind what she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) says. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) don't mean it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do mean it, child,''  (<font color='red'><b>the mother</b></font>)</div>cries the mother. Would to Heaven--''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``HOLD YOUR TONGUE, I SAY''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>roars out Harry. <div class="bookquote">``It's a shame to speak so to
him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>), ma’am.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And so it is, Harry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Mountain/Mountain</b></font>)</div>says Mrs. Mountain, shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hand. <div class="bookquote">``You never
said a truer word in your life.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Mountain, do you dare to set my children against me?''  (<font color='red'><b>the widow</b></font>)</div>cries the
widow. <div class="bookquote">``From this very day, madam--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Turn me and my child into the street? Do,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Mountain/Mountain</b></font>)</div>says Mrs. Mountain. <div class="bookquote">``That
will be a fine revenge because the English lawyer won't give you the
boy's money. Find another companion who will tell you black is white,
and flatter you: it is not my way, madam. When shall I go? I shan't be
long a-packing. I did not bring much into Castlewood House, and I shall
not take much out.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hush! the bells are ringing for church, Mountain. Let us try, if you
please, and compose ourselves,''  (<font color='red'><b>the widow</b></font>)</div>said the widow, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mountain</b></font>) looked with eyes
of extreme affection, certainly at one--perhap at both--of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mountain</b></font>) children.
George kept his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) head down, and Harry, who was near, got quite close to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) during the sermon, and sat with his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) arm round his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) brother's neck.


<p/>Harry had proceeded in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) narrative after his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) own fashion,
interspersing it with many youthful ejaculations, and answering a number
of incidental questions asked by his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) listener. The old lady seemed never
tired of hearing him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). Her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) amiable hostess and her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) daughters came more
than once, to ask if she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) would ride, or walk, or take a dish of tea, or
play a game at cards; but all these amusements Madam Bernstein declined,
saying that she (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>) found infinite amusement in Harry's conversation.
Especially when any of the Castlewood family were present, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>) redoubled
her (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>) caresses, insisted upon the lad speaking close to her (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>) ear, and would
call out to the others, <div class="bookquote">``Hush, my dears! I can't hear our cousin speak.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the others</b></font>)</div>And they would quit the room, striving still to look pleased.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you my cousin, too?''  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div>asked the honest boy. <div class="bookquote">``You see kinder than my
other cousins.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the family</b></font>)</div><p/>Their talk took place in the wainscoted parlour, where the family had
taken their meals in ordinary for at least two centuries past, and
which, as we have said, was hung with portraits of the race. Over
Madam Bernstein's great chair was a Kneller, one of the most brilliant
pictures of the gallery, representing a young lady of three or four
and twenty, in the easy flowing dress and loose robes of Queen Anne's
time--a hand on a cushion near her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>), a quantity of auburn hair parted off
a fair forehead, and flowing over pearly shoulders and a lovely neck.
Under this sprightly picture the lady sate with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) knitting-needles.

<p/>When Harry asked, <div class="bookquote">``Are you my cousin, too?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``That picture is
by Sir Godfrey, who thought himself the greatest painter in the world.
But he (<font color='blue'><b>Godfrey</b></font>) was not so good as Lely, who painted your grandmother--my--my
Lady Castlewood, Colonel Esmond's wife; nor he (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) so good as Sir Anthony
Van Dyck, who painted your great-grandfather, yonder--and who looks,
Harry, a much finer gentleman than he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was. Some of us are painted
blacker than we are. Did you recognise your grandmother in that picture?
She (<font color='blue'><b>grandmother</b></font>) had the loveliest fair hair and shape of any woman of her (<font color='blue'><b>grandmother</b></font>) time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I fancied I knew the portrait from instinct, perhaps, and a certain
likeness to my mother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did Mrs. Warrington--I beg her (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) pardon, I think she (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) calls herself Madam
or my Lady Esmond now--?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They call my mother so in our province,''  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div>said the boy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Did she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) never tell you of another daughter her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) mother had in England,

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER V. Family Jars


<p/>As Harry Warrington related to his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) new-found relative the simple story
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) adventures at home, no doubt Madam Bernstein, who possessed a
great sense of humour and a remarkable knowledge of the world, formed
her (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>) judgment respecting the persons and events described; and if her (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>)
opinion was not in all respects favourable, what can be said but that
men and women are imperfect, and human life not entirely pleasant or
profitable? The court and city-bred lady recoiled at the mere thought of
her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) American sister's countrified existence. Such a life would be rather
wearisome to most city-bred ladies. But little Madam Warrington knew no
better, and was satisfied with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) life, as indeed she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was with herself
in general. Because you and I are epicures or dainty feeders, it does
not follow that Hodge is miserable with his (<font color='blue'><b>Hodge</b></font>) homely meal of bread and
bacon. Madam Warrington had a life of duties and employments which might
be humdrum, but at any rate were pleasant to her (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) was a brisk little
woman of business, and all the affairs of her (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) large estate came under
her (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) cognisance. No pie was baked at Castlewood but her (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) little finger was
in it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) set the maids to their spinning, she (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) saw the kitchen wenches
at their work, she (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) trotted afield on her (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) pony, and oversaw the overseers
and the negro hands as they worked in the tobacco-and corn-fields. If a
slave was ill, she (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) would go to his (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) quarters in any weather, and doctor
him (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) with great resolution. She (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) had a book full of receipts after the old
fashion, and a closet where she (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) distilled waters and compounded elixirs,
and a medicine-chest which was the terror of her (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) neighbours. They
trembled to be ill, lest the little lady should be upon them with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
decoctions and her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) pills.

<p/>A hundred years back there were scarce any towns in Virginia; the
establishments of the gentry were little villages in which they
and their vassals dwelt. Rachel Esmond ruled like a little queen in
Castlewood; the princes, her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) neighbours, governed their estates round
about. Many of these were rather needy potentates, living plentifully
but in the roughest fashion, having numerous domestics whose liveries
were often ragged; keeping open houses, and turning away no stranger
from their gates; proud, idle, fond of all sorts of field sports
as became gentlemen of good lineage. The widow of Castlewood was as
hospitable as her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) neighbours, and a better economist than most of
them. More than one, no doubt, would have had no objection to share her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>)
life-interest in the estate, and supply the place of papa to her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) boys.
But where was the man good enough for a person of her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) ladyship's exalted
birth? There was a talk of making the Duke of Cumberland viceroy, or
even king, over America. Madam Warrington's gossips laughed, and said
she (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) was waiting for him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) remarked, with much gravity and dignity,
that persons of as high birth as his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) Royal Highness had made offers of
alliance to the Esmond family.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) had, as lieutenant under her (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>), an officer's widow who has been before
named, and who had been Madam Esmond's companion at school, as her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) late
husband had been the regimental friend of the late Mr. Warrington. When
the English girls at the Kensington Academy, where Rachel Esmond had her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>)
education, teased and tortured the little American stranger, and laughed
at the princified airs which she (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) gave herself from a very early age,
Fanny Parker defended and befriended her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>). They both married ensigns
in Kingsley's. They became tenderly attached to each other. It was <div class="bookquote">``my
Fanny''  (<font color='red'><b>the ladies</b></font>)</div>and <div class="bookquote">``my Rachel''  (<font color='red'><b>the ladies</b></font>)</div>in the letters of the young ladies. Then, my
Fanny's husband died in sad out-at-elbowed circumstances, leaving
no provision for his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) widow and her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) infant; and, in one of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) annual
voyages, Captain Franks brought over Mrs. Mountain, in the Young Rachel,
to Virginia.

<p/>There was plenty of room in Castlewood House, and Mrs. Mountain served
to enliven the place. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mountain</b></font>) played cards with the mistress: she (<font color='blue'><b>Mountain</b></font>) had some
knowledge of music, and could help the eldest boy in that way: she (<font color='blue'><b>Mountain</b></font>)
laughed and was pleased with the guests: she (<font color='blue'><b>Mountain</b></font>) saw to the strangers'
chambers, and presided over the presses and the linen. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mountain</b></font>) was a kind,
brisk, jolly-looking widow, and more than one unmarried gentleman of the
colony asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Mountain</b></font>) to change her (<font color='blue'><b>Mountain</b></font>) name for his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) own. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Mountain</b></font>) chose to keep
that of Mountain, though, and perhaps because, it had brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Mountain</b></font>) no
good fortune. One marriage was enough for her (<font color='blue'><b>Mountain</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Mountain</b></font>) said. Mr. Mountain
had amiably spent her (<font color='blue'><b>Mountain</b></font>) little fortune and his (<font color='blue'><b>Mountain</b></font>) own. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Mountain</b></font>) last trinkets went
to pay his (<font color='blue'><b>Mountain</b></font>) funeral; and, as long as Madam Warrington would keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Mountain</b></font>) at
Castlewood, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mountain</b></font>) preferred a home without a husband to any which as
yet had been offered to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mountain</b></font>) in Virginia. The two ladies quarrelled
plentifully; but they loved each other: they made up their differences:
they fell out again, to be reconciled presently. When either of the boys
was ill, each lady vied with the other in maternal tenderness and care.
In his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) last days and illness, Mrs. Mountain's cheerfulness and kindness
had been greatly appreciated by the Colonel, whose memory Madam
Warrington regarded more than that of any living person. So that, year
after year, when Captain Franks would ask Mrs. Mountain, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Franks</b></font>) pleasant
way, whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Mountain</b></font>) was going back with him (<font color='blue'><b>Franks</b></font>) that voyage? she (<font color='blue'><b>Mountain</b></font>) would decline,
and say that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mountain</b></font>) proposed to stay a year more.

<p/>And when suitors came to Madam Warrington, as come they would, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mountain</b></font>) would
receive their compliments and attentions kindly enough, and asked more
than one of these lovers whether it was Mrs. Mountain he (<font color='blue'><b>Franks</b></font>) came after? She (<font color='blue'><b>Mountain</b></font>)
would use her (<font color='blue'><b>Mountain</b></font>) best offices with Mountain. Fanny was the best creature,
was of a good English family, and would make any gentleman happy. Did
the Squire declare it was to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) and not her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) dependant that he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) paid his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>)
addresses; she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) would make him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) gravest curtsey, say that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) really
had been utterly mistaken as to his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) views, and let him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) know that the
daughter of the Marquis of Esmond lived for her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) people and her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) sons,
and did not propose to change her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) condition. Have we not read how Queen
Elizabeth was a perfectly sensible woman of business, and was pleased to
inspire not only terror and awe, but love in the bosoms of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) subjects?
So the little Virginian princess had her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) favourites, and accepted their
flatteries, and grew tired of them, and was cruel or kind to them as
suited her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) wayward imperial humour. There was no amount of compliment
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) would not graciously receive and take as her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) due. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) little
foible was so well known that the wags used to practise upon it.
Rattling Jack Firebrace of Henrico county had free quarters for months
at Castlewood, and was a prime favourite with the lady there, because
he (<font color='blue'><b>Firebrace</b></font>) addressed verses to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) which he (<font color='blue'><b>Firebrace</b></font>) stole out of the pocket-books. Tom
Humbold of Spotsylvania wagered fifty hogsheads against five that he (<font color='blue'><b>Humbold</b></font>)
would make her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) institute an order of knighthood, and won his (<font color='blue'><b>Humbold</b></font>) wager.

<p/>The elder boy saw these freaks and oddities of his (<font color='blue'><b>Humbold</b></font>) good mother's
disposition, and chafed and raged at them privately. From very early
days he (<font color='blue'><b>Humbold</b></font>) revolted when flatteries and compliments were paid to the little
lady, and strove to expose them with his (<font color='blue'><b>Humbold</b></font>) juvenile satire; so that
his (<font color='blue'><b>Humbold</b></font>) mother would say gravely, <div class="bookquote">``The Esmonds were always of a jealous
disposition, and my poor boy takes after my father and mother in this.''
 (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>George hated Jack Firebrace and Tom Humbold, and all their like;
whereas Harry went out sporting with them, and fowling, and fishing, and
cock-fighting, and enjoyed all the fun of the country.

<p/>One winter, after their first tutor had been dismissed, Madam Esmond
took them to Williamsburg, for such education as the schools and college
there afforded, and there it was the fortune of the family to listen to
the preaching of the famous Mr. Whitfield, who had come into Virginia,
where the habits and preaching of the established clergy were not very
edifying. Unlike many of the neighbouring provinces, Virginia was a
Church of England colony: the clergymen were paid by the State and had
glebes allotted to them; and, there being no Church of England bishop as
yet in America, the colonists were obliged to import their divines from
the mother-country. Such as came were not, naturally, of the very best
or most eloquent kind of pastors. Noblemen's hangers-on, insolvent
parsons who had quarrelled with justice or the bailiff, brought their
stained cassocks into the colony in the hopes of finding a living there.
No wonder that Whitfield's great voice stirred those whom harmless Mr.
Broadbent, the Williamsburg chaplain, never could awaken. At first the
boys were as much excited as their mother by Mr. Whitfield: they sang
hymns, and listened to him (<font color='blue'><b>Whitfield</b></font>) with fervour, and, could he (<font color='blue'><b>Whitfield</b></font>) have remained
long enough among them, Harry and George had both worn black coats
probably instead of epaulettes. The simple boys communicated their
experiences to one another, and were on the daily and nightly look-out
for the sacred <div class="bookquote">``call,''  (<font color='red'><b>The boys</b></font>)</div>in the hope or the possession of which such a
vast multitude of Protestant England was thrilling at the time.

<p/>But Mr. Whitfield could not stay always with the little congregation of
Williamsburg. His (<font color='blue'><b>Whitfield</b></font>) mission was to enlighten the whole benighted people of
the Church, and from the East to the West to trumpet the truth and bid
slumbering sinners awaken. However, he (<font color='blue'><b>Whitfield</b></font>) comforted the widow with precious
letters, and promised to send her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) a tutor for her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) sons who should be
capable of teaching them not only profane learning, but of strengthening
and confirming them in science much more precious.

<p/>In due course, a chosen vessel arrived from England. Young Mr. Ward had
a voice as loud as Mr. Whitfield's, and could talk almost as readily
and for as long a time. Night and evening the hall sounded with his (<font color='blue'><b>Whitfield</b></font>)
exhortations. The domestic negroes crept to the doors to listen to him (<font color='blue'><b>Whitfield</b></font>).
Other servants darkened the porch windows with their crisp heads to hear
him (<font color='blue'><b>Whitfield</b></font>) discourse. It was over the black sheep of the Castlewood flock that
Mr. Ward somehow had the most influence. These woolly lamblings were
immensely affected by his (<font color='blue'><b>Ward</b></font>) exhortations, and, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Ward</b></font>) gave out the hymn,
there was such a negro chorus about the house as might be heard across
the Potomac--such a chorus as would never have been heard in the
Colonel's time--for that worthy gentleman had a suspicion of all
cassocks, and said he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) would never have any controversy with a clergyman
but upon backgammon. Where money was wanted for charitable purposes no
man was more ready, and the good, easy Virginian clergyman, who loved
backgammon heartily, too, said that the worthy Colonel's charity must
cover his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) other shortcomings.

<p/>Ward was a handsome young man. His (<font color='blue'><b>Ward</b></font>) preaching pleased Madam Esmond from
the first, and, I daresay, satisfied her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) as much as Mr. Whitfield's. Of
course it cannot be the case at the present day when they are so finely
educated, but women, a hundred years ago, were credulous, eager to
admire and believe, and apt to imagine all sorts of excellences in the
object of their admiration. For weeks, nay, months, Madam Esmond
was never tired of hearing Mr. Ward's great glib voice and voluble
commonplaces: and, according to her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) wont, she (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) insisted that her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>)
neighbours should come and listen to him (<font color='blue'><b>Ward</b></font>), and ordered them to be
converted. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) young favourite, Mr. Washington, she (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) was especially
anxious to influence; and again and again pressed him (<font color='blue'><b>Washington</b></font>) to come and
stay at Castlewood and benefit by the spiritual advantages there to
be obtained. But that young gentleman found he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had particular business
which called him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) home or away from home, and always ordered his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) horse
of evenings when the time was coming for Mr. Ward's exercises. And--what
boys are just towards their pedagogue?--the twins grew speedily tired
and even rebellious under their new teacher.

<p/>They found him (<font color='blue'><b>Ward</b></font>) a bad scholar, a dull fellow, and ill-bred to boot.
George knew much more Latin and Greek than his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) master, and caught him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
in perpetual blunders and false quantities. Harry, who could take much
greater liberties than were allowed to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) elder brother, mimicked
Ward's manner of eating and talking, so that Mrs. Mountain and even
Madam Esmond were forced to laugh, and little Fanny Mountain would crow
with delight. Madam Esmond would have found the fellow out for a vulgar
quack but for her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) sons' opposition, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>), on her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) part, opposed with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) own indomitable will. <div class="bookquote">``What matters whether he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) has more or less of
profane learning?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) asked; <div class="bookquote">``in that which is most precious, Mr. W.
is able to be a teacher to all of us. What if his (<font color='blue'><b>W.</b></font>) manners are a little
rough? Heaven does not choose its elect from among the great and
wealthy. I wish you knew one book, children, as well as Mr. Ward does.
It is your wicked pride--the pride of all the Esmonds--which prevents
you from listening to him (<font color='blue'><b>Ward</b></font>). Go down on your knees in your chamber and
pray to be corrected of that dreadful fault.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Ward's discourse that
evening was about Naaman the Syrian, and the pride he (<font color='blue'><b>Ward</b></font>) had in his (<font color='blue'><b>Ward</b></font>) native
rivers of Abana and Pharpar, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Ward</b></font>) vainly imagined to be superior to
the healing waters of Jordan--the moral being, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ward</b></font>), Ward, was the
keeper and guardian of the undoubted waters of Jordan, and that the
unhappy, conceited boys must go to perdition unless they came to him (<font color='blue'><b>Ward</b></font>).

<p/>George now began to give way to a wicked sarcastic method, which,
perhaps, he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) had inherited from his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) grandfather, and with which, when a
quiet, skilful young person chooses to employ it, he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) can make a whole
family uncomfortable. He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) took up Ward's pompous remarks and made jokes
of them, so that that young divine chafed and almost choked over his (<font color='blue'><b>Ward</b></font>)
great meals. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ward</b></font>) made Madam Esmond angry, and doubly so when he (<font color='blue'><b>Ward</b></font>) sent
off Harry into fits of laughter. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) authority was defied, her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) officer
scorned and insulted, her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) youngest child perverted, by the obstinate
elder brother. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) made a desperate and unhappy attempt to maintain her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>)
power.

<p/>The boys were fourteen years of age, Harry being taller and much more
advanced than his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) brother, who was delicate, and as yet almost childlike
in stature and appearance. The baculine method was a quite common mode
of argument in those days. Sergeants, schoolmasters, slave-overseers,
used the cane freely. Our little boys had been horsed many a day by Mr.
Dempster, their Scotch tutor, in their grandfather's time; and Harry,
especially, had got to be quite accustomed to the practice, and made
very light of it. But, in the interregnum after Colonel Esmond's death,
the cane had been laid aside, and the young gentlemen of Castlewood
had been allowed to have their own way. Her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) own and her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) lieutenant's
authority being now spurned by the youthful rebels, the unfortunate
mother thought of restoring it by means of coercion. She (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) took counsel
of Mr. Ward. That athletic young pedagogue could easily find chapter and
verse to warrant the course which he (<font color='blue'><b>Ward</b></font>) wished to pursue--in fact, there
was no doubt about the wholesomeness of the practice in those clays. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ward</b></font>)
had begun by flattering the boys, finding a good berth and snug quarters
at Castlewood, and hoping to remain there.

<p/>But they laughed at his (<font color='blue'><b>Ward</b></font>) flattery, they scorned his (<font color='blue'><b>Ward</b></font>) bad manners, they
yawned soon at his (<font color='blue'><b>Ward</b></font>) sermons; the more their mother favoured him (<font color='blue'><b>Ward</b></font>), the more
they disliked him (<font color='blue'><b>Ward</b></font>); and so the tutor and the pupils cordially hated each
other. Mrs. Mountain, who was the boys' friend, especially George's
friend, whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Mountain</b></font>) thought unjustly treated by his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) mother, warned the lads
to be prudent, and that some conspiracy was hatching against them. ``Ward
is more obsequious than ever to your mamma. It turns my stomach, it
does, to hear him (<font color='blue'><b>Ward</b></font>) flatter, and to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Ward</b></font>) gobble--the odious wretch! You
must be on your guard, my poor boys--you must learn your lessons, and
not anger your tutor. A mischief will come, I know it will. Your mamma
was talking about you to Mr. Washington the other day, when I came into
the room. I don't like that Major Washington, you know I don't. Don't
say--O Mounty! Master Harry. You always stand up for your friends, you
do. The Major is very handsome and tall, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Major</b></font>) may be very good, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Major</b></font>)
is much too old a young man for me. Bless you, my dears, the quantity
of wild oats your father sowed and my own poor Mountain when they were
ensigns in Kingsley's, would fill sacks full! Show me Mr. Washington's
wild oats, I say--not a grain! Well, I happened to step in last Tuesday,
when he (<font color='blue'><b>Washington</b></font>) was here with your mamma; and I am sure they were talking about
you, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Washington</b></font>) said, `Discipline is discipline, and must be preserved.
There can be but one command in a house, ma’am, and you must be the
mistress of yours.'''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The very words he (<font color='blue'><b>Washington</b></font>) used to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>cries Harry. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Washington</b></font>) told me that he (<font color='blue'><b>Washington</b></font>) did not
like to meddle with other folks' affairs, but that our mother was very
angry, dangerously angry, he (<font color='blue'><b>Washington</b></font>) said, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Washington</b></font>) begged me to obey Mr. Ward,
and specially to press George to do so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Let him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) manage his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) own house, not mine,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>says George, very haughtily.
And the caution, far from benefiting him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>), only rendered the lad more
supercilious and refractory.

<p/>On the next day the storm broke, and vengeance fell on the little
rebel's head. Words passed between George and Mr. Ward during the
morning study. The boy was quite insubordinate and unjust: even his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
faithful brother cried out, and owned that he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was in the wrong. Mr. Ward
kept his (<font color='blue'><b>Ward</b></font>) temper--to compress, bottle up, cork down, and prevent your
anger from present furious explosion, is called keeping your temper--and
said he (<font color='blue'><b>Ward</b></font>) should speak upon this business to Madam Esmond. When the family
met at dinner, Mr. Ward requested her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) ladyship to stay, and, temperately
enough, laid the subject of dispute before her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>).

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ward</b></font>) asked Master Harry to confirm what he (<font color='blue'><b>Ward</b></font>) had said: and poor Harry was
obliged to admit all the dominie's statements.

<p/>George, standing under his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) grandfather's portrait by the chimney, said
haughtily that what Mr. Ward had said was perfectly correct.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``To be a tutor to such a pupil is absurd,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Ward/Ward</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Ward, making a long
speech, interspersed with many of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ward</b></font>) usual Scripture phrases, at each
of which, as they occurred, that wicked young George smiled, and pished
scornfully, and at length Ward ended by asking her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) honour's leave to
retire.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not before you have punished this wicked and disobedient child,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madam Esmond/Madam Esmond Warrington/Madam Warrington</b></font>)</div>said
Madam Esmond, who had been gathering anger during Ward's harangue, and
especially at her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) son's behaviour.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Punish!''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>says George.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir, punish! If means of love and entreaty fail, as they have with
your proud heart, other means must be found to bring you to obedience.
I punish you now, rebellious boy, to guard you from greater punishment
hereafter. The discipline of this family must be maintained. There can
be but one command in a house, and I must be the mistress of mine. You
will punish this refractory boy, Mr. Ward, as we have agreed that you
should do, and if there is the least resistance on his (<font color='blue'><b>Ward</b></font>) part, my overseer
and servants will lend you aid.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the widow</b></font>)</div><p/>In some such words the widow no doubt must have spoken, but with many
vehement Scriptural allusions, which it does not become this
chronicler to copy. To be for ever applying to the Sacred Oracles, and
accommodating their sentences to your purpose--to be for ever taking
Heaven into your confidence about your private affairs, and
passionately calling for its interference in your family quarrels and
difficulties--to be so familiar with its designs and schemes as to be
able to threaten your neighbour with its thunders, and to know precisely
its intentions regarding him (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) and others who differ from your infallible
opinion--this was the schooling which our simple widow had received from
her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) impetuous young spiritual guide, and I doubt whether it brought her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>)
much comfort.

<p/>In the midst of his (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) mother's harangue, in spite of it, perhaps, George
Esmond felt he (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) had been wrong. <div class="bookquote">``There can be but one command in the
house, and you must be mistress--I know who said those words before
you,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>George said, slowly, and looking very white--<div class="bookquote">``and--and I know,
mother, that I have acted wrongly to Mr. Ward.''

 (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Ward</b></font>) owns it! He (<font color='blue'><b>Ward</b></font>) asks pardon!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>cries Harry. <div class="bookquote">``That's right, George! That's
enough: isn't it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, it is not enough!''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>cried the little woman. <div class="bookquote">``The disobedient boy
must pay the penalty of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) disobedience. When I was headstrong, as I
sometimes was as a child before my spirit was changed and humbled, my
mamma punished me, and I submitted. So must George. I desire you will do
your duty, Mr. Ward.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Stop, mother!--you don't quite know what you are doing,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>George said,
exceedingly agitated.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I know that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ward</b></font>) who spares the rod spoils the child, ungrateful boy!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Madam Esmond/Madam Esmond Warrington/Madam Warrington</b></font>)</div>says Madam Esmond, with more references of the same nature, which George
heard, looking very pale and desperate.

<p/>Upon the mantelpiece, under the Colonel's portrait, stood a china
cup, by which the widow set great store, as her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) father had always been
accustomed to drink from it. George suddenly took it, and a strange
smile passed over his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) pale face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Stay one minute. Don't go away yet,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) cried to his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) mother, who was
leaving the room. <div class="bookquote">``You--you are very fond of this cup, mother?'' (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>--and
Harry looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), wondering. <div class="bookquote">``If I broke it, it could never be
mended, could it? All the tinkers' rivets would not make it a whole cup
again. My dear old grandpapa's cup! I have been wrong. Mr. Ward, I ask
pardon. I will try and amend.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The widow</b></font>)</div><p/>The widow looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) son indignantly, almost scornfully. <div class="bookquote">``I thought,''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I thought an Esmond had been more of a man than to be afraid,
and--''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>here she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) gave a little scream as Harry uttered an exclamation,
and dashed forward with his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hands stretched out towards his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) brother.

<p/>George, after looking at the cup, raised it, opened his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) hand, and let it
fall on the marble slab below him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>). Harry had tried in vain to catch it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is too late, Hal,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>George said. <div class="bookquote">``You will never mend that
again--never. Now, mother, I am ready, as it is your wish. Will you come
and see whether I am afraid? Mr. Ward, I am your servant. Your servant?
Your slave! And the next time I meet Mr. Washington, madam, I will thank
him (<font color='blue'><b>Washington</b></font>) for the advice which he (<font color='blue'><b>Washington</b></font>) gave you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I say, do your duty, sir!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Warrington/Mrs. Esmond/Mrs. Esmond Warrington</b></font>)</div>cried Mrs. Esmond, stamping her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) little foot.
And George, making a low bow to Mr. Ward, begged him (<font color='blue'><b>Ward</b></font>) to go first out of
the room to the study.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Stop! For God's sake, mother, stop!''  (<font color='red'><b>Hal</b></font>)</div>cried poor Hal. But passion was
boiling in the little woman's heart, and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would not hear the boy's
petition. <div class="bookquote">``You only abet him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), sir!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) cried.--<div class="bookquote">``If I had to do it
myself, it should be done!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>And Harry, with sadness and wrath in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
countenance, left the room by the door through which Mr. Ward and his (<font color='blue'><b>Ward</b></font>)
brother had just issued.

<p/>The widow sank down on a great chair near it, and sat a while vacantly
looking at the fragments of the broken cup. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) inclined her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) head
towards the door--one of half a dozen of carved mahogany which the
Colonel had brought from Europe. For a while there was silence: then a
loud outcry, which made the poor mother start.

<p/>In another minute Mr. Ward came out bleeding, from a great wound on his (<font color='blue'><b>Ward</b></font>)
head, and behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Ward</b></font>) Harry, with flaring eyes, and brandishing a little
couteau-de-chasse of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) grandfather, which hung, with others of the
Colonel's weapons, on the library wall.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't care. I did it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>says Harry. <div class="bookquote">``I couldn't see this fellow strike
my brother; and, as he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) lifted his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) hand, I flung the great ruler at him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>).
I couldn't help it. I won't bear it; and, if one lifts a hand to me or
my brother, I'll have his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) life,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>shouts Harry, brandishing the hanger.

<p/>The widow gave a great gasp and a sigh as she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) looked at the young
champion and his (<font color='blue'><b>champion</b></font>) victim. She (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) must have suffered terribly during the few
minutes of the boys' absence; and the stripes which she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) imagined had
been inflicted on the elder had smitten her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) own heart. She (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) longed
to take both boys to it. She (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) was not angry now. Very likely she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) was
delighted with the thought of the younger's prowess and generosity.
<div class="bookquote">``You are a very naughty disobedient child,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) said, in an exceedingly
peaceable voice. <div class="bookquote">``My poor Mr. Ward! What a rebel, to strike you! Papa's
great ebony ruler, was it? Lay down that hanger, child. `Twas General
Webb gave it to my papa after the siege of Lille. Let me bathe your
wound, my good Mr. Ward, and thank Heaven it was no worse. Mountain!
Go fetch me some court-plaster out of the middle drawer in the japan
cabinet. Here comes George. Put on your coat and waistcoat, child! You
were going to take your punishment, sir, and that is sufficient. Ask
pardon, Harry, of good Mr. Ward, for your wicked rebellious spirit,--I
do, with all my heart, I am sure. And guard against your passionate
nature, child--and pray to be forgiven. My son, O my son!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Here, with a
burst of tears which she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) could no longer control, the little woman threw
herself on the neck of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) eldest-born; whilst Harry, laying the hanger
down, went up very feebly to Mr. Ward, and said, <div class="bookquote">``Indeed, I ask your
pardon, sir. I couldn't help it; on my honour I couldn't; nor bear to
see my brother struck.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Ward/Ward</b></font>)</div><p/>The widow was scared, as after her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) embrace she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) looked up at George's
pale face. In reply to her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) eager caresses, he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) coldly kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) on the
forehead, and separated from her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``You meant for the best, mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
said, <div class="bookquote">``and I was in the wrong. But the cup is broken; and all the king's
horses and all the king's men cannot mend it. There--put the fair side
outwards on the mantelpiece, and the wound will not show.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Again Madam Esmond looked at the lad, as he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) placed the fragments of the
poor cup on the ledge where it had always been used to stand. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) power
over him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) was gone. He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) had dominated her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) was not sorry for the
defeat; for women like not only to conquer, but to be conquered; and
from that day the young gentleman was master at Castlewood. His (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) mother
admired him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) went up to Harry, graciously and condescendingly gave
Hal his (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>) hand, and said, <div class="bookquote">``Thank you, brother!''  (<font color='red'><b>Hal</b></font>)</div>as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>) were a prince,
and Harry a general who had helped him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) in a great battle.

<p/>Then George went up to Mr. Ward, who was still piteously bathing his (<font color='blue'><b>Ward</b></font>)
eye and forehead in the water. <div class="bookquote">``I ask pardon for Hal's violence, sir,''
 (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>George said, in great state. <div class="bookquote">``You see, though we are very young, we
are gentlemen, and cannot brook an insult from strangers. I should
have submitted, as it was mamma's desire; but I am glad she (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) no longer
entertains it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And pray, sir, who is to compensate me?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Ward/Ward</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Ward; <div class="bookquote">``who is to
repair the insult done to me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Ward/Ward</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We are very young,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>says George, with another of his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) old-fashioned
bows. <div class="bookquote">``We shall be fifteen soon. Any compensation that is usual amongst
gentlemen''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``This, sir, to a minister of the Word!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Ward/Ward</b></font>)</div>bawls out Ward, starting up,
and who knew perfectly well the lads' skill in fence, having a score of
times been foiled by the pair of them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are not a clergyman yet. We thought you might like to be considered
as a gentleman. We did not know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A gentleman! I am a Christian, sir!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Ward/Ward</b></font>)</div>says Ward, glaring furiously, and
clenching his (<font color='blue'><b>Ward</b></font>) great fists.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, well, if you won't fight, why don't you forgive?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>says Harry. <div class="bookquote">``If
you don't forgive, why don't you fight? That's what I call the horns of
a dilemma;''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) laughed his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) frank, jolly laugh.


<p/>But this was nothing to the laugh a few days afterwards, when, the
quarrel having been patched up, along with poor Mr. Ward's eye, the
unlucky tutor was holding forth according to his (<font color='blue'><b>Ward</b></font>) custom. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ward</b></font>) tried to
preach the boys into respect for him (<font color='blue'><b>Ward</b></font>), to reawaken the enthusiasm which
the congregation had felt for him (<font color='blue'><b>Ward</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Ward</b></font>) wrestled with their manifest
indifference, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ward</b></font>) implored Heaven to warm their cold hearts again, and to
lift up those who were falling back. All was in vain. The widow wept no
more at his (<font color='blue'><b>Ward</b></font>) harangues, was no longer excited by his (<font color='blue'><b>Ward</b></font>) loudest tropes and
similes, nor appeared to be much frightened by the very hottest menaces
with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Ward</b></font>) peppered his (<font color='blue'><b>Ward</b></font>) discourse. Nay, she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) pleaded headache, and
would absent herself of an evening, on which occasion the remainder of
the little congregation was very cold indeed. One day, then, Ward,
still making desperate efforts to get back his (<font color='blue'><b>Ward</b></font>) despised authority, was
preaching on the beauty of subordination, the present lax spirit of the
age, and the necessity of obeying our spiritual and temporal rulers.
<div class="bookquote">``For why, my dear friends,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Ward</b></font>) nobly asked -LRB-he (<font color='blue'><b>Ward</b></font>) was in the habit of
asking immensely dull questions, and straightway answering them with
corresponding platitudes-RRB-, <div class="bookquote">``why are governors appointed, but that we
should be governed? Why are tutors engaged, but that children should be
taught?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>-LRB-here a look at the boys-RRB-. <div class="bookquote">``Why are rulers--''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Here he (<font color='blue'><b>Ward</b></font>) paused,
looking with a sad, puzzled face at the young gentlemen. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ward</b></font>) saw in their
countenances the double meaning of the unlucky word he (<font color='blue'><b>Ward</b></font>) had uttered,
and stammered, and thumped the table with his (<font color='blue'><b>Ward</b></font>) fist. <div class="bookquote">``Why, I say, are
rulers--''

 (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Rulers,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>says George, looking at Harry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Rulers!''  (<font color='red'><b>Hal</b></font>)</div>says Hal, putting his (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>) hand to his (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>) eye, where the poor tutor
still bore marks of the late scuffle. Rulers, o-ho! It was too much. The
boys burst out in an explosion of laughter. Mrs. Mountain, who was full
of fun, could not help joining in the chorus; and little Fanny, who had
always behaved very demurely and silently at these ceremonies, crowed
again, and clapped her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) little hands at the others laughing, not in the
least knowing the reason why.

<p/>This could not be borne. Ward shut down the book before him (<font color='blue'><b>Ward</b></font>); in a few
angry, but eloquent and manly words, said he (<font color='blue'><b>Ward</b></font>) would speak no more in that
place; and left Castlewood not in the least regretted by Madam Esmond,
who had doted on him (<font color='blue'><b>Ward</b></font>) three months before.




<p/>CHAPTER VI. The Virginians begin to see the World


<p/>After the departure of her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) unfortunate spiritual adviser and chaplain,
Madam Esmond and her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) son seemed to be quite reconciled: but although
George never spoke of the quarrel with his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) mother, it must have weighed
upon the boy's mind very painfully, for he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) had a fever soon after the
last recounted domestic occurrences, during which illness his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) brain
once or twice wandered, when he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) shrieked out, <div class="bookquote">``Broken! Broken! It never,
never can be mended!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>to the silent terror of his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) mother, who sate
watching the poor child as he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) tossed wakeful upon his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) midnight bed.
His (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) malady defied her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) skill, and increased in spite of all the nostrums
which the good widow kept in her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) closet and administered so freely to
her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) people. She (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) had to undergo another humiliation, and one day little
Mr. Dempster beheld her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) at his (<font color='blue'><b>Dempster</b></font>) door on horseback. She (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) had ridden through
the snow on her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) pony, to implore him (<font color='blue'><b>Dempster</b></font>) to give his (<font color='blue'><b>Dempster</b></font>) aid to her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) poor boy. <div class="bookquote">``I
shall bury my resentment, madam,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Dempster</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``as your ladyship buried your
pride. Please God, I maybe time enough to help my dear young pupil!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>So
he (<font color='blue'><b>Dempster</b></font>) put up his (<font color='blue'><b>Dempster</b></font>) lancet, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Dempster</b></font>) little provision of medicaments; called
his (<font color='blue'><b>Dempster</b></font>) only negro-boy after him (<font color='blue'><b>Dempster</b></font>), shut up his (<font color='blue'><b>Dempster</b></font>) lonely hut, and once more
returned to Castlewood. That night and for some days afterwards it
seemed very likely that poor Harry would become heir of Castlewood; but
by Mr. Dempster's skill the fever was got over, the intermittent attacks
diminished in intensity, and George was restored almost to health again.
A change of air, a voyage even to England, was recommended, but the
widow had quarrelled with her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) children's relatives there, and owned with
contrition that she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) had been too hasty. A journey to the north and east
was determined on, and the two young gentlemen, with Mr. Dempster as
their tutor, and a couple of servants to attend them, took a voyage to
New York, and thence up the beautiful Hudson river to Albany, where they
were received by the first gentry of the province, and thence into the
French provinces, where they had the best recommendations, and were
hospitably entertained by the French gentry. Harry camped with the
Indians, and took furs and shot bears. George, who never cared for
field-sports, and whose health was still delicate, was a special
favourite with the French ladies, who were accustomed to see very few
young English gentlemen speaking the French language so readily as our
young gentlemen. George especially perfected his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) accent so as to be able
to pass for a Frenchman. He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) had the bel air completely, every person
allowed. He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) danced the minuet elegantly. He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) learned the latest imported
French catches and songs, and played them beautifully on his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) violin,
and would have sung them too but that his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) voice broke at this time, and
changed from treble to bass; and, to the envy of poor Harry, who was
absent on a bear-hunt, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) even had an affair of honour with a young
ensign of the regiment of Auvergne, the Chevalier de la Jabotiere, whom
he (<font color='blue'><b>Chevalier</b></font>) pinked in the shoulder, and with whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Chevalier</b></font>) afterwards swore an eternal
friendship. Madame de Mouchy, the superintendent's lady, said the mother
was blest who had such a son, and wrote a complimentary letter to Madam
Esmond upon Mr. George's behaviour. I fear, Mr. Whitfield would not
have been over-pleased with the widow's elation on hearing of her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) son's
prowess.

<p/>When the lads returned home at the end of ten delightful months, their
mother was surprised at their growth and improvement. George especially
was so grown as to come up to his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) younger-born brother. The boys could
hardly be distinguished one from another, especially when their hair was
powdered; but that ceremony being too cumbrous for country life, each
of the gentlemen commonly wore his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) own hair, George his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) raven black, and
Harry his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) light locks tied with a ribbon.

<p/>The reader who has been so kind as to look over the first pages of the
lad's simple biography, must have observed that Mr. George Esmond was
of a jealous and suspicious disposition, most generous and gentle and
incapable of an untruth, and though too magnanimous to revenge, almost
incapable of forgiving any injury. George left home with no goodwill
towards an honourable gentleman, whose name afterwards became one of the
most famous in the world; and he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) returned from his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) journey not in the
least altered in his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) opinion of his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) mother's and grandfather's friend.
Mr. Washington, though then but just of age, looked and felt much older.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Washington</b></font>) always exhibited an extraordinary simplicity and gravity; he (<font color='blue'><b>Washington</b></font>) had
managed his (<font color='blue'><b>Washington</b></font>) mother's and his (<font color='blue'><b>Washington</b></font>) family's affairs from a very early age, and
was trusted by all his (<font color='blue'><b>Washington</b></font>) friends and the gentry of his (<font color='blue'><b>Washington</b></font>) county more than
persons twice his (<font color='blue'><b>Washington</b></font>) senior.

<p/>Mrs. Mountain, Madam Esmond's friend and companion, who dearly loved the
two boys and her (<font color='blue'><b>Mountain</b></font>) patroness, in spite of many quarrels with the latter,
and daily threats of parting, was a most amusing, droll letter-writer,
and used to write to the two boys on their travels. Now, Mrs. Mountain
was of a jealous turn likewise; especially she (<font color='blue'><b>Mountain</b></font>) had a great turn for
match-making, and fancied that everybody had a design to marry everybody
else. There scarce came an unmarried man to Castlewood but Mountain
imagined the gentleman had an eye towards the mistress of the mansion.
She (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) was positive that odious Mr. Ward intended to make love to
the widow, and pretty sure the latter liked him (<font color='blue'><b>Ward</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) knew that Mr.
Washington wanted to be married, was certain that such a shrewd young
gentleman would look out for a rich wife, and, as for the differences of
ages, what matter that the Major -LRB-major was his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) rank in the militia-RRB-
was fifteen years younger than Madam Esmond? They were used to such
marriages in the family; my lady her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) mother was how many years older
than the Colonel when she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) married him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>)?--When she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) married him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) and was so
jealous that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) never would let the poor Colonel out of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) sight.
The poor Colonel! after his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) wife, he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) had been henpecked by his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) little
daughter. And she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) would take after her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) mother, and marry again, be
sure of that. Madam was a little chit of a woman, not five feet in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
highest headdress and shoes, and Mr. Washington a great tall man of
six feet two. Great tall men always married little chits of women:
therefore, Mr. W. must be looking after the widow. What could be more
clear than the deduction?

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) communicated these sage opinions to her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) boy, as she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) called George,
who begged her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>), for Heaven's sake, to hold her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) tongue. This she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) said she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>)
could do, but she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) could not keep her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) eyes always shut; and she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) narrated
a hundred circumstances which had occurred in the young gentleman's
absence, and which tended, as she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) thought, to confirm her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) notions. Had
Mountain imparted these pretty suspicions to his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) brother? George asked
sternly. No. George was her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) boy; Harry was his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) mother's boy. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>) likes
him (<font color='blue'><b>pupil</b></font>) best, and I like you best, George,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>cries Mountain. <div class="bookquote">``Besides, if I
were to speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) would tell your mother in a minute. Poor Harry
can keep nothing quiet, and then there would be a pretty quarrel between
Madam and me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I beg you to keep this quiet, Mountain,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>said Mr. George, with great
dignity, <div class="bookquote">``or you and I shall quarrel too. Neither to me nor to any one
else in the world must you mention such an absurd suspicion.''

 (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div><p/>Absurd! Why absurd? Mr. Washington was constantly with the widow. His (<font color='blue'><b>Washington</b></font>)
name was forever in her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) mouth. She (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) was never tired of pointing out his (<font color='blue'><b>Washington</b></font>)
virtues and examples to her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) sons. She (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) consulted him (<font color='blue'><b>Washington</b></font>) on every question
respecting her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) estate and its management. She (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) never bought a horse
or sold a barrel of tobacco without his (<font color='blue'><b>Washington</b></font>) opinion. There was a room at
Castlewood regularly called Mr. Washington's room. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) actually leaves
his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) clothes here and his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) portmanteau when he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) goes away. Ah! George,
George! One day will come when he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) won't go away,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>groaned Mountain, who,
of course, always returned to the subject of which she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) was forbidden
to speak. Meanwhile Mr. George adopted towards his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) mother's favourite a
frigid courtesy, at which the honest gentleman chafed but did not care
to remonstrate, or a stinging sarcasm, which he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) would break through as
he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) would burst through so many brambles on those hunting excursions
in which he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) and Harry Warrington rode so constantly together; whilst
George, retreating to his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) tents, read mathematics, and French, and
Latin, and sulked in his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) book-room more and more lonely.

<p/>Harry was away from home with some other sporting friends -LRB-it is to be
feared the young gentleman's acquaintances were not all as eligible as
Mr. Washington-RRB-, when the latter came to pay a visit at Castlewood. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>)
was so peculiarly tender and kind to the mistress there, and received by
her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) with such special cordiality, that George Warrington's jealousy had
well-nigh broken out in open rupture. But the visit was one of adieu, as
it appeared.

<p/>Major Washington was going on a long and dangerous journey, quite to the
western Virginia frontier and beyond it. The French had been for some
time past making inroads into our territory. The government at home,
as well as those of Virginia and Pennsylvania, were alarmed at this
aggressive spirit of the Lords of Canada and Louisiana. Some of our
settlers had already been driven from their holdings by Frenchmen in
arms, and the governors of the British provinces were desirous to stop
their incursions, or at any rate to protest against their invasion.

<p/>We chose to hold our American colonies by a law that was at least
convenient for its framers. The maxim was, that whoever possessed the
coast had a right to all the territory inland as far as the Pacific; so
that the British charters only laid down the limits of the colonies from
north to south, leaving them quite free from east to west. The French,
meanwhile, had their colonies to the north and south, and aimed at
connecting them by the Mississippi and the St. Lawrence and the great
intermediate lakes and waters lying to the westward of the British
possessions. In the year 1748, though peace was signed between the
two European kingdoms, the colonial question remained unsettled, to be
opened again when either party should be strong enough to urge it. In
the year 1753, it came to an issue, on the Ohio river, where the British
and French settlers met. To be sure, there existed other people besides
French and British, who thought they had a title to the territory about
which the children of their White Fathers were battling, namely, the
native Indians and proprietors of the soil. But the logicians of St.
James's and Versailles wisely chose to consider the matter in dispute
as a European and not a Red-man's question, eliminating him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) from the
argument, but employing his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) tomahawk as it might serve the turn of
either litigant.

<p/>A company, called the Ohio Company, having grants from the Virginia
government of lands along that river, found themselves invaded in their
settlements by French military detachments, who roughly ejected the
Britons from their holdings. These latter applied for protection to Mr.
Dinwiddie, Lieutenant-Governor of Virginia, who determined upon sending
an ambassador to the French commanding officer on the Ohio, demanding
that the French should desist from their inroads upon the territories of
his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) Majesty King George.

<p/>Young Mr. Washington jumped eagerly at the chance of distinction which
this service afforded him (<font color='blue'><b>Washington</b></font>), and volunteered to leave his (<font color='blue'><b>Washington</b></font>) home and his (<font color='blue'><b>Washington</b></font>)
rural and professional pursuits in Virginia, to carry the governor's
message to the French officer. Taking a guide, an interpreter, and a
few attendants, and following the Indian tracks, in the fall of the year
1753, the intrepid young envoy made his (<font color='blue'><b>envoy</b></font>) way from Williamsburg almost
to the shores of Lake Erie, and found the French commander at Fort le
Boeuf. That officer's reply was brief: his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) orders were to hold the place
and drive all the English from it. The French avowed their intention of
taking possession of the Ohio. And with this rough answer the messenger
from Virginia had to return through danger and difficulty, across lonely
forest and frozen river, shaping his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) course by the compass, and camping
at night in the snow by the forest fires.

<p/>Harry Warrington cursed his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) ill-fortune that he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) had been absent from
home on a cock-fight, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) might have had chance of sport so much
nobler; and on his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) return from his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) expedition, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) had conducted
with an heroic energy and simplicity, Major Washington was a greater
favourite than ever with the lady of Castlewood. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) pointed him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) out
as a model to both her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) sons. <div class="bookquote">``Ah, Harry!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) would say, <div class="bookquote">``think of you,
with your cock-fighting and your racing-matches, and the Major away
there in the wilderness, watching the French, and battling with the
frozen rivers! Ah, George! learning may be a very good thing, but I wish
my eldest son were doing something in the service of his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) country!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I desire no better than to go home and seek for employment, ma’am,''
 (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>says George. <div class="bookquote">``You surely will not have me serve under Mr. Washington, in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Washington</b></font>) new regiment, or ask a commission from Mr. Dinwiddie?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``An Esmond can only serve with the king's commission,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Washington/Washington</b></font>)</div>says Madam, <div class="bookquote">``and
as for asking a favour from Mr. Lieutenant-Governor Dinwiddie, I would
rather beg my bread.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Washington/Washington</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Washington was at this time raising such a regiment as, with the
scanty pay and patronage of the Virginian government, he (<font color='blue'><b>Washington</b></font>) could get
together, and proposed, with the help of these men-of-war, to put a more
peremptory veto upon the French invaders than the solitary ambassador
had been enabled to lay. A small force under another officer, Colonel
Trent, had been already despatched to the west, with orders to fortify
themselves so as to be able to resist any attack of the enemy. The
French troops, greatly outnumbering ours, came up with the English
outposts, who were fortifying themselves at a place on the confines of
Pennsylvania where the great city of Pittsburg now stands. A Virginian
officer with but forty men was in no condition to resist twenty times
that number of Canadians, who appeared before his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) incomplete works. He (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>)
was suffered to draw back without molestation; and the French, taking
possession of his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) fort, strengthened it, and christened it by the name
of the Canadian governor, Du Quesne. Up to this time no actual blow of
war had been struck. The troops representing the hostile nations were in
presence--the guns were loaded, but no one as yet had cried <div class="bookquote">``Fire.''  (<font color='red'><b>The troops one</b></font>)</div>It
was strange, that in a savage forest of Pennsylvania, a young Virginian
officer should fire a shot, and waken up a war which was to last for
sixty years, which was to cover his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) own country and pass into Europe, to
cost France her (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) American colonies, to sever ours from us, and create the
great Western republic; to rage over the Old World when extinguished in
the New; and, of all the myriads engaged in the vast contest, to leave
the prize of the greatest fame with him (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) who struck the first blow!

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) little knew of the fate in store for him (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>). A simple gentleman, anxious
to serve his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) king and do his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) duty, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) volunteered for the first service,
and executed it with admirable fidelity. In the ensuing year he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) took the
command of the small body of provincial troops with which he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) marched to
repel the Frenchmen. He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) came up with their advanced guard and fired upon
them, killing their leader. After this he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had himself to fall back
with his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) troops, and was compelled to capitulate to the superior French
force. On the 4th of July, 1754, the Colonel marched out with his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) troops
from the little fort where he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) had hastily entrenched himself -LRB-and which
they called Fort Necessity-RRB-, gave up the place to the conqueror, and
took his (<font color='blue'><b>conqueror</b></font>) way home.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>conqueror</b></font>) command was over: his (<font color='blue'><b>conqueror</b></font>) regiment disbanded after the fruitless,
inglorious march and defeat. Saddened and humbled in spirit, the
young officer presented himself after a while to his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) old friends at
Castlewood. He (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) was very young: before he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) set forth on his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) first campaign
he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) may have indulged in exaggerated hopes of success, and uttered them.
<div class="bookquote">``I was angry when I parted from you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) said to George Warrington,
holding out his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) hand, which the other eagerly took. <div class="bookquote">``You seemed to
scorn me and my regiment, George. I thought you laughed at us, and your
ridicule made me angry. I boasted too much of what we would do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, you have done your best, George,''  (<font color='red'><b>comrade</b></font>)</div>says the other, who quite forgot
his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) previous jealousy in his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) old comrade's misfortune. <div class="bookquote">``Everybody knows
that a hundred and fifty starving men, with scarce a round of ammunition
left, could not face five times their number perfectly armed, and
everybody who knows Mr. Washington knows that he (<font color='blue'><b>Washington</b></font>) would do his (<font color='blue'><b>Washington</b></font>) duty.
Harry and I saw the French in Canada last year. They obey but one will:
in our provinces each governor has his (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>) own. They were royal troops the
French sent against you...''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, but that some of ours were here!''  (<font color='red'><b>Madam Esmond/Madam Esmond Warrington/Madam Warrington</b></font>)</div>cries Madam Esmond, tossing her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>)
head up. <div class="bookquote">``I promise you a few good English regiments would make the
white-coats run.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You think nothing of the provincials: and I must say nothing now we
have been so unlucky,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Colonel</b></font>)</div>said the Colonel, gloomily. <div class="bookquote">``You made much of me
when I was here before. Don't you remember what victories you prophesied
for me--how much I boasted myself very likely over your good wine? All
those fine dreams are over now. `Tis kind of your ladyship to receive a
poor beaten fellow as you do:''  (<font color='red'><b>the soldier</b></font>)</div>and the young soldier hung down his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) head.

<p/>George Warrington, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) extreme acute sensibility, was touched at
the other's emotion and simple testimony of sorrow under defeat. He (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) was
about to say something friendly to Mr. Washington, had not his (<font color='blue'><b>Washington</b></font>) mother,
to whom the Colonel had been speaking, replied herself: <div class="bookquote">``Kind of us to
receive you, Colonel Washington!''  (<font color='red'><b>the Colonel</b></font>)</div>said the widow. <div class="bookquote">``I never heard that
when men were unhappy, our sex were less their friends.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) made the Colonel a very fine curtsey, which straightway caused
her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) son to be more jealous of him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) than ever.




<p/>CHAPTER VII. Preparations for War


<p/>Surely no man can have better claims to sympathy than bravery, youth,
good looks, and misfortune. Madam Esmond might have had twenty sons, and
yet had a right to admire her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) young soldier. Mr. Washington's room
was more than ever Mr. Washington's room now. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) raved about him (<font color='blue'><b>Washington</b></font>)
and praised him (<font color='blue'><b>Washington</b></font>) in all companies. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) more than ever pointed out his (<font color='blue'><b>Washington</b></font>)
excellences to her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) sons, contrasting his (<font color='blue'><b>Washington</b></font>) sterling qualities with Harry's
love of pleasure -LRB-the wild boy!-RRB- and George's listless musings over his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
books. George was not disposed to like Mr. Washington any better for
his (<font color='blue'><b>Washington</b></font>) mother's extravagant praises. He (<font color='blue'><b>Washington</b></font>) coaxed the jealous demon within him (<font color='blue'><b>Washington</b></font>)
until he (<font color='blue'><b>Washington</b></font>) must have become a perfect pest to himself and all the friends
round about him (<font color='blue'><b>Washington</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Washington</b></font>) uttered jokes so deep that his (<font color='blue'><b>Washington</b></font>) simple mother did not
know their meaning, but sate bewildered at his (<font color='blue'><b>Washington</b></font>) sarcasms, and powerless
what to think of his (<font color='blue'><b>Washington</b></font>) moody, saturnine humour.

<p/>Meanwhile, public events were occurring which were to influence the
fortunes of all our homely family. The quarrel between the French and
English North Americans, from being a provincial, had grown to be a
national, quarrel. Reinforcements from France had already arrived in
Canada; and English troops were expected in Virginia. <div class="bookquote">``Alas! my dear
friend!''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame</b></font>)</div>wrote Madame la Presidente de Mouchy, from Quebec, to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) young
friend George Warrington. <div class="bookquote">``How contrary is the destiny to us! I see you
quitting the embrace of an adored mother to precipitate yourself in the
arms of Bellona. I see you pass wounded after combats. I hesitate almost
to wish victory to our lilies when I behold you ranged under the
banners of the Leopard. There are enmities which the heart does not
recognise--ours assuredly are at peace among the tumults. All here love
and salute you, as well as Monsieur the Bear-hunter, your brother -LRB-that
cold Hippolyte who preferred the chase to the soft conversation of our
ladies!-RRB- Your friend, your enemy, the Chevalier de la Jabotiere, burns
to meet on the field of Mars his (<font color='blue'><b>Chevalier</b></font>) generous rival. M. Du Quesne spoke
of you last night at supper. M. Du Quesne, my husband, send affectuous
remembrances to their young friend, with which are ever joined those of
your sincere Presidente de Mouchy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The banner of the Leopard,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>of which George's fair correspondent wrote,
was, indeed, flung out to the winds, and a number of the king's soldiers
were rallied round it. It was resolved to wrest from the French all the
conquests they had made upon British dominion. A couple of regiments
were raised and paid by the king in America, and a fleet with a couple
more was despatched from home under an experienced commander. In
February, 1755, Commodore Keppel, in the famous ship Centurion, in which
Anson had made his (<font color='blue'><b>Anson</b></font>) voyage round the world, anchored in Hampton Roads
with two ships of war under his (<font color='blue'><b>Hampton</b></font>) command, and having on board General
Braddock, his (<font color='blue'><b>Braddock</b></font>) staff, and a part of his (<font color='blue'><b>Braddock</b></font>) troops. Mr. Braddock was
appointed by the Duke. A hundred years ago the Duke of Cumberland was
called The Duke par excellence in England--as another famous warrior has
since been called. Not so great a Duke certainly was that first-named
Prince as his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) party esteemed him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>), and surely not so bad a one as his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>)
enemies have painted him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>). A fleet of transports speedily followed Prince
William's general, bringing stores, and men, and money in plenty.

<p/>The great man landed his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) troops at Alexandria on the Potomac river, and
repaired to Annapolis in Maryland, where he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ordered the governors of the
different colonies to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in council, urging them each to call upon
their respective provinces to help the common cause in this strait.

<p/>The arrival of the General and his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) little army caused a mighty
excitement all through the provinces, and nowhere greater than at
Castlewood. Harry was off forthwith to see the troops under canvas at
Alexandria. The sight of their lines delighted him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), and the inspiring
music of their fifes and drums. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) speedily made acquaintance with the
officers of both regiments; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) longed to join in the expedition upon
which they were bound, and was a welcome guest at their mess.

<p/>Madam Esmond was pleased that her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) sons should have an opportunity of
enjoying the society of gentlemen of good fashion from England. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) had
no doubt their company was improving, that the English gentlemen were
very different from the horse-racing, cock-fighting Virginian
squires, with whom Master Harry would associate, and the lawyers, and
pettifoggers, and toad-eaters at the lieutenant-governor's table. Madam
Esmond had a very keen eye for detecting flatterers in other folks'
houses. Against the little knot of official people at Williamsburg she (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>)
was especially satirical, and had no patience with their etiquettes and
squabbles for precedence.

<p/>As for the company of the king's officers, Mr. Harry and his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) elder
brother both smiled at their mamma's compliments to the elegance and
propriety of the gentlemen of the camp. If the good lady had but known
all, if she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) could but have heard their jokes and the songs which they
sang over their wine and punch, if she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) could have seen the condition
of many of them as they were carried away to their lodgings, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) would
scarce have been so ready to recommend their company to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) sons. Men
and officers swaggered the country round, and frightened the peaceful
farm and village folk with their riot: the General raved and stormed
against his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) troops for their disorder; against the provincials for their
traitorous niggardliness; the soldiers took possession almost as of a
conquered country, they scorned the provincials, they insulted the wives
even of their Indian allies, who had come to join the English warriors,
upon their arrival in America, and to march with them against the
French. The General was compelled to forbid the Indian women his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>)
camp. Amazed and outraged their husbands retired, and but a few months
afterwards their services were lost to him (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>), when their aid would have
been most precious.

<p/>Some stories against the gentlemen of the camp, Madam Esmond might have
heard, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) would have none of them. Soldiers would be soldiers, that
everybody knew; those officers who came over to Castlewood on her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) son's
invitation were most polite gentlemen, and such indeed was the case. The
widow received them most graciously, and gave them the best sport the
country afforded. Presently, the General himself sent polite messages
to the mistress of Castlewood. His (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) father had served with hers under
the glorious Marlborough, and Colonel Esmond's name was still known and
respected in England. With her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) ladyship's permission, General Braddock
would have the honour of waiting upon her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) at Castlewood, and paying his (<font color='blue'><b>Braddock</b></font>)
respects to the daughter of so meritorious an officer.

<p/>If she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) had known the cause of Mr. Braddock's politeness, perhaps
his (<font color='blue'><b>Braddock</b></font>) compliments would not have charmed Madam Esmond so much. The
Commander-in-Chief held levees at Alexandria, and among the gentry of
the country, who paid him (<font color='blue'><b>gentry</b></font>) their respects, were our twins of Castlewood,
who mounted their best nags, took with them their last London suits,
and, with their two negro-boys, in smart liveries behind them, rode
in state to wait upon the great man. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was sulky and angry with the
provincial gentry, and scarce took any notice of the young gentlemen,
only asking, casually, of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) aide-de-camp at dinner, who the young
Squire Gawkeys were in blue and gold and red waistcoats?

<p/>Mr. Dinwiddie, the Lieutenant-Governor of Virginia, the Agent from
Pennsylvania, and a few more gentlemen, happened to be dining with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Agent</b></font>) Excellency. <div class="bookquote">``Oh!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Dinwiddie/Dinwiddie</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Dinwiddie, <div class="bookquote">``those are the sons of the
Princess Pocahontas;''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Dinwiddie/Dinwiddie</b></font>)</div>on which, with a tremendous oath, the General
asked, <div class="bookquote">``Who the deuce was she (<font color='blue'><b>Pocahontas</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the General</b></font>)</div><p/>Dinwiddie, who did not love her (<font color='blue'><b>Agent</b></font>), having indeed undergone a hundred
pertnesses from the imperious little lady, now gave a disrespectful and
ridiculous account of Madam Esmond, made merry with her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) pomposity and
immense pretensions, and entertained General Braddock with anecdotes
regarding her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>), until his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) Excellency fell asleep.

<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) awoke, Dinwiddie was gone, but the Philadelphia gentleman was
still at table, deep in conversation with the officers there present.
The General took up the talk where it had been left when he (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) fell asleep,
and spoke of Madam Esmond in curt, disrespectful terms, such as soldiers
were in the habit of using in those days, and asking, again, what was
the name of the old fool about whom Dinwiddie had been talking? He (<font color='blue'><b>Dinwiddie</b></font>) then
broke into expressions of contempt and wrath against the gentry, and the
country in general.

<p/>Mr. Franklin of Philadelphia repeated the widow's name, took quite
a different view of her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) character from that Mr. Dinwiddie had given,
seemed to know a good deal about her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>), her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) father, and her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) estate; as,
indeed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dinwiddie</b></font>) did about every man or subject which came under discussion;
explained to the General that Madam Esmond had beeves, and horses, and
stores in plenty, which might be very useful at the present juncture,
and recommended him (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) to conciliate her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) by all means. The General
had already made up his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) mind that Mr. Franklin was a very shrewd,
intelligent person, and graciously ordered an aide-de-camp to invite the
two young men to the next day's dinner. When they appeared he (<font color='blue'><b>Franklin</b></font>) was very
pleasant and good-natured; the gentlemen of the General's family made
much of them. They behaved, as became persons of their name, with
modesty and good-breeding; they returned home delighted with their
entertainment, nor was their mother less pleased at the civilities which
his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) Excellency had shown to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) boys. In reply to Braddock's message,
Madam Esmond penned a billet in her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) best style, acknowledging his (<font color='blue'><b>Braddock</b></font>)
politeness, and begging his (<font color='blue'><b>Braddock</b></font>) Excellency to fix the time when she (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) might
have the honour to receive him (<font color='blue'><b>Braddock</b></font>) at Castlewood.

<p/>We may be sure that the arrival of the army and the approaching campaign
formed the subject of continued conversation in the Castlewood family.
To make the campaign was the dearest wish of Harry's life. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
dreamed only of war and battle; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was for ever with the officers at
Williamsburg; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) scoured and cleaned and polished all the guns and
swords in the house; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) renewed the amusements of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) childhood, and had
the negroes under arms. His (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) mother, who had a gallant spirit, knew that
the time was come when one of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) boys must leave her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) and serve the
king. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) scarce dared to think on whom the lot should fall. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) admired
and respected the elder, but she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) loved the younger boy
with all the passion of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) heart.

<p/>Eager as Harry was to be a soldier, and with all his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) thoughts bent on
that glorious scheme, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) too scarcely dared to touch on the subject
nearest his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) heart. Once or twice when he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) ventured on it with George, the
latter's countenance wore an ominous look. Harry had a feudal attachment
for his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) elder brother, worshipped him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) with an extravagant regard, and in
all things gave way to him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) as the chief. So Harry saw, to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) infinite
terror, how George, too, in his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) grave way, was occupied with military
matters. George had the wars of Eugene and Marlborough down from his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
bookshelves, all the military books of his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) grandfather, and the most
warlike of Plutarch's lives. He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) and Dempster were practising with the
foils again. The old Scotchman was an adept in the military art, though
somewhat shy of saying where he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) learned it.

<p/>Madam Esmond made her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) two boys the bearers of the letter in reply to his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
Excellency's message, accompanying her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) note with such large and handsome
presents for the General's staff and the officers of the two Royal
Regiments, as caused the General more than once to thank Mr. Franklin
for having been the means of bringing this welcome ally into the camp.
<div class="bookquote">``Would not one of the young gentlemen like to see the campaign?''
 (<font color='red'><b>the General</b></font>)</div>the General asked. <div class="bookquote">``A friend of theirs, who often spoke of them--Mr.
Washington, who had been unlucky in the affair of last year--had already
promised to join him (<font color='blue'><b>Washington</b></font>) as aide-de-camp, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Washington</b></font>) Excellency would gladly
take another young Virginian gentleman into his (<font color='blue'><b>Washington</b></font>) family.''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>Harry's eyes
brightened and his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) face flushed at this offer. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Washington</b></font>) would like with all
his (<font color='blue'><b>Washington</b></font>) heart to go!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) cried out. George said, looking hard at his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) younger
brother, that one of them would be proud to attend his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) Excellency,
whilst it would be the other's duty to take care of their mother
at home. Harry allowed his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) senior to speak. His (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) will was even still
obedient to George's. However much he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) desired to go, he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) would not
pronounce until George had declared himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) longed so for the
campaign, that the actual wish made him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) timid. He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) dared not speak on the
matter as he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) went home with George. They rode for miles in silence, or
strove to talk upon indifferent subjects; each knowing what was passing
in the other's mind, and afraid to bring the awful question to an issue.

<p/>On their arrival at home the boys told their mother of General
Braddock's offer. <div class="bookquote">``I knew it must happen,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``at such a crisis
in the country our family must come forward. Have you--have you settled
yet which of you is to leave me?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) looked anxiously from one to
another, dreading to hear either name.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The youngest ought to go, mother; of course I ought to go!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>cries
Harry, turning very red.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course he (<font color='blue'><b>Washington</b></font>) ought,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Mountain/Mountain</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Mountain, who was present at their talk.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There! Mountain says so! I told you so!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>again cries Harry, with a
sidelong look at George.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The head of the family ought to go, mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>says George, sadly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No! no! you are ill, and have never recovered your fever. Ought he (<font color='blue'><b>Washington</b></font>) to
go, Mountain?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You would make the best soldier, I know that, dearest Hal. You and
George Washington are great friends, and could travel well together, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Washington</b></font>) does not care for me, nor I for him (<font color='blue'><b>Washington</b></font>), however much he (<font color='blue'><b>Washington</b></font>) is admired in
the family. But, you see, `tis the law of Honour, my Harry.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>-LRB-He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
here spoke to his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) brother with a voice of extraordinary kindness and
tenderness.-RRB- <div class="bookquote">``The grief I have had in this matter has been that I must
refuse thee. I must go. Had Fate given you the benefit of that extra
half-hour of life which I have had before you, it would have been your
lot, and you would have claimed your right to go first, you know you
would.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, George,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>said poor Harry, <div class="bookquote">``I own I should.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You will stay at home, and take care of Castlewood and our mother. If
anything happens to me, you are here to fill my place. I would like to
give way, my dear, as you, I know, would lay down your life to serve me.
But each of us must do his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) duty. What would our grandfather say if he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
were here?''

 (<font color='red'><b>The mother</b></font>)</div><p/>The mother looked proudly at her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) two sons. <div class="bookquote">``My papa would say that his (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>)
boys were gentlemen,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madam Esmond/Madam Esmond Warrington/Madam Warrington</b></font>)</div>faltered Madam Esmond, and left the young men, not
choosing, perhaps, to show the emotion which was filling her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) heart. It
was speedily known amongst the servants that Mr. George was going on the
campaign. Dinah, George's foster-mother, was loud in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) lamentations
at losing him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>); Phillis, Harry's old nurse, was as noisy because Master
George, as usual, was preferred over Master Harry. Sady, George's
servant, made preparations to follow his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) master, bragging incessantly
of the deeds which he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) would do, while Gumbo, Harry's boy, pretended to
whimper at being left behind, though, at home, Gumbo was anything but a
fire-eater.

<p/>But, of all in the house, Mrs. Mountain was the most angry at George's
determination to go on the campaign. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mountain</b></font>) had no patience with him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
did not know what he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) was doing by leaving home. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mountain</b></font>) begged, implored,
insisted that he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) should alter his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) determination; and vowed that nothing
but mischief would come from his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) departure.

<p/>George was surprised at the pertinacity of the good lady's opposition.
<div class="bookquote">``I know, Mountain,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``that Harry would be the better soldier;
but, after all, to go is my duty.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To stay is your duty!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>says Mountain, with a stamp of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) foot.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why did not my mother own it when we talked of the matter just now?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Your mother!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Mountain/Mountain</b></font>)</div>says Mrs. Mountain, with a most gloomy, sardonic laugh;
<div class="bookquote">``your mother, my poor child!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Mountain/Mountain</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What is the meaning of that mournful countenance, Mountain?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It may be that your mother wishes you away, George!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Mountain/Mountain</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Mountain
continued, wagging her (<font color='blue'><b>Mountain</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``It may be, my poor deluded boy, that you
will find a father-in-law when you come back.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What in heaven do you mean?''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>cried George, the blood rushing into his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you suppose I have no eyes, and cannot see what is going on? I tell
you, child, that Colonel Washington wants a rich wife. When you are
gone, he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) will ask your mother to marry him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>), and you will find him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) master
here when you come back. That is why you ought not to go away, you poor,
unhappy, simple boy! Don't you see how fond she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) is of him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)? how much
she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) makes of him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)? how she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) is always holding him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) up to you, to Harry, to
everybody who comes here?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) is going on the campaign, too,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>cried George.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) is going on the marrying campaign, child!''  (<font color='red'><b>the widow</b></font>)</div>insisted the widow.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay; General Braddock himself told me that Mr. Washington had accepted
the appointment of aide-de-camp.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``An artifice! an artifice to blind you, my poor child!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>cries Mountain.
<div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Washington</b></font>) will be wounded and come back--you will see if he (<font color='blue'><b>Washington</b></font>) does not. I have
proofs of what I say to you--proofs under his (<font color='blue'><b>Washington</b></font>) own hand--look here!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And
she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) took from her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) pocket a piece of paper in Mr. Washington's well-known
handwriting.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How came you by this paper?''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>asked George, turning ghastly pale.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I--I found it in the Major's chamber!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Mountain/Mountain</b></font>)</div>says Mrs. Mountain, with a
shamefaced look.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You read the private letters of a guest staying in our house?''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>cried
George. <div class="bookquote">``For shame! I will not look at the paper!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) flung it from
him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) on to the fire before him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I could not help it, George; `twas by chance, I give you my word, by
the merest chance. You know Governor Dinwiddie is to have the Major's
room, and the state-room is got ready for Mr. Braddock, and we are
expecting ever so much company, and I had to take the things which
the Major leaves here--he (<font color='blue'><b>Braddock</b></font>) treats the house just as if it was his (<font color='blue'><b>Braddock</b></font>) own
already--into his (<font color='blue'><b>Braddock</b></font>) new room, and this half-sheet of paper fell out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Braddock</b></font>)
writing-book, and I just gave one look at it by the merest chance, and
when I saw what it was it was my duty to read it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, you are a martyr to duty, Mountain!''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>George said grimly. <div class="bookquote">``I dare
say Mrs. Bluebeard thought it was her (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) duty to look through the keyhole.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I never did look through the keyhole, George. It's a shame you should
say so! I, who have watched, and tended, and nursed you, like a mother;
who have sate up whole weeks with you in fevers, and carried you from
your bed to the sofa in these arms. There, sir, I don't want you there
now. My dear Mountain, indeed! Don't tell me! You fly into a passion,
and, call names, and wound my feelings, who have loved you like your
mother--like your mother?--I only hope she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) may love you half as well. I
say you are all ungrateful. My Mr. Mountain was a wretch, and every one
of you is as bad.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Mountain/Mountain</b></font>)</div><p/>There was but a smouldering log or two in the fireplace, and no doubt
Mountain saw that the paper was in no danger as it lay amongst the
ashes, or she (<font color='blue'><b>Mountain</b></font>) would have seized it at the risk of burning her (<font color='blue'><b>Mountain</b></font>) own
fingers, and ere she (<font color='blue'><b>Mountain</b></font>) uttered the above passionate defence of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mountain</b></font>)
conduct. Perhaps George was absorbed in his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) dismal thoughts; perhaps
his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) jealousy overpowered him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>), for he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) did not resist any further when she (<font color='blue'><b>Mountain</b></font>)
stooped down and picked up the paper.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You should thank your stars, child, that I saved the letter,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>cried
she (<font color='blue'><b>Mountain</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``See! here are his (<font color='blue'><b>Mountain</b></font>) own words, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mountain</b></font>) great big handwriting like
a clerk. It was not my fault that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mountain</b></font>) wrote them, or that I found them.
Read for yourself, I say, George Warrington, and be thankful that your
poor dear old Mounty is watching over you!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Every word and letter upon the unlucky paper was perfectly clear.
George's eyes could not help taking in the contents of the document
before him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Not a word of this, Mountain,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) said, giving her (<font color='blue'><b>Mountain</b></font>) a
frightful look. <div class="bookquote">``I--I will return this paper to Mr. Washington.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Mountain/Mountain</b></font>)</div><p/>Mountain was scared at his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) face, at the idea of what she (<font color='blue'><b>Mountain</b></font>) had done, and
what might ensue. When his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) mother, with alarm in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) countenance, asked
him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) at dinner what ailed him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) looked so pale? <div class="bookquote">``Do you suppose,
madam,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>says he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>), filling himself a great bumper of wine, <div class="bookquote">``that to leave
such a tender mother as you does not cause me cruel grief?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The good lady could not understand his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) words, his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) strange, fierce looks,
and stranger laughter. He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) bantered all at the table; called to the
servants and laughed at them, and drank more and more. Each time the
door was opened, he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) turned towards it; and so did Mountain, with a
guilty notion that Mr. Washington would step in.




<p/>CHAPTER VIII. In which George suffers from a Common Disease


<p/>On the day appointed for Madam Esmond's entertainment to the General,
the house of Castlewood was set out with the greatest splendour; and
Madam Esmond arrayed herself in a much more magnificent dress than she (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>)
was accustomed to wear. Indeed, she (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) wished to do every honour to her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>)
guest, and to make the entertainment--which, in reality, was a sad
one to her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>)--as pleasant as might be for her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) company. The General's new
aide-de-camp was the first to arrive. The widow received him (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) in the
covered gallery before the house. He (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) dismounted at the steps, and
his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) servants led away his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) horses to the well-known quarters. No young
gentleman in the colony was better mounted or a better horseman than Mr.
Washington.

<p/>For a while ere the Major retired to divest himself of his (<font color='blue'><b>Washington</b></font>) riding-boots,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Washington</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Washington</b></font>) hostess paced the gallery in talk. She (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>) had much to say to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Washington</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>) had to hear from him (<font color='blue'><b>Washington</b></font>) a confirmation of his (<font color='blue'><b>Washington</b></font>) own appointment as
aide-de-camp to General Braddock, and to speak of her (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>) son's approaching
departure. The negro servants bearing the dishes for the approaching
feast were passing perpetually as they talked. They descended the steps
down to the rough lawn in front of the house, and paced a while in the
shade. Mr. Washington announced his (<font color='blue'><b>Washington</b></font>) Excellency's speedy approach, with
Mr. Franklin of Pennsylvania in his (<font color='blue'><b>Washington</b></font>) coach.

<p/>This Mr. Franklin had been a common printer's boy, Mrs. Esmond had
heard; a pretty pass things were coming to when such persons rode in the
coach of the Commander-in-Chief! Mr. Washington said, a more shrewd and
sensible gentleman never rode in coach or walked on foot. Mrs. Esmond
thought the Major was too liberally disposed towards this gentleman; but
Mr. Washington stoutly maintained against the widow that the printer was
a most ingenious, useful, and meritorious man.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am glad, at least, that, as my boy is going to make the campaign, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
will not be with tradesmen, but with gentlemen, with gentlemen of honour
and fashion,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madam Esmond/Madam Esmond Warrington/Madam Warrington</b></font>)</div>says Madam Esmond, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) most stately manner.

<p/>Mr. Washington had seen the gentlemen of honour and fashion over their
cups, and perhaps thought that all their sayings and doings were not
precisely such as would tend to instruct or edify a young man on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
entrance into life; but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wisely chose to tell no tales out of school,
and said that Harry and George, now they were coming into the world,
must take their share of good and bad, and hear what both sorts had to
say.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``To be with a veteran officer of the finest army in the world,''  (<font color='red'><b>the widow</b></font>)</div>faltered
the widow; <div class="bookquote">``with gentlemen who have been bred in the midst of the Court;
with friends of his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) Royal Highness, the Duke--''

 (<font color='red'><b>the widow</b></font>)</div><p/>The widow's friend only inclined his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) head. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) did not choose to allow
his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) countenance to depart from its usual handsome gravity.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And with you, dear Colonel Washington, by whom my father always set
such store. You don't know how much he (<font color='blue'><b>Washington</b></font>) trusted in you. You will take
care of my boy, sir, will not you? You are but five years older, yet
I trust to you more than to his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) seniors; my father always told the
children, I alway bade them, to look up to Mr. Washington.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You know I would have done anything to win Colonel Esmond's favour.
Madam, how much would I not venture to merit his (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) daughter's?''

 (<font color='red'><b>The gentleman</b></font>)</div><p/>The gentleman bowed with not too ill a grace. The lady blushed,
and dropped one of the lowest curtsies. -LRB-Madam Esmond's curtsey was
considered unrivalled over the whole province.-RRB- <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Washington,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>)
said, <div class="bookquote">``will be always sure of a mother's affection, whilst he (<font color='blue'><b>Washington</b></font>) gives so
much of his (<font color='blue'><b>Washington</b></font>) to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) children.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And so saying she (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) gave him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) hand, which
he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) kissed with profound politeness. The little lady presently re-entered
her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) mansion, leaning upon the tall young officer's arm. Here they were
joined by George, who came to them, accurately powdered and richly
attired, saluting his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) parent and his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) friend alike with low and
respectful bows. Nowadays, a young man walks into his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mother's room with
hobnailed high-lows, and a wideawake on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head; and instead of making
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) a bow, puffs a cigar into her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) face.

<p/>But George, though he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) made the lowest possible bow to Mr. Washington and
his (<font color='blue'><b>Washington</b></font>) mother, was by no means in good-humour with either of them. A
polite smile played round the lower part of his (<font color='blue'><b>Washington</b></font>) countenance, whilst
watchfulness and wrath glared out from the two upper windows. What had
been said or done? Nothing that might not have been performed or uttered
before the most decent, polite, or pious company. Why then should Madam
Esmond continue to blush, and the brave Colonel to look somewhat red, as
he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) young friend's hand?

<p/>The Colonel asked Mr. George if he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) had had good sport? <div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>says
George, curtly. <div class="bookquote">``Have you?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And then he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) looked at the picture of his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
father, which hung in the parlour.

<p/>The Colonel, not a talkative man ordinarily, straightway entered into
a long description of his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) sport, and described where he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) had been in the
morning, and what woods he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) had hunted with the king's officers; how many
birds they had shot, and what game they had brought down. Though not
a jocular man ordinarily, the Colonel made a long description of Mr.
Braddock's heavy person and great boots, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) floundered through
the Virginian woods, hunting, as they called it, with a pack of dogs
gathered from various houses, with a pack of negroes barking as loud as
the dogs, and actually shooting the deer when they came in sight of him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``Great God, sir!''  (<font color='red'><b>Braddock/Mr. Braddock</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Braddock, puffing and blowing, <div class="bookquote">``what
would Sir Robert have said in Norfolk, to see a man hunting with a
fowling-piece in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand, and a pack of dogs actually laid on to a
turkey!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Braddock/Mr. Braddock</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed, Colonel, you are vastly comical this afternoon!''  (<font color='red'><b>Madam Esmond/Madam Esmond Warrington/Madam Warrington</b></font>)</div>cries Madam
Esmond, with a neat little laugh, whilst her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) son listened to the story,
looking more glum than ever. <div class="bookquote">``What Sir Robert is there at Norfolk? Is he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>)
one of the newly arrived army-gentlemen?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The General meant Norfolk at home, madam, not Norfolk in Virginia,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Colonel</b></font>)</div>said Colonel Washington. <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Braddock had been talking of a visit to
Sir Robert Walpole, who lived in that county, and of the great hunts the
old Minister kept there, and of his (<font color='blue'><b>Minister</b></font>) grand palace, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Minister</b></font>) pictures at
Houghton. I should like to see a good field and a good fox-chase at home
better than any sight in the world,''  (<font color='red'><b>the sportsman</b></font>)</div>the honest sportsman added with a
sigh.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nevertheless, there is good sport here, as I was saying,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>said young
Esmond, with a sneer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What sport?''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>cries the other, looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, sure you know, without looking at me so fiercely, and stamping
your foot, as if you were going to charge me with the foils. Are you not
the best sportsman of the country-side? Are there not all the fish
of the field, and the beasts of the trees, and the fowls of the
sea--no--the fish of the trees, and the beasts of the sea--and the--bah!
You know what I mean. I mean shad, and salmon, and rock-fish, and
roe-deer, and hogs, and buffaloes, and bisons, and elephants, for what I
know. I'm no sportsman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, indeed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Washington/Washington</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Washington, with a look of scarcely repressed
scorn.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I understand you. I am a milksop. I have been bred at my mamma's
knee. Look at these pretty apron-strings, Colonel! Who would not like to

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And who would not mourn for such a gentleman?''  (<font color='red'><b>the Colonel</b></font>)</div>said the Colonel, as the

her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) second son entered the room--in just such another suit, gold-corded
frock, braided waistcoat, silver-hilted sword, and solitaire, as that
which his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) elder brother wore. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, Harry, Harry!''  (<font color='red'><b>Madam Esmond/Madam Esmond Warrington/Madam Warrington</b></font>)</div>cries Madam Esmond,
and flies to her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) younger son.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is it, mother?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>asks Harry, taking her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) arms. <div class="bookquote">``What is the
matter, Colonel?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Upon my life, it would puzzle me to say,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Colonel</b></font>)</div>answered the Colonel, biting
his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) lips.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A mere question, Hal, about pink ribbons, which I think vastly becoming
to our mother; as, no doubt, the Colonel does.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sir, will you please to speak for yourself?''  (<font color='red'><b>the Colonel</b></font>)</div>cried the Colonel,
bustling up, and then sinking his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) voice again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) speaks too much for himself,''  (<font color='red'><b>the widow</b></font>)</div>wept the widow.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I protest I don't any more know the source of these tears, than the
source of the Nile,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>said George, <div class="bookquote">``and if the picture of my father were
to begin to cry, I should almost as much wonder at the paternal tears.
What have I uttered? An allusion to ribbons! Is there some poisoned pin
in them, which has been struck into my mother's heart by a guilty fiend
of a London mantua-maker? I professed to wish to be led in these lovely
reins all my life long,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) turned a pirouette on his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) scarlet heels.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``George Warrington! what devil's dance are you dancing now?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>asked
Harry, who loved his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) mother, who loved Mr. Washington, but who, of all
creatures, loved and admired his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) brother George.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear child, you do not understand dancing--you care not for the
politer arts--you can get no more music out of a spinet than by pulling
a dead hog by the ear. By nature you were made for a man--a man of
war--I do not mean a seventy-four, Colonel George, like that hulk which
brought the hulking Mr. Braddock into our river. His (<font color='blue'><b>Braddock</b></font>) Excellency, too,
is a man of warlike turn, a follower of the sports of the field. I am a
milksop, as I have had the honour to say.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You never showed it yet. You beat that great Maryland man was twice
your size,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>breaks out Harry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Under compulsion, Harry. `Tis tuptu, my lad, or else `tis tuptomai, as
thy breech well knew when we followed school. But I am of a quiet turn,
and would never lift my hand to pull a trigger, no, nor a nose, nor
anything but a rose,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and here he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) took and handled one of Madam Esmond's
bright pink apron ribbons. <div class="bookquote">``I hate sporting, which you and the Colonel
love, and I want to shoot nothing alive, not a turkey, nor a titmouse,
nor an ox, nor an ass, nor anything that has ears. Those curls of Mr.
Washington's are prettily powdered.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The militia colonel</b></font>)</div><p/>The militia colonel, who had been offended by the first part of the
talk, and very much puzzled by the last, had taken a modest draught from
the great china bowl of apple-toddy which stood to welcome the guests
in this as in all Virginian houses, and was further cooling himself by
pacing the balcony in a very stately manner.

<p/>Again almost reconciled with the elder, the appeased mother stood giving
a hand to each of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) sons. George put his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) disengaged hand on Harry's
shoulder. <div class="bookquote">``I say one thing, George,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>says he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) with a flushing face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Say twenty things, Don Enrico,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>cries the other.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you are not fond of sporting and that, and don't care for killing
game and hunting, being cleverer than me, why shouldst thou not stop
at home and be quiet, and let me go out with Colonel George and Mr.
Braddock?--that's what I say,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>says Harry, delivering himself of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
speech.

<p/>The widow looked eagerly from the dark-haired to the fair-haired boy.
She (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) knew not from which she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) would like to part.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``One of our family must go because honneur oblige, and my name being
number one, number one must go first,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>says George.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Told you so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>said poor Harry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``One must stay, or who is to look after mother at home? We cannot afford
to be both scalped by Indians or fricasseed by French.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Fricasseed by French!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>cries Harry; <div class="bookquote">``the best troops of the world!
Englishmen! I should like to see them fricasseed by the French!--What a
mortal thrashing you will give them!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>and the brave lad sighed to think
he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) should not be present at the battue.

<p/>George sate down to the harpsichord and played and sang <div class="bookquote">``Malbrouk s'en
va-t-en guerre, Mironton, mironton, mirontaine,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>at the sound of which
music the gentleman from the balcony entered. <div class="bookquote">``I am playing `God save
the King,' Colonel, in compliment to the new expedition.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I never know whether thou art laughing or in earnest,''  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman methinks</b></font>)</div>said the simple
gentleman, <div class="bookquote">``but surely methinks that is not the air.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman methinks</b></font>)</div><p/>George performed ever so many trills and quavers upon his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) harpsichord,
and their guest watched him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>), wondering, perhaps, that a gentleman of
George's condition could set himself to such an effeminate business.
Then the Colonel took out his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) watch, saying that his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) Excellency's coach
would be here almost immediately, and asking leave to retire to his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>)
apartment, and put himself in a fit condition to appear before her (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
ladyship's company.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Colonel Washington knows the way to his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) room pretty well,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>said George,
from the harpsichord, looking over his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) shoulder, but never offering to
stir.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let me show the Colonel to his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) chamber,''  (<font color='red'><b>the widow</b></font>)</div>cried the widow, in great
wrath, and sailed out of the apartment, followed by the enraged and
bewildered Colonel, as George continued crashing among the keys. Her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>)
high-spirited guest felt himself insulted, he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) could hardly say how; he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
was outraged and he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) could not speak; he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) was almost stifling with anger.

<p/>Harry Warrington remarked their friend's condition. <div class="bookquote">``For heaven's sake,
George, what does this all mean?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) asked his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) brother. <div class="bookquote">``Why shouldn't
he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) kiss her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) hand?''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>-LRB-George had just before fetched out his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) brother from
their library, to watch this harmless salute.-RRB- <div class="bookquote">``I tell you it is nothing
but common kindness.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing but common kindness!''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>shrieked out George. <div class="bookquote">``Look at that, Hal!
Is that common kindness?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) showed his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) junior the unlucky paper
over which he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) had been brooding for some time. It was but a fragment,
though the meaning was indeed clear without the preceding text.

<p/>The paper commenced: <div class="bookquote">``... is older than myself, but I, again, am older
than my years; and you know, dear brother, have ever been considered a
sober person. All children are better for a father's superintendence,

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Friend and guardian! Curse him (<font color='blue'><b>Friend</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>shrieked out George, clenching his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
fists--and his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) brother read on:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``... The flattering offer which General Braddock hath made me, will, of
course, oblige me to postpone this matter until after the campaign. When
we have given the French a sufficient drubbing, I shall return to repose
under my own vine and fig-tree.''

 (<font color='red'><b>brother</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Braddock</b></font>) means Castlewood. These are his (<font color='blue'><b>Braddock</b></font>) vines,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>George cries again, shaking
his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) fist at the creepers sunning themselves on the wall.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``... Under my own vine and fig-tree; where I hope soon to present my
dear brother to his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) new sister-in-law. She (<font color='blue'><b>sister-in-law</b></font>) has a pretty Scripture name,
which is...'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--and here the document ended.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Which is Rachel,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>George went on bitterly. <div class="bookquote">``Rachel is by no means
weeping for her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) children, and has every desire to be comforted. Now,
Harry! Let us upstairs at once, kneel down as becomes us, and say, `Dear

<p/>CHAPTER IX. Hospitalities


<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) Excellency the Commander-in-Chief set forth to pay his (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) visit to
Madam Esmond in such a state and splendour as became the first personage
in all his (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) Majesty's colonies, plantations, and possessions of North
America. His (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) guard of dragoons preceded him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) out of Williamsburg in the
midst of an immense shouting and yelling of a loyal, and principally
negro, population. The General rode in his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) own coach. Captain Talmadge,
his (<font color='blue'><b>Talmadge</b></font>) Excellency's Master of the Horse, attended him (<font color='blue'><b>Talmadge</b></font>) at the door of the
ponderous emblazoned vehicle, and riding by the side of the carriage
during the journey from Williamsburg to Madam Esmond's house. Major
Danvers, aide-de-camp, sate in the front of the carriage with the little
postmaster from Philadelphia, Mr. Franklin, who, printer's boy as he (<font color='blue'><b>Franklin</b></font>) had
been, was a wonderful shrewd person, as his (<font color='blue'><b>Franklin</b></font>) Excellency and the gentlemen
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Franklin</b></font>) family were fain to acknowledge, having a quantity of the most
curious information respecting the colony, and regarding England too,
where Mr. Franklin had been more than once. ```Twas extraordinary how
a person of such humble origin should have acquired such a variety
of learning and such a politeness of breeding too, Mr. Franklin!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
Excellency was pleased to observe, touching his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) hat graciously to the
postmaster.

<p/>The postmaster bowed, said it had been his (<font color='blue'><b>postmaster</b></font>) occasional good fortune to
fall into the company of gentlemen like his (<font color='blue'><b>postmaster</b></font>) Excellency, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>postmaster</b></font>) had
taken advantage of his (<font color='blue'><b>postmaster</b></font>) opportunity to study their honours' manners, and
adapt himself to them as far as he (<font color='blue'><b>postmaster</b></font>) might. As for education, he (<font color='blue'><b>postmaster</b></font>) could not
boast much of that--his (<font color='blue'><b>postmaster</b></font>) father being but in straitened circumstances,
and the advantages small in his (<font color='blue'><b>postmaster</b></font>) native country of New England: but he (<font color='blue'><b>postmaster</b></font>)
had done to the utmost of his (<font color='blue'><b>postmaster</b></font>) power, and gathered what he (<font color='blue'><b>postmaster</b></font>) could--he (<font color='blue'><b>postmaster</b></font>) knew
nothing like what they had in England.

<p/>Mr. Braddock burst out laughing, and said, <div class="bookquote">``As for education, there were
gentlemen of the army, by George, who didn't know whether they should
spell bull with two b's or one. He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) had heard the Duke of Marlborough
was no special good penman. He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) had not the honour of serving under that
noble commander--his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) Grace was before his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) time--but he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) thrashed the
French soundly, although he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) was no scholar.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Braddock/Mr. Braddock</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Franklin said he (<font color='blue'><b>Franklin</b></font>) was aware of both those facts.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nor is my Duke a scholar,''  (<font color='red'><b>Braddock/Mr. Braddock</b></font>)</div>went on Mr. Braddock--<div class="bookquote">``aha, Mr. Postmaster,
you have heard that, too--I see by the wink in your eye.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Braddock/Mr. Braddock</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Franklin instantly withdrew the obnoxious or satirical wink in his (<font color='blue'><b>Franklin</b></font>)
eye, and looked in the General's jolly round face with a pair of orbs as
innocent as a baby's. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>)'s no scholar, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) is a match for any French
general that ever swallowed the English for fricassee de crapaud.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) saved the crown for the best of kings, his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) royal father, his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) Most
Gracious Majesty King George.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Franklin</b></font>)</div><p/>Off went Mr. Franklin's hat, and from his (<font color='blue'><b>Franklin</b></font>) large buckled wig escaped a
great halo of powder.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) is the soldier's best friend, and has been the uncompromising enemy
of all beggarly red-shanked Scotch rebels and intriguing Romish Jesuits
who would take our liberty from us, and our religion, by George. His (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
Royal Highness, my gracious master, is not a scholar neither, but he (<font color='blue'><b>scholar</b></font>) is
one of the finest gentlemen in the world.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have seen his (<font color='blue'><b>scholar</b></font>) Royal Highness on horseback, at a review of the Guards,
in Hyde Park,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Franklin</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Franklin. <div class="bookquote">``The Duke is indeed a very fine
gentleman on horseback.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You shall drink his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) health to-day, Postmaster. He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) is the best of
masters, the best of friends, the best of sons to his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) royal old father;
the best of gentlemen that ever wore an epaulet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Epaulets are quite out of my way, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Franklin</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Franklin, laughing.
<div class="bookquote">``You know I live in a Quaker City.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course they are out of your way, my good friend. Every man to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
business. You, and gentlemen of your class, to your books, and welcome.
We don't forbid you; we encourage you. We, to fight the enemy and govern
the country. Hey, gentlemen? Lord! what roads you have in this colony,
and how this confounded coach plunges! Who have we here, with the two
negro boys in livery? He (<font color='blue'><b>negro</b></font>) rides a good gelding.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is Mr. Washington,''  (<font color='red'><b>the aide-de-camp</b></font>)</div>says the aide-de-camp.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I would like him (<font color='blue'><b>Washington</b></font>) for a corporal of the Horse Grenadiers,''  (<font color='red'><b>the General</b></font>)</div>said the
General. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Washington</b></font>) has a good figure on a horse. He (<font color='blue'><b>Washington</b></font>) knows the country too, Mr.
Franklin.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, indeed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And is a monstrous genteel young man, considering the opportunities he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
has had. I should have thought he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had the polish of Europe, by George I
should.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) does his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) best,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Franklin</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Franklin, looking innocently at the stout
chief, the exemplar of English elegance, who sat swagging from one side
to the other of the carriage, his (<font color='blue'><b>Franklin</b></font>) face as scarlet as his (<font color='blue'><b>Franklin</b></font>) coat--swearing
at every other word; ignorant on every point off parade, except the
merits of a bottle and the looks of a woman; not of high birth, yet
absurdly proud of his (<font color='blue'><b>Franklin</b></font>) no-ancestry; brave as a bulldog; savage, lustful,
prodigal, generous; gentle in soft moods; easy of love and laughter;
dull of wit; utterly unread; believing his (<font color='blue'><b>Franklin</b></font>) country the first in the
world, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Franklin</b></font>) as good a gentleman as any in it. <div class="bookquote">``Yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) is mighty well
for a provincial, upon my word. He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) was beat at Fort What-d’ye-call-um
last year, down by the Thingamy river. What's the name on't, Talmadge?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The Lord knows, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Talmadge</b></font>)</div>says Talmadge; <div class="bookquote">``and I dare say the Postmaster,
too, who is laughing at us both.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Talmadge</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Captain!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Was caught in a regular trap. He (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) had only militia and Indians with him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>).
Good day, Mr. Washington. A pretty nag, sir. That was your first affair,
last year?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That at Fort Necessity? Yes, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>said the gentleman, gravely
saluting, as he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) rode up, followed by a couple of natty negro grooms,
in smart livery-coats and velvet hunting-caps. <div class="bookquote">``I began ill, sir, never
having been in action until that unlucky day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You were all raw levies, my good fellow. You should have seen our
militia run from the Scotch, and be cursed to them. You should have had
some troops with you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Your Excellency knows `tis my passionate desire to see and serve with
them,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Washington/Washington</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Washington.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``By George, we shall try and gratify you, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>the General</b></font>)</div>said the General, with
one of his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) usual huge oaths; and on the heavy carriage rolled towards
Castlewood; Mr. Washington asking leave to gallop on ahead, in order to
announce his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) Excellency's speedy arrival to the lady there.

<p/>The progress of the Commander-in-Chief was so slow, that several
humbler persons who were invited to meet his (<font color='blue'><b>Commander-in-Chief</b></font>) Excellency came up with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Commander-in-Chief</b></font>) carriage, and, not liking to pass the great man on the road, formed
quite a procession in the dusty wake of his (<font color='blue'><b>Commander-in-Chief</b></font>) chariot-wheels. First
came Mr. Dinwiddie, the Lieutenant-Governor of his (<font color='blue'><b>Dinwiddie</b></font>) Majesty's province,
attended by his (<font color='blue'><b>Dinwiddie</b></font>) negro servants, and in company of Parson Broadbent, the
jolly Williamsburg chaplain. These were presently joined by little Mr.
Dempster, the young gentlemen's schoolmaster, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Dempster</b></font>) great Ramillies
wig, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Dempster</b></font>) kept for occasions of state. Anon appeared Mr. Laws, the
judge of the court, with Madam Laws on a pillion behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Laws</b></font>), and their
negro man carrying a box containing her (<font color='blue'><b>Dempster</b></font>) ladyship's cap, and bestriding
a mule. The procession looked so ludicrous, that Major Danvers and Mr.
Franklin espying it, laughed outright, though not so loud as to disturb
his (<font color='blue'><b>Danvers</b></font>) Excellency, who was asleep by this time, bade the whole of this
queer rearguard move on, and leave the Commander-in-Chief and his (<font color='blue'><b>Commander-in-Chief</b></font>)
escort of dragoons to follow at their leisure. There was room for all at
Castlewood when they came. There was meat, drink, and the best tobacco
for his (<font color='blue'><b>Commander-in-Chief</b></font>) Majesty's soldiers; and laughing and jollity for the negroes;
and a plenteous welcome for their masters.

<p/>The honest General required to be helped to most dishes at the table,
and more than once, and was for ever holding out his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) glass for drink;
Nathan's sangaree he (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) pronounced to be excellent, and had drunk largely
of it on arriving before dinner. There was cider, ale, brandy, and
plenty of good Bordeaux wine, some which Colonel Esmond himself had
brought home with him (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) to the colony, and which was fit for ponteeficis
coenis, said little Mr. Dempster, with a wink to Mr. Broadbent, the
clergyman of the adjoining parish. Mr. Broadbent returned the wink and
nod, and drank the wine without caring about the Latin, as why should
he (<font color='blue'><b>Broadbent</b></font>), never having hitherto troubled himself about the language? Mr.
Broadbent was a gambling, guzzling, cock-fighting divine, who had passed
much time in the Fleet Prison, at Newmarket, at Hockley-in-the-Hole; and
having gone of all sorts of errands for his (<font color='blue'><b>Broadbent</b></font>) friend, Lord Cingbars,
Lord Ringwood's son -LRB-my Lady Cingbars's waiting-woman being Mr. B.'s
mother--I dare say the modern reader had best not be too particular
regarding Mr. Broadbent's father's pedigree-RRB-, had been of late sent out
to a church-living in Virginia. He (<font color='blue'><b>Broadbent</b></font>) and young George had fought many
a match of cocks together, taken many a roe in company, hauled in
countless quantities of shad and salmon, slain wild geese and wild
swans, pigeons and plovers, and destroyed myriads of canvas-backed
ducks. It was said by the envious that Broadbent was the midnight
poacher on whom Mr. Washington set his (<font color='blue'><b>Washington</b></font>) dogs, and whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Washington</b></font>) caned by the
river-side at Mount Vernon. The fellow got away from his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) captor's grip,
and scrambled to his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) boat in the dark; but Broadbent was laid up for
two Sundays afterwards, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Broadbent</b></font>) came abroad again had the evident
remains of a black eye and a new collar to his (<font color='blue'><b>Broadbent</b></font>) coat. All the games
at the cards had George Esmond and Parson Broadbent played together,
besides hunting all the birds in the air, the beasts in the forest, and
the fish of the sea. Indeed, when the boys rode together to get their
reading with Mr. Dempster, I suspect that Harry stayed behind and
took lessons from the other professor of European learning and
accomplishments,--George going his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) own way, reading his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) own books, and,
of course, telling no tales of his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) younger brother.

<p/>All the birds of the Virginia air, and all the fish of the sea in season
were here laid on Madam Esmond's board to feed his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) Excellency and the
rest of the English and American gentlemen. The gumbo was declared to be
perfection -LRB-young Mr. George's black servant was named after this
dish, being discovered behind the door with his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) head in a bowl of this
delicious hotch-potch, by the late Colonel, and grimly christened on the
spot-RRB-, the shad were rich and fresh, the stewed terrapins were worthy of
London aldermen -LRB-before George, he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) would like the Duke himself to taste
them, his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) Excellency deigned to say-RRB-, and indeed, stewed terrapins are
worthy of any duke or even emperor. The negro-women have a genius for
cookery, and in Castlewood kitchens there were adepts in the art brought
up under the keen eye of the late and the present Madam Esmond. Certain
of the dishes, especially the sweets and flan, Madam Esmond prepared
herself with great neatness and dexterity; carving several of the
principal pieces, as the kindly cumbrous fashion of the day was, putting
up the laced lappets of her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) sleeves, and showing the prettiest round
arms and small hands and wrists as she (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) performed this ancient rite of
a hospitality not so languid as ours. The old law of the table was that
the mistress was to press her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) guests with a decent eagerness, to watch
and see whom she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) could encourage to further enjoyment, to know culinary
anatomic secrets, and execute carving operations upon fowls, fish, game,
joints of meat, and so forth; to cheer her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) guests to fresh efforts, to
whisper her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) neighbour, Mr. Braddock <div class="bookquote">``I have kept for your Excellency
the jowl of this salmon.--I will take no denial! Mr. Franklin, you drink
only water, sir, though our cellar has wholesome wine which gives no
headaches.--Mr. Justice, you love woodcock pie?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Braddock/Mr. Braddock</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because I know who makes the pastry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Laws</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Laws, the judge, with
a profound bow. ``I wish, madam, we had such a happy knack of pastry at
home as you have at Castlewood. I often say to my wife, `My dear, I wish
you had Madam Esmond's hand.'''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is a very pretty hand; I am sure others would like it too,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>says Mr.
Postmaster of Boston, at which remark Mr. Esmond looks but half-pleased
at the little gentleman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Such a hand for a light pie-crust,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Judge service</b></font>)</div>continues the Judge, <div class="bookquote">``and
my service to you, madam.''  (<font color='red'><b>the Judge service</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) thinks the widow cannot but be
propitiated by this compliment. She (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) says simply that she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) had lessons
when she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) was at home in England for her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) education, and that there were
certain dishes which her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) mother taught her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) to make, and which her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) father
and sons both liked. She (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) was very glad if they pleased her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) company. More
such remarks follow: more dishes; ten times as much meat as is
needful for the company. Mr. Washington does not embark in the general
conversation much, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Washington</b></font>) and Mr. Talmadge, and Major Danvers, and
the Postmaster, are deep in talk about roads, rivers, conveyances,
sumpter-horses and artillery train; and the provincial militia Colonel
has bits of bread laid at intervals on the table before him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>), and
stations marked out, on which he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) has his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) finger, and regarding which he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>)
is talking to his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) brother aides-de-camp, till a negro servant, changing
the courses, brushes off the Potomac with a napkin, and sweeps up the
Ohio in a spoon.

<p/>At the end of dinner, Mr. Broadbent leaves his (<font color='blue'><b>Broadbent</b></font>) place and walks up behind
the Lieutenant-Governor's chair, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Broadbent</b></font>) says grace, returning to his (<font color='blue'><b>Broadbent</b></font>)
seat and resuming his (<font color='blue'><b>Broadbent</b></font>) knife and fork when this work of devotion is over.
And now the sweets and puddings are come, of which I can give you a
list, if you like; but what young lady cares for the puddings of to-day,
much more for those which were eaten a hundred years ago, and which
Madam Esmond had prepared for her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) guests with so much neatness and
skill? Then, the table being cleared, Nathan, her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) chief manager, lays a
glass to every person, and fills his (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) mistress's. Bowing to the company,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) says she (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) drinks but one toast, but knows how heartily all the
gentlemen present will join her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>). Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) calls, <div class="bookquote">``His (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) Majesty,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>bowing
to Mr. Braddock, who with his (<font color='blue'><b>Braddock</b></font>) aides-de-camp and the colonial gentlemen
all loyally repeat the name of their beloved and gracious Sovereign. And
hereupon, having drunk her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) glass of wine and saluted all the company,
the widow retires between a row of negro servants, performing one of her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>)
very handsomest curtsies at the door.

<p/>The kind Mistress of Castlewood bore her (<font color='blue'><b>Mistress</b></font>) part in the entertainment with
admirable spirit, and looked so gay and handsome, and spoke with such
cheerfulness and courage to all her (<font color='blue'><b>Mistress</b></font>) company, that the few ladies who
were present at the dinner could not but congratulate Madam Esmond upon
the elegance of the feast, and especially upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) manner of presiding
at it. But they were scarcely got to her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) drawing-room when her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>)
artificial courage failed her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) burst into tears on the sofa by
Mrs. Laws' side, just in the midst of a compliment from that lady. <div class="bookquote">``Ah,
madam!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``it may be an honour, as you say, to have the
King's representative in my house, and our family has received greater
personages than Mr. Braddock. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Braddock</b></font>) comes to take one of my sons away
from me. Who knows whether my boy will return, or how? I dreamed of him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
last night as wounded, and quite white, with blood streaming from his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
side. I would not be so ill-mannered as to let my grief be visible
before the gentlemen; but, my good Mrs. Justice, who has parted with
children, and who has a mother's heart of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) own, would like me none
the better, if mine were very easy this evening.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>The ladies administered such consolations as seemed proper or palatable
to their hostess, who tried not to give way further to her (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>) melancholy,
and remembered that she (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>) had other duties to perform, before yielding to
her (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>) own sad mood. <div class="bookquote">``It will be time enough, madam, to be sorry when they
are gone,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>) said to the Justice's wife, her (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>) good neighbour. <div class="bookquote">``My boy
must not see me following him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) with a wistful face, and have our parting
made more dismal by my weakness. It is good that gentlemen of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) rank
and station should show themselves where their country calls them.
That has always been the way of the Esmonds, and the same Power which
graciously preserved my dear father through twenty great battles in the
Queen's time, I trust and pray, will watch over my son now his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) turn
is come to do his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) duty.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>And, now, instead of lamenting her (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>) fate, or
further alluding to it, I dare say the resolute lady sate down with
her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) female friends to a pool of cards and a dish of coffee, whilst the
gentlemen remained in the neighbouring parlour, still calling their
toasts and drinking their wine. When one lady objected that these latter
were sitting rather long, Madam Esmond said: <div class="bookquote">``It would improve and amuse
the boys to be with the English gentlemen. Such society was very rarely
to be had in their distant province, and though their conversation
sometimes was free, she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) was sure that gentleman and men of fashion would
have regard to the youth of her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) sons, and say nothing before them which
young people should not hear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Madam Esmond/Madam Esmond Warrington/Madam Warrington</b></font>)</div><p/>It was evident that the English gentlemen relished the good cheer
provided for them. Whilst the ladies were yet at their cards, Nathan
came in and whispered Mrs. Mountain, who at first cried out--<div class="bookquote">``No! she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>)
would give no more--the common Bordeaux they might have, and welcome,
if they still wanted more--but she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) would not give any more of the
Colonel's.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Mountain/Mountain</b></font>)</div>It appeared that the dozen bottles of particular claret had
been already drunk up by the gentlemen, <div class="bookquote">``besides ale, cider, Burgundy,
Lisbon, and Madeira,''  (<font color='red'><b>the gentlemen</b></font>)</div>says Mrs. Mountain, enumerating the supplies.

<p/>But Madam Esmond was for having no stint in the hospitality of the
night. Mrs. Mountain was fain to bustle away with her (<font color='blue'><b>Mountain</b></font>) keys to the sacred
vault where the Colonel's particular Bordeaux lay, surviving its master,
who, too, had long passed underground. As they went on their journey,
Mrs. Mountain asked whether any of the gentlemen had had too much?
Nathan thought Mister Broadbent was tipsy--he (<font color='blue'><b>Broadbent</b></font>) always tipsy; be then
thought the General gentleman was tipsy; and he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) thought Master George
was a lilly drunk.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Master George!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Mountain/Mountain</b></font>)</div>cries Mrs. Mountain: <div class="bookquote">``why, he (<font color='blue'><b>Master</b></font>) will sit for days without
touching a drop.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Mountain/Mountain</b></font>)</div><p/>Nevertheless, Nathan persisted in his (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) notion that Master George was
a lilly drunk. He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) was always filling his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) glass, he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) had talked, he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) had
sung, he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) had cut jokes, especially against Mr. Washington, which made
Mr. Washington quite red and angry, Nathan said. <div class="bookquote">``Well, well!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Mountain/Mountain</b></font>)</div>Mrs.
Mountain cried eagerly; <div class="bookquote">``it was right a gentleman should make himself
merry in good company, and pass the bottle along with his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) friends.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Mountain/Mountain</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Mountain</b></font>) trotted to the particular Bordeaux cellar with only the more
alacrity.

<p/>The tone of freedom and almost impertinence which young George Esmond
had adopted of late days towards Mr. Washington had very deeply vexed
and annoyed that gentleman. There was scarce half a dozen years'
difference of age between him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) and the Castlewood twins;--but Mr.
Washington had always been remarked for a discretion and sobriety much
beyond his (<font color='blue'><b>Washington</b></font>) time of life, whilst the boys of Castlewood seemed younger
than theirs. They had always been till now under their mother's anxious
tutelage, and had looked up to their neighbour of Mount Vernon as their
guide, director, friend--as, indeed, almost everybody seemed to do who
came in contact with the simple and upright young man. Himself of the
most scrupulous gravity and good breeding, in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) communication with
other folks he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) appeared to exact, or, at any rate, to occasion, the same
behaviour. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) nature was above levity and jokes: they seemed out of
place when addressed to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was slow of comprehending them: and they
slunk as it were abashed out of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) society. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) always seemed great to
me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>says Harry Warrington, in one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) letters many years after the
date of which we are writing; <div class="bookquote">``and I never thought of him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) otherwise than
of a hero. When he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) came over to Castlewood and taught us boys surveying,
to see him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) riding to hounds was as if he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was charging an army. If he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
fired a shot, I thought the bird must come down, and if be flung a net,
the largest fish in the river were sure to be in it. His (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) words were
always few, but they were always wise; they were not idle, as our words
are, they were grave, sober, and strong, and ready on occasion to do
their duty. In spite of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) antipathy to him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>), my brother respected and
admired the General as much as I did--that is to say, more than any
mortal man.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Washington was the first to leave the jovial party which were doing
so much honour to Madam Esmond's hospitality. Young George Esmond, who
had taken his (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) mother's place when she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) left it, had been free with the
glass and with the tongue. He (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) had said a score of things to his (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) guest
which wounded and chafed the latter, and to which Mr. Washington could
give no reply. Angry beyond all endurance, he (<font color='blue'><b>Washington</b></font>) left the table at length,
and walked away through the open windows into the broad verandah or
porch which belonged to Castlewood as to all Virginian houses.

<p/>Here Madam Esmond caught sight of her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) friend's tall frame as it strode
up and down before the windows; and, the evening being warm, or her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) game
over, she (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) gave up her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) cards to one of the other ladies, and joined her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>)
good neighbour out of doors. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) tried to compose his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) countenance as well
as he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) could: it was impossible that he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) should explain to his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) hostess why
and with whom he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) was angry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The gentlemen are long over their wine,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``gentlemen of the
army are always fond of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If drinking makes good soldiers, some yonder are distinguishing
themselves greatly, madam,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Washington.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And I dare say the General is at the head of his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) troops?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No doubt, no doubt,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Colonel</b></font>)</div>answered the Colonel, who always received this
lady's remarks, playful or serious, with a peculiar softness and
kindness. <div class="bookquote">``But the General is the General, and it is not for me to make
remarks on his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) Excellency's doings at table or elsewhere. I think very
likely that military gentlemen born and bred at home are different from
us of the colonies. We have such a hot sun, that we need not wine to
fire our blood as they do. And drinking toasts seems a point of honour
with them. Talmadge hiccupped to me--I should say, whispered to me just
now, that an officer could no more refuse a toast than a challenge, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) said that it was after the greatest difficulty and dislike at first
that he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) learned to drink. He (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) has certainly overcome his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) difficulty with
uncommon resolution.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What, I wonder, can you talk of for so many hours?''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>asked the lady.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think I can tell you all we talk of, madam, and I must not
tell tales out of school. We talked about the war, and of the force Mr.
Contrecoeur has, and how we are to get at him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>). The General is for making
the campaign in his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) coach, and makes light of it and the enemy. That we
shall beat them, if we meet them, I trust there is no doubt.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How can there be?''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>says the lady, whose father had served under
Marlborough.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Franklin, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Franklin</b></font>) is only from New England,''  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>continued the
gentleman, <div class="bookquote">``spoke great good sense, and would have spoken more if the
English gentlemen would let him (<font color='blue'><b>Franklin</b></font>); but they reply invariably that we are
only raw provincials, and don't know what disciplined British troops can
do. Had they not best hasten forwards and make turnpike roads and
have comfortable inns ready for his (<font color='blue'><b>Franklin</b></font>) Excellency at the end of the day's
march?--`There's some sort of inns, I suppose,' says Mr. Danvers, `not
so comfortable as we have in England: we can't expect that.'--`No,
you can't expect that,' says Mr. Franklin, who seems a very shrewd
and facetious person. He (<font color='blue'><b>Franklin</b></font>) drinks his (<font color='blue'><b>Franklin</b></font>) water, and seems to laugh at the
Englishmen, though I doubt whether it is fair for a water-drinker to sit
by and spy out the weaknesses of gentlemen over their wine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And my boys? I hope they are prudent?''  (<font color='red'><b>the widow</b></font>)</div>said the widow, laying her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) hand
on her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) guest's arm. <div class="bookquote">``Harry promised me, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) gives his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) word, I
can trust him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) for anything. George is always moderate. Why do you look
so grave?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed, to be frank with you, I do not know what has come over George
in these last days,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Washington. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) has some grievance against
me which I do not understand, and of which I don't care to ask the
reason. He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) spoke to me before the gentlemen in a way which scarcely
became him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>). We are going the campaign together, and `tis a pity we begin
such ill friends.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) has been ill. He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) is always wild and wayward, and hard to understand.
But he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) has the most affectionate heart in the world. You will bear with
him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>), you will protect him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)--promise me you will.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear lady, I will do so with my life,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Washington/Washington</b></font>)</div>Mr. Washington said with great
fervour. <div class="bookquote">``You know I would lay it down cheerfully for you or any you
love.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And my father's blessing and mine go with you, dear friend!''  (<font color='red'><b>the widow</b></font>)</div>cried the
widow, full of thanks and affection.

<p/>As they pursued their conversation, they had quitted the porch under
which they had first began to talk, and where they could hear the
laughter and toasts of the gentlemen over their wine, and were pacing a
walk on the rough lawn before the house. Young George Warrington, from
his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) place at the head of the table in the dining-room, could see the
pair as they passed to and fro, and had listened for some time past,
and replied in a very distracted manner to the remarks of the gentlemen
round about him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>), who were too much engaged with their own talk and
jokes, and drinking, to pay much attention to their young host's
behaviour. Mr. Braddock loved a song after dinner, and Mr. Danvers, his (<font color='blue'><b>Danvers</b></font>)
aide-de-camp, who had a fine tenor voice, was delighting his (<font color='blue'><b>Danvers</b></font>) General
with the latest ditty from Marybone Gardens, when George Warrington,
jumping up, ran towards the window, and then returned and pulled his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>)
brother Harry by the sleeve, who sate with his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) back towards the window.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>says Harry, who, for his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) part, was charmed, too, with the
song and chorus.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>cried George, with a stamp of his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) foot, and the younger followed
obediently.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is it?''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>continued George, with a bitter oath. <div class="bookquote">``Don't you see what
it is? They were billing and cooing this morning; they are billing and
cooing now before going to roost. Had we not better both go into the
garden, and pay our duty to our mamma and papa?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) pointed to Mr.
Washington, who was taking the widow's hand very tenderly in his (<font color='blue'><b>Washington</b></font>).




<p/>CHAPTER X. A Hot Afternoon


<p/>General Braddock and the other guests of Castlewood being duly consigned
to their respective quarters, the boys retired to their own room, and
there poured out to one another their opinions respecting the great
event of the day. They would not bear such a marriage--no. Was the
representative of the Marquises of Esmond to marry the younger son of
a colonial family, who had been bred up as a land-surveyor? Castlewood,
and the boys at nineteen years of age, handed over to the tender mercies
of a stepfather of three-and-twenty! Oh, it was monstrous! Harry was for
going straightway to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) mother in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) bedroom--where her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) black maidens
were divesting her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) ladyship of the simple jewels and fineries which she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
had assumed in compliment to the feast--protesting against the odious
match, and announcing that they would go home, live upon their little
property there, and leave her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) for ever, if the unnatural union took
place.

<p/>George advocated another way of stopping it, and explained his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) plan to
his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) admiring brother. <div class="bookquote">``Our mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``can't marry a man with
whom one or both of us has been out on the field, and who has wounded us
or killed us, or whom we have wounded or killed. We must have him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) out,
Harry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry saw the profound truth conveyed in George's statement, and admired
his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) brother's immense sagacity. <div class="bookquote">``No, George,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>says he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``you are right.
Mother can't marry our murderer; she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) won't be as bad as that. And if we
pink him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) is done for. `Cadit quaestio,' as Mr. Dempster used to say.
Shall I send my boy with a challenge to Colonel George now?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear Harry,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>the elder replied, thinking with some complacency of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) affair of honour at Quebec, <div class="bookquote">``you are not accustomed to affairs of
this sort.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>owned Harry, with a sigh, looking with envy and admiration on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
senior.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We can't insult a gentleman in our own house,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>continued George, with
great majesty; <div class="bookquote">``the laws of honour forbid such inhospitable treatment.
But, sir, we can ride out with him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>), and, as soon as the park gates are
closed, we can tell him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) our mind.''

 (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That we can, by George!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>cries Harry, grasping his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) brother's hand, <div class="bookquote">``and
that we will, too. I say, Georgy...''  (<font color='red'><b>brother</b></font>)</div>Here the lad's face became very
red, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) brother asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) what he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) would say?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This is my turn, brother,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>Harry pleaded. <div class="bookquote">``If you go the campaign, I
ought to have the other affair. Indeed, indeed, I ought.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) prayed
for this bit of promotion.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Again the head of the house must take the lead, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>George said,
with a superb air. <div class="bookquote">``If I fall, my Harry will avenge me. But I must fight
George Washington, Hal: and `tis best I should; for, indeed, I hate him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
the worst. Was it not he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) who counselled my mother to order that wretch,
Ward, to lay hands on me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, George,''  (<font color='red'><b>the brother</b></font>)</div>interposed the more pacable younger brother, <div class="bookquote">``you ought to
forget and forgive.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the brother</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Forgive? Never, sir, as long as I remember. You can't order remembrance
out of a man's mind; and a wrong that was a wrong yesterday must be a
wrong to-morrow. I never, of my knowledge, did one to any man, and I
never will suffer one, if I can help it. I think very ill of Mr. Ward,
but I don't think so badly of him (<font color='blue'><b>Ward</b></font>) as to suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>Ward</b></font>) will ever forgive
thee that blow with the ruler. Colonel Washington is our enemy, mine
especially. He (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) has advised one wrong against me, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) meditates a
greater. I tell you, brother, we must punish him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div><p/>The grandsire's old Bordeaux had set George's ordinarily pale
countenance into a flame. Harry, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) brother's fondest worshipper,
could not but admire George's haughty bearing and rapid declamation, and
prepared himself, with his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) usual docility, to follow his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) chief. So the
boys went to their beds, the elder conveying special injunctions to his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
junior to be civil to all the guests so long as they remained under the
maternal roof on the morrow.

<p/>Good manners and a repugnance to telling tales out of school, forbid us
from saying which of Madam Esmond's guests was the first to fall under
the weight of her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) hospitality. The respectable descendants of Messrs.
Talmadge and Danvers, aides-de-camp to his (<font color='blue'><b>Talmadge</b></font>) Excellency, might not care to
hear how their ancestors were intoxicated a hundred years ago; and yet
the gentlemen themselves took no shame in the fact, and there is little
doubt they or their comrades were tipsy twice or thrice in the week.
Let us fancy them reeling to bed, supported by sympathising negroes; and
their vinous General, too stout a toper to have surrendered himself to
a half-dozen bottles of Bordeaux, conducted to his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) chamber by the young
gentlemen of the house, and speedily sleeping the sleep which friendly
Bacchus gives. The good lady of Castlewood saw the condition of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
guests without the least surprise or horror; and was up early in the
morning, providing cooling drinks for their hot palates, which the
servants carried to their respective chambers. At breakfast, one of
the English officers rallied Mr. Franklin, who took no wine at all, and
therefore refused the morning cool draught of toddy, by showing how the
Philadelphia gentleman lost two pleasures, the drink and the toddy. The
young fellow said the disease was pleasant and the remedy delicious, and
laughingly proposed to continue repeating them both. The General's new
American aide-de-camp, Colonel Washington, was quite sober and serene.
The British officers vowed they must take him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) in hand, and teach him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>)
what the ways of the English army were; but the Virginian gentleman
gravely said he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) did not care to learn that part of the English military
education.

<p/>The widow, occupied as she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) had been with the cares of a great dinner,
followed by a great breakfast on the morning ensuing, had scarce leisure
to remark the behaviour of her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) sons very closely, but at least saw that
George was scrupulously polite to her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) favourite, Colonel Washington, as
to all the other guests of the house.

<p/>Before Mr. Braddock took his (<font color='blue'><b>Braddock</b></font>) leave, he (<font color='blue'><b>Braddock</b></font>) had a private audience of Madam
Esmond, in which his (<font color='blue'><b>Braddock</b></font>) Excellency formally offered to take her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) son into
his (<font color='blue'><b>Braddock</b></font>) family; and when the arrangements for George's departure were
settled between his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) mother and future chief, Madam Esmond, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>)
might feel them, did not show any squeamish terrors about the dangers
of the bottle, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) saw were amongst the severest and most certain
which her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) son would have to face. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) knew her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) boy must take his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) part in
the world, and encounter his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) portion of evil and good. <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Braddock
is a perfect fine gentleman in the morning,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) said stoutly to her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>)
aide-de-camp, Mrs. Mountain; <div class="bookquote">``and though my papa did not drink, `tis
certain that many of the best company in England do.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Mountain/Mountain</b></font>)</div>The jolly General
good-naturedly shook hands with George, who presented himself to his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>)
Excellency after the maternal interview was over, and bade George
welcome, and to be in attendance at Frederick three days hence; shortly
after which time the expedition would set forth.

<p/>And now the great coach was again called into requisition, the General's
escort pranced round it, the other guests and their servants went to
horse. The lady of Castlewood attended his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) Excellency to the steps of
the verandah in front of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) house, the young gentlemen followed, and
stood on each side of his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) coach-door. The guard trumpeter blew a shrill
blast, the negroes shouted <div class="bookquote">``Huzzay, and God sabe de King,''  (<font color='red'><b>the negroes</b></font>)</div>as Mr.
Braddock most graciously took leave of his (<font color='blue'><b>Braddock</b></font>) hospitable entertainers, and
rolled away on his (<font color='blue'><b>Braddock</b></font>) road to headquarters.

<p/>As the boys went up the steps, there was the Colonel once more taking
leave of their mother. No doubt she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had been once more recommending
George to his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) namesake's care; for Colonel Washington said: <div class="bookquote">``With my
life. You may depend on me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Washington/Washington</b></font>)</div>as the lads returned to their mother and
the few guests still remaining in the porch. The Colonel was booted and
ready to depart. <div class="bookquote">``Farewell, my dear Harry,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``With you, George,
`tis no adieu. We shall meet in three days at the camp.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the men</b></font>)</div><p/>Both the young men were going to danger, perhaps to death. Colonel
Washington was taking leave of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) no more
before the campaign. No wonder the widow was very much moved.

<p/>George Warrington watched his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) mother's emotion, and interpreted it with
a pang of malignant scorn. <div class="bookquote">``Stay yet a moment, and console our mamma,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) said with a steady countenance, <div class="bookquote">``only the time to get ourselves
booted, and my brother and I will ride with you a little way, George.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>George Warrington had already ordered his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) horses. The three young
men were speedily under way, their negro grooms behind them, and Mrs.
Mountain, who knew she (<font color='blue'><b>Mountain</b></font>) had made mischief between them and trembled for
the result, felt a vast relief that Mr. Washington was gone without a
quarrel with the brothers, without, at any rate, an open declaration of
love to their mother.

<p/>No man could be more courteous in demeanour than George Warrington to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) neighbour and namesake, the Colonel. The latter was pleased and
surprised at his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) young friend's altered behaviour. The community of
danger, the necessity of future fellowship, the softening influence of
the long friendship which bound him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) to the Esmond family, the tender
adieux which had just passed between him (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) and the mistress of Castlewood,
inclined the Colonel to forget the unpleasantness of the past days, and
made him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) more than usually friendly with his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) young companion. George
was quite gay and easy: it was Harry who was melancholy now: he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) rode
silently and wistfully by his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) brother, keeping away from Colonel
Washington, to whose side he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) used always to press eagerly before. If
the honest Colonel remarked his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) young friend's conduct, no doubt he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>)
attributed it to Harry's known affection for his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) brother, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>)
natural anxiety to be with George now the day of their parting was so
near.

<p/>They talked further about the war, and the probable end of the campaign:
none of the three doubted its successful termination. Two thousand
veteran British troops with their commander must get the better of any
force the French could bring against them, if only they moved in decent
time. The ardent young Virginian soldier had an immense respect for the
experienced valour and tactics of the regular troops. King George II.
had no more loyal subject than Mr. Braddock's new aide-de-camp.

<p/>So the party rode amicably together, until they reached a certain rude
log-house, called Benson's, of which the proprietor, according to the
custom of the day and country, did not disdain to accept money from
his (<font color='blue'><b>proprietor</b></font>) guests in return for hospitalities provided. There was a recruiting
station here, and some officers and men of Halkett's regiment assembled,
and here Colonel Washington supposed that his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) young friends would take
leave of him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>).

<p/>Whilst their horses were baited, they entered the public room, and
found a rough meal prepared for such as were disposed to partake. George
Warrington entered the place with a particularly gay and lively air,
whereas poor Harry's face was quite white and woebegone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``One would think, Squire Harry, `twas you who was going to leave home
and fight the French and Indians, and not Mr. George,''  (<font color='red'><b>Molly/Benson/Miss Molly Benson</b></font>)</div>says Benson.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I may be alarmed about danger to my brother,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>said Harry, <div class="bookquote">``though I
might bear my own share pretty well. `Tis not my fault that I stay at
home.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, indeed, brother,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>cries George.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Harry Warrington's courage does not need any proof!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Washington/Washington</b></font>)</div>cries Mr.
Washington.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You do the family honour by speaking so well of us, Colonel,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>says Mr.
George, with a low bow. <div class="bookquote">``I dare say we can hold our own, if need be.''

 (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div><p/>Whilst his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) friend was vaunting his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) courage, Harry looked, to say the
truth, by no means courageous. As his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) eyes met his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) brother's, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) read in
George's look an announcement which alarmed the fond faithful lad. <div class="bookquote">``You
are not going to do it now?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) whispered his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) brother.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, now,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>says Mr. George, very steadily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``For God's sake, let me have the turn. You are going on the campaign,
you ought not to have everything--and there may be an explanation,
George. We may be all wrong.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Psha, how can we? It must be done now--don't be alarmed. No names shall
be mentioned--I shall easily find a subject.''

 (<font color='red'><b>A couple</b></font>)</div><p/>A couple of Halkett's officers, whom our young gentlemen knew, were
sitting under the porch, with the Virginian toddy-bowl before them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What are you conspiring, gentlemen?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>cried one of them. <div class="bookquote">``Is it a
drink?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the gentlemen</b></font>)</div><p/>By the tone of their voices and their flushed cheeks, it was clear the
gentlemen had already been engaged in drinking that morning.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The very thing, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>George said gaily. <div class="bookquote">``Fresh glasses, Mr. Benson!
What, no glasses? Then we must have at the bowl.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Many a good man has drunk from it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Benson</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Benson; and the lads one
after another, and bowing first to their military acquaintance, touched
the bowl with their lips. The liquor did not seem to be much diminished
for the boys' drinking, though George especially gave himself a toper's
airs, and protested it was delicious after their ride. He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) called out
to Colonel Washington, who was at the porch, to join his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) friends, and
drink.

<p/>The lad's tone was offensive, and resembled the manner lately adopted by
him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>), and which had so much chafed Mr. Washington. He (<font color='blue'><b>Washington</b></font>) bowed, and said he (<font color='blue'><b>Washington</b></font>)
was not thirsty.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, the liquor is paid for,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>says George; <div class="bookquote">``never fear, Colonel.''

 (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I said I was not thirsty. I did not say the liquor was not paid for,''
 (<font color='red'><b>the Colonel</b></font>)</div>said the young Colonel, drumming with his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) foot.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``When the King's health is proposed, an officer can hardly say no. I
drink the health of his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) Majesty, gentlemen,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>cried George. <div class="bookquote">``Colonel
Washington can drink it or leave it. The King!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>This was a point of military honour. The two British officers of
Halkett's, Captain Grace and Mr. Waring, both drank <div class="bookquote">``The King.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Waring</b></font>)</div>Harry
Warrington drank <div class="bookquote">``The King.''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>Colonel Washington, with glaring eyes,
gulped, too, a slight draught from the bowl.

<p/>Then Captain Grace proposed <div class="bookquote">``The Duke and the Army,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grace</b></font>)</div>which toast there
was likewise no gainsaying. Colonel Washington had to swallow <div class="bookquote">``The Duke
and the Army.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Colonel</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't seem to stomach the toast, Colonel,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>said George.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I tell you again, I don't want to drink,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Colonel</b></font>)</div>replied the Colonel. <div class="bookquote">``It
seems to me the Duke and the Army would be served all the better if
their healths were not drunk so often.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are not up to the ways of regular troops as yet,''  (<font color='red'><b>Captain</b></font>)</div>said Captain
Grace, with rather a thick voice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``May be not, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A British officer,''  (<font color='red'><b>Captain</b></font>)</div>continues Captain Grace, with great energy but
doubtful articulation, <div class="bookquote">``never neglects a toast of that sort, nor any
other duty. A man who refuses to drink the health of the Duke--hang me,
such a man should be tried by a court-martial!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Grace</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What means this language to me? You are drunk, sir!''  (<font color='red'><b>Colonel</b></font>)</div>roared Colonel
Washington, jumping up, and striking the table with his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) fist.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A cursed provincial officer say I'm drunk!''  (<font color='red'><b>Captain</b></font>)</div>shrieks out Captain Grace.
<div class="bookquote">``Waring, do you hear that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I heard it, sir!''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>cried George Warrington. <div class="bookquote">``We all heard it. He (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>)
entered at my invitation--the liquor called for was mine: the table was
mine--and I am shocked to hear such monstrous language used at it as
Colonel Washington has just employed towards my esteemed guest, Captain
Waring.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Confound your impudence, you infernal young jackanapes!''  (<font color='red'><b>Colonel</b></font>)</div>bellowed out
Colonel Washington. <div class="bookquote">``You dare to insult me before British officers, and
find fault with my language? For months past, I have borne with such
impudence from you, that if I had not loved your mother--yes, sir, and
your good grandfather and your brother--I would--I would--''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Here his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>)
words failed him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>), and the irate Colonel, with glaring eyes and purple
face, and every limb quivering with wrath, stood for a moment speechless
before his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) young enemy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You would what, sir?''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>says George, very quietly, <div class="bookquote">``if you did not
love my grandfather, and my brother, and my mother. You are making her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
petticoat a plea for some conduct of yours--you would do what, sir, may
I ask again?''

 (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I would put you across my knee and whip you, you snarling little puppy,
that's what I would do!''  (<font color='red'><b>the Colonel</b></font>)</div>cried the Colonel, who had found breath by this
time, and vented another explosion of fury.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Because you have known us all our lives, and made our house your own,
that is no reason you should insult either of us!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>here cried Harry,
starting up. <div class="bookquote">``What you have said, George Washington, is an insult to me
and my brother alike. You will ask pardon, sir!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pardon?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Or give us the reparation that is due to gentlemen,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>continues Harry.

<p/>The stout Colonel's heart smote him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) to think that he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) should be at mortal
quarrel or called upon to shed the blood of one of the lads he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) loved.
As Harry stood facing him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), with his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) fair hair, flushing cheeks, and
quivering voice, an immense tenderness and kindness filled the bosom of
the elder man. <div class="bookquote">``I--I am bewildered,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``My words, perhaps, were
very hasty. What has been the meaning of George's behaviour to me for
months back? Only tell me, and, perhaps--''

 (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div><p/>The evil spirit was awake and victorious in young George Warrington:
his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) black eyes shot out scorn and hatred at the simple and guileless
gentleman before him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``You are shirking from the question, sir, as you
did from the toast just now,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I am not a boy to suffer under
your arrogance. You have publicly insulted me in a public place, and I
demand a reparation.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In Heaven's name, be it!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Washington/Washington</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Washington, with the deepest grief
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Washington</b></font>) face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And you have insulted me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Captain</b></font>)</div>continues Captain Grace, reeling towards
him (<font color='blue'><b>Washington</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``What was it he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) said? Confound the militia captain--colonel, what
is he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)? You've insulted me! Oh, Waring! to think I should be insulted by
a captain of militia!''  (<font color='red'><b>the Captain</b></font>)</div>And tears bedewed the noble Captain's cheek as
this harrowing thought crossed his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) mind.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I insult you, you hog!''  (<font color='red'><b>the Colonel</b></font>)</div>the Colonel again yelled out, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) was little
affected by humour, and had no disposition to laugh as the others had at
the scene. And, behold, at this minute a fourth adversary was upon him (<font color='blue'><b>adversary</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Great Powers, sir!''  (<font color='red'><b>Captain</b></font>)</div>said Captain Waring, <div class="bookquote">``are three affairs not enough
for you, and must I come into the quarrel, too? You have a quarrel with
these two young gentlemen.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Waring</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hasty words, sir!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>cries poor Harry once more.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hasty words, sir!''  (<font color='red'><b>Captain</b></font>)</div>cries Captain Waring. <div class="bookquote">``A gentleman tells another
gentleman that he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) will put him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) across his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) knees and whip him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>), and you
call those hasty words? Let me tell you if any man were to say to me,
`Charles Waring,' or `Captain Waring, I'll put you across my knees and
whip you,' I'd say, `I'll drive my cheese-toaster through his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) body,'
if he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) were as big as Goliath, I would. That's one affair with young Mr.
George Warrington. Mr. Harry, of course, as a young man of spirit, will
stand by his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) brother. That's two. Between Grace and the Colonel apology
is impossible. And, now--run me through the body!--you call an officer
of my regiment--of Halkett's, sir!--a hog before my face! Great heavens,
sir! Mr. Washington, are you all like this in Virginia? Excuse me, I
would use no offensive personality, as, by George! I will suffer none
from any man! but, by Gad, Colonel! give me leave to tell you that you
are the most quarrelsome man I ever saw in my life. Call a disabled
officer of my regiment--for he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) is disabled, ain't you, Grace?--call him (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>)
a hog before me! You withdraw it, sir--you withdraw it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is this some infernal conspiracy in which you are all leagued against
me?''  (<font color='red'><b>the Colonel</b></font>)</div>shouted the Colonel. <div class="bookquote">``It would seem as if I was drunk, and not you,
as you all are. I withdraw nothing. I apologise for nothing. By heavens!
I will meet one or half a dozen of you in your turn, young or old, drunk
or sober.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not wish to hear myself called more names,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>cried Mr. George
Warrington. <div class="bookquote">``This affair can proceed, sir, without any further insult on
your part. When will it please you to give me the meeting?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The sooner the better, sir!''  (<font color='red'><b>the Colonel</b></font>)</div>said the Colonel, fuming with rage.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The sooner the better,''  (<font color='red'><b>Captain</b></font>)</div>hiccupped Captain Grace, with many oaths
needless to print---LRB-in those days, oaths were the customary garnish of
all gentlemen's conversation-RRB---and he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) rose staggering from his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) seat, and
reeled towards his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) sword, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) had laid by the door, and fell as he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>)
reached the weapon. <div class="bookquote">``The sooner the better!''  (<font color='red'><b>the wretch</b></font>)</div>the poor tipsy wretch again
cried out from the ground, waving his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) weapon and knocking his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) own hat
over his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``At any rate, this gentleman's business will keep cool till to-morrow,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Colonel</b></font>)</div>the militia Colonel said, turning to the other king's officer. <div class="bookquote">``You will
hardly bring your man out to-day, Captain Waring?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I confess that neither his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) hand nor mine are particularly steady,''  (<font color='red'><b>Waring</b></font>)</div>said
Waring.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mine is!''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>cried Mr. Warrington, glaring at his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) enemy.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) comrade of former days was as hot and as savage. <div class="bookquote">``Be it so--with
what weapon, sir?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Washington said sternly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not with small-swords, Colonel. We can beat you with them. You know
that from our old bouts. Pistols had better be the word.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``As you please, George Warrington--and God forgive you, George! God
pardon you, Harry! for bringing me into this quarrel,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Colonel</b></font>)</div>said the Colonel,
with a face full of sadness and gloom.

<p/>Harry hung his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) head, but George continued with perfect calmness: <div class="bookquote">``I,
sir? It was not I who called names, who talked of a cane, who insulted a
gentleman in a public place before gentlemen of the army. It is not the
first time you have chosen to take me for a negro, and talked of the
whip for me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div><p/>The Colonel started back, turning very red, and as if struck by a sudden
remembrance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Great heavens, George! is it that boyish quarrel you are still
recalling?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who made you the overseer of Castlewood?''  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div>said the boy, grinding his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
teeth. <div class="bookquote">``I am not your slave, George Washington, and I never will be. I
hated you then, and I hate you now. And you have insulted me, and I am a
gentleman, and so are you. Is that not enough?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Too much, only too much,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Colonel</b></font>)</div>said the Colonel, with a genuine grief on
his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) face, and at his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) heart. <div class="bookquote">``Do you bear malice too, Harry? I had not
thought this of thee!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I stand by my brother,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>said Harry, turning away from the Colonel's
look, and grasping George's hand. The sadness on their adversary's face
did not depart. <div class="bookquote">``Heaven be good to us! `Tis all clear now,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) muttered
to himself. <div class="bookquote">``The time to write a few letters, and I am at your service,
Mr. Warrington,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You have your own pistols at your saddle. I did not ride out with
any; but will send Sady back for mine. That will give you time enough,
Colonel Washington?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Plenty of time, sir.''  (<font color='red'><b>each gentleman</b></font>)</div>And each gentleman made the other a low bow,
and, putting his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) arm in his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) brother's, George walked away. The Virginian
officer looked towards the two unlucky captains, who were by this time
helpless with liquor. Captain Benson, the master of the tavern, was
propping the hat of one of them over his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) head.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is not altogether their fault, Colonel,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said my landlord, with a
grim look of humour. <div class="bookquote">``Jack Firebrace and Tom Humbold of Spotsylvania was
here this morning, chanting horses with `em. And Jack and Tom got `em to
play cards; and they didn't win--the British Captains didn't. And Jack
and Tom challenged them to drink for the honour of Old England, and
they didn't win at that game, neither, much. They are kind, free-handed
fellows when they are sober, but they are a pretty pair of fools--they
are.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Captain Benson, you are an old frontier man, and an officer of ours,
before you turned farmer and taverner. You will help me in this matter
with yonder young gentlemen?''  (<font color='red'><b>the Colonel</b></font>)</div>said the Colonel.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll stand by and see fair play, Colonel. I won't have no hand in it,
beyond seeing fair play. Madam Esmond has helped me many a time, tended
my poor wife in her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) lying-in, and doctored our Betty in the fever. You
ain't a-going to be very hard with them poor boys? Though I seen `em
both shoot: the fair one hunts well, as you know, but the old one's a
wonder at an ace of spades.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Will you be pleased to send my man with my valise, Captain, into any
private room which you can spare me? I must write a few letters before
this business comes on. God grant it were well over!''  (<font color='red'><b>the Captain</b></font>)</div>And the Captain
led the Colonel into almost the only other room of his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) house, calling,
with many oaths, to a pack of negro servants, to disperse thence, who
were chattering loudly among one another, and no doubt discussing the
quarrel which had just taken place. Edwin, the Colonel's man, returned
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) master's portmanteau, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) looked from the window, he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>)
saw Sady, George Warrington's negro, galloping away upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) errand,
doubtless, and in the direction of Castlewood. The Colonel, young and
naturally hot-headed, but the most courteous and scrupulous of men, and
ever keeping his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) strong passions under guard, could not but think with
amazement of the position in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) found, himself, and of the three,
perhaps four enemies, who appeared suddenly before him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>), menacing his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>)
life. How had this strange series of quarrels been brought about? He (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>)
had ridden away a few hours since from Castlewood, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) young
companions, and, to all seeming, they were perfect friends. A shower of
rain sends them into a tavern, where there are a couple of recruiting
officers, and they are not seated for half an hour at a social table,
but he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) has quarrelled with the whole company, called this one names,
agreed to meet another in combat, and threatened chastisement to a
third, the son of his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) most intimate friend!




<p/>CHAPTER XI. Wherein the two Georges prepare for Blood


<p/>The Virginian Colonel remained in one chamber of the tavern, occupied
with gloomy preparations for the ensuing meeting; his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) adversary in the
other room thought fit to make his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) testamentary dispositions, too, and
dictated, by his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) obedient brother and secretary, a grandiloquent letter
to his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) mother, of whom, and by that writing, he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) took a solemn farewell.
She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) would hardly, he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) supposed, pursue the scheme which she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had in view
-LRB-a peculiar satirical emphasis was laid upon the scheme which she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had
in view-RRB-, after the event of that morning, should he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) fall, as, probably,
would be the case.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear, dear George, don't say that!''  (<font color='red'><b>the secretary</b></font>)</div>cried the affrighted secretary.

<p/>```As probably will be the case,''' George persisted with great majesty.
``You know what a good shot Colonel George is, Harry. I, myself, am
pretty fair at a mark, and `tis probable that one or both of us will
drop.--`I scarcely suppose you will carry out the intentions you have
at present in view.''' This was uttered in a tone of still greater
bitterness than George had used even in the previous phrase. Harry wept
as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) took it down.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You see I say nothing; Madame Esmond's name does not even appear in the
quarrel. Do you not remember in our grandfather's life of himself, how
he (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) says that Lord Castlewood fought Lord Mohun on a pretext of a quarrel
at cards? and never so much as hinted at the lady's name, who was the
real cause of the duel? I took my hint, I confess, from that, Harry.
Our mother is not compromised in the--Why, child, what have you been
writing, and who taught thee to spell?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>Harry had written the last
words <div class="bookquote">``in view,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>in vew, and a great blot of salt water from his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) honest,
boyish eyes may have obliterated some other bad spelling.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't think about the spelling now, Georgy,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>whimpered George's
clerk. <div class="bookquote">``I'm too miserable for that. I begin to think, perhaps it's all
nonsense, perhaps Colonel George never--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never meant to take possession of Castlewood; never gave himself airs,
and patronised us there; never advised my mother to have me flogged,
never intended to marry her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>); never insulted me, and was insulted before
the king's officers; never wrote to his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) brother to say we should be the
better for his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) parental authority? The paper is there,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>cried the young
man, slapping his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) breast-pocket, <div class="bookquote">``and if anything happens to me, Harry
Warrington, you will find it on my corse!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Write yourself, Georgy, I can't write,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>says Harry, digging his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) fists
into his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) eyes, and smearing over the whole composition, bad spelling and
all, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) elbows.

<p/>On this, George, taking another sheet of paper, sate down at his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
brother's place, and produced a composition in which he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) introduced the
longest words, the grandest Latin quotations, and the most profound
satire of which the youthful scribe was master. He (<font color='blue'><b>scribe</b></font>) desired that his (<font color='blue'><b>scribe</b></font>)
negro boy, Sady, should be set free; that his (<font color='blue'><b>scribe</b></font>) Horace, a choice of his (<font color='blue'><b>scribe</b></font>)
books, and, if possible, a suitable provision should be made for his (<font color='blue'><b>scribe</b></font>)
affectionate tutor, Mr. Dempster; that his (<font color='blue'><b>scribe</b></font>) silver fruit-knife, his (<font color='blue'><b>scribe</b></font>)
music-books, and harpsichord, should be given to little Fanny Mountain;
and that his (<font color='blue'><b>scribe</b></font>) brother should take a lock of his (<font color='blue'><b>scribe</b></font>) hair, and wear it in
memory of his (<font color='blue'><b>scribe</b></font>) ever fond and faithfully attached George. And he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) sealed
the document with the seal of arms that his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) grandfather had worn.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The watch, of course, will be yours,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>said George, taking out his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
grandfather's gold watch, and looking at it. <div class="bookquote">``Why, two hours and a-half
are gone! `Tis time that Sady should be back with the pistols. Take the
watch, Harry dear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's no good!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>cried out Harry, flinging his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) arms round his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) brother.
<div class="bookquote">``If he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) fights you, I'll fight him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), too. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) kills my Georgy, -- him (<font color='blue'><b>Georgy</b></font>),
he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) shall have a shot at me!''  (<font color='red'><b>the lad</b></font>)</div>and the poor lad uttered more than one of
those expressions, which are said peculiarly to affect recording angels,
who have to take them down at celestial chanceries.

<p/>Meanwhile, General Braddock's new aide-de-camp had written five letters
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Braddock</b></font>) large resolute hand, and sealed them with his (<font color='blue'><b>Braddock</b></font>) seal. One was to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Braddock</b></font>) mother, at Mount Vernon; one to his (<font color='blue'><b>Braddock</b></font>) brother; one was addressed M. C.
only; and one to his (<font color='blue'><b>Braddock</b></font>) Excellency, Major-General Braddock. <div class="bookquote">``And one, young
gentleman, is for your mother, Madam Esmond,''  (<font color='red'><b>the boys</b></font>)</div>said the boys' informant.

<p/>Again the recording angel had to fly off with a violent expression,
which parted from the lips of George Warrington. The chancery previously
mentioned was crowded with such cases, and the messengers must have been
for ever on the wing. But I fear for young George and his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) oath there was
no excuse; for it was an execration uttered from a heart full of hatred,
and rage, and jealousy.

<p/>It was the landlord of the tavern who communicated these facts to the
young men. The Captain had put on his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) old militia uniform to do honour
to the occasion, and informed the boys that the Colonel was walking up
and down the garden a-waiting for `em, and that the Reg'lars was a'most
sober, too, by this time.

<p/>A plot of ground near the Captain's log-house had been enclosed with
shingles, and cleared for a kitchen-garden; there indeed paced Colonel
Washington, his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) hands behind his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) back, his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) head bowed down, a grave
sorrow on his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) handsome face. The negro servants were crowded at the
palings, and looking over. The officers under the porch had wakened
up also, as their host remarked. Captain Waring was walking, almost
steadily, under the balcony formed by the sloping porch and roof of the
wooden house; and Captain Grace was lolling over the railing, with eyes
which stared very much, though perhaps they did not see very clearly.
Benson's was a famous rendezvous for cock-fights, horse-matches, boxing,
and wrestling-matches, such as brought the Virginian country-folks
together. There had been many brawls at Benson's, and men who came
thither sound and sober, had gone thence with ribs broken and eyes
gouged out. And squires, and farmers, and negroes, all participated in
the sport.

<p/>There, then, stalked the tall young Colonel, plunged in dismal
meditation. There was no way out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) scrape, but the usual cruel one,
which the laws of honour and the practice of the country ordered. Goaded
into fury by the impertinence of a boy, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had used insulting words. The
young man had asked for reparation. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was shocked to think that George
Warrington's jealousy and revenge should have rankled in the young
fellow so long but the wrong had been the Colonel's, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) was bound to
pay the forfeit.

<p/>A great hallooing and shouting, such as negroes use, who love noise at
all times, and especially delight to yell and scream when galloping on
horseback, was now heard at a distance, and all the heads, woolly and
powdered, were turned in the direction of this outcry. It came from the
road over which our travellers had themselves passed three hours before,
and presently the clattering of a horse's hoofs was heard, and now Mr.
Sady made his (<font color='blue'><b>Sady</b></font>) appearance on his (<font color='blue'><b>Sady</b></font>) foaming horse, and actually fired a
pistol off in the midst of a prodigious uproar from his (<font color='blue'><b>Sady</b></font>) woolly brethren.
Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Sady</b></font>) fired another pistol off, to which noises Sady's horse, which
had carried Harry Warrington on many a hunt, was perfectly accustomed;
and now he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) was in the courtyard, surrounded by a score of his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) bawling
comrades, and was descending amidst fluttering fowls and turkeys,
kicking horses and shrieking frantic pigs; and brother-negroes crowded
round him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>), to whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) instantly began to talk and chatter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sady, sir, come here!''  (<font color='red'><b>Master</b></font>)</div>roars out Master Harry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sady, come here! Confound you!''  (<font color='red'><b>Master</b></font>)</div>shouts Master George. -LRB-Again the
recording angel is in requisition, and has to be off on one of his (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>)
endless errands to the register office.-RRB- <div class="bookquote">``Come directly, mas'r,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sady/Mr. Sady</b></font>)</div>says
Sady, and resumes his (<font color='blue'><b>Sady</b></font>) conversation with his (<font color='blue'><b>Sady</b></font>) woolly brethren. He (<font color='blue'><b>Sady</b></font>) grins.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Sady</b></font>) takes the pistols out of the holster. He (<font color='blue'><b>Sady</b></font>) snaps the locks. He (<font color='blue'><b>Sady</b></font>) points
them at a grunter, which plunges through the farmyard. He (<font color='blue'><b>Sady</b></font>) points down
the road, over which he (<font color='blue'><b>Sady</b></font>) has just galloped, and towards which the woolly
heads again turn. He (<font color='blue'><b>Sady</b></font>) says again, <div class="bookquote">``Comin', mas'r. Everybody a-comin'.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>And now, the gallop of other horses is heard. And who is yonder? Little
Mr. Dempster, spurring and digging into his (<font color='blue'><b>Dempster</b></font>) pony; and that lady in a
riding-habit on Madam Esmond's little horse, can it be Madam Esmond? No.
It is too stout. As I live it is Mrs. Mountain on Madam's grey!

<p/><div class="bookquote">``O Lor! O Golly! Hoop! Here dey come! Hurray!''  (<font color='red'><b>negroes</b></font>)</div>A chorus of negroes rises
up. <div class="bookquote">``Here dey are!''  (<font color='red'><b>Dr.</b></font>)</div>Dr. Dempster and Mrs. Mountain have clattered
into the yard, have jumped from their horses, have elbowed through the
negroes, have rushed into the house, have run through it and across the
porch, where the British officers are sitting in muzzy astonishment;
have run down the stairs to the garden where George and Harry are
walking, their tall enemy stalking opposite to them; and almost ere
George Warrington has had time sternly to say, <div class="bookquote">``What do you do here,
madam?''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Mountain has flung her (<font color='blue'><b>Mountain</b></font>) arms round his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) neck and cries:
<div class="bookquote">``Oh, George, my darling! It's a mistake! It's a mistake, and is all my
fault!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Mountain/Mountain</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What's a mistake?''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>asks George, majestically separating himself from
the embrace.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is it, Mounty?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>cries Harry, all of a tremble.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That paper I took out of his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) portfolio, that paper I picked up,
children; where the Colonel says he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) is going to marry a widow with two
children. Who should it be but you, children, and who should it be but
your mother?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, it's--it's not your mother. It's that little widow Custis whom
the Colonel is going to marry. He (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>)'d always take a rich one; I knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>)
would. It's not Mrs. Rachel Warrington. He (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) told Madam so to-day, just
before he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) was going away, and that the marriage was to come off after
the campaign. And--and your mother is furious, boys. And when Sady came
for the pistols, and told the whole house how you were going to fight,
I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Sady</b></font>) to fire the pistols off; and I galloped after him (<font color='blue'><b>Sady</b></font>), and I've
nearly broken my poor old bones in coming to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have a mind to break Mr. Sady's,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>growled George. <div class="bookquote">``I specially
enjoined the villain not to say a word.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank God he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) did, brother!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>said poor Harry. <div class="bookquote">``Thank God he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) did!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What will Mr. Washington and those gentlemen think of my servant
telling my mother at home that I was going to fight a duel?''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>asks Mr.
George, still in wrath.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You have shown your proofs before, George,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>says Harry, respectfully.
<div class="bookquote">``And, thank Heaven, you are not going to fight our old friend,--our
grandfather's old friend. For it was a mistake and there is no quarrel
now, dear, is there? You were unkind to him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) under a wrong impression.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I certainly acted under a wrong impression,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>owns George, <div class="bookquote">``but--''

 (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``George! George Washington!''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>Harry here cries out, springing over
the cabbage-garden towards the bowling-green, where the Colonel was
stalking, and though we cannot hear him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>), we see him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>), with both his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) hands
out, and with the eagerness of youth, and with a hundred blunders, and
with love and affection thrilling in his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) honest voice we imagine the lad
telling his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) tale to his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) friend.

<p/>There was a custom in those days which has disappeared from our manners
now, but which then lingered. When Harry had finished his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) artless story,
his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) friend the Colonel took him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) fairly to his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) arms, and held him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) heart: and his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) voice faltered as he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Thank God, thank God for
this!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, George,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>said Harry, who felt now how he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) loved his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) friend with all
his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) heart, <div class="bookquote">``how I wish I was going with you on the campaign!''  (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div>The other
pressed both the boy's hands, in a grasp of friendship, which each knew
never would slacken.

<p/>Then the Colonel advanced, gravely holding out his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) hand to Harry's elder
brother. Perhaps Harry wondered that the two did not embrace as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) and
the Colonel had just done. But, though hands were joined, the salutation
was only formal and stern on both sides.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I find I have done you a wrong, Colonel Washington,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>George said, <div class="bookquote">``and
must apologise, not for the error, but for much of my late behaviour
which has resulted from it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The error was mine! It was I who found that paper in your room, and
showed it to George, and was jealous of you, Colonel. All women are
jealous,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Mountain/Mountain</b></font>)</div>cried Mrs. Mountain.

<p/>```Tis a pity you could not have kept your eyes off my paper, madam,''
said Mr. Washington. <div class="bookquote">``You will permit me to say so. A great deal of
mischief has come because I chose to keep a secret which concerned only
myself and another person. For a long time George Warrington's heart has
been black with anger against me, and my feeling towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) has, I own,
scarce been more friendly. All this pain might have been spared to both
of us, had my private papers only been read by those for whom they were
written. I shall say no more now, lest my feelings again should betray
me into hasty words. Heaven bless thee, Harry! Farewell, George! And
take a true friend's advice, and try and be less ready to think evil of
your friends. We shall meet again at the camp, and will keep our weapons
for the enemy. Gentlemen! if you remember this scene to-morrow, you
will know where to find me.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>And with a very stately bow to the English
officers, the Colonel left the abashed company, and speedily rode away.




<p/>CHAPTER XII. News from the Camp


<p/>We must fancy that the parting between the brothers is over, that George
has taken his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) place in Mr. Braddock's family, and Harry has returned
home to Castlewood and his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) duty. His (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) heart is with the army, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
pursuits at home offer the boy no pleasure. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) does not care to own how
deep his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) disappointment is, at being obliged to stay under the homely,
quiet roof, now more melancholy than ever since George is away. Harry
passes his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) brother's empty chamber with an averted face; takes George's
place at the head of the table, and sighs as he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) drinks from his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) silver
tankard. Madam Warrington calls the toast of <div class="bookquote">``The King''  (<font color='red'><b>Madam Esmond/Madam Esmond Warrington/Madam Warrington</b></font>)</div>stoutly every
day; and, on Sundays, when Harry reads the service, and prays for all
travellers by land and by water, she (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) says, <div class="bookquote">``We beseech Thee to hear
us,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>with a peculiar solemnity. She (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) insists on talking about George
constantly, but quite cheerfully, and as if his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) return was certain. She (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>)
walks into his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) vacant room, with head upright, and no outward signs of
emotion. She (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) sees that his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) books, linen, papers, etc., are arranged
with care; talking of him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) with a very special respect, and specially
appealing to the old servants at meals, and so forth, regarding things
which are to be done <div class="bookquote">``when Mr. George comes home.''  (<font color='red'><b>the servants</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Mountain is
constantly on the whimper when George's name is mentioned, and Harry's
face wears a look of the most ghastly alarm; but his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) mother's is
invariably grave and sedate. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) makes more blunders at piquet and
backgammon than you would expect from her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>); and the servants find her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
awake and dressed, however early they may rise. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) has prayed Mr.
Dempster to come back into residence at Castlewood. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) is not severe or
haughty -LRB-as her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) wont certainly was-RRB- with any of the party, but quiet in
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) talk with them, and gentle in assertion and reply. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) is for ever
talking of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) father and his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) campaigns, who came out of them all with
no very severe wounds to hurt him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>); and so she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) hopes and trusts will her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
eldest son.

<p/>George writes frequent letters home to his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) brother, and, now the army
is on its march, compiles a rough journal, which he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) forwards as occasion
serves. This document is perused with great delight and eagerness by
the youth to whom it is addressed, and more than once read out in family
council, on the long summer nights, as Madam Esmond sits upright at her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>)
tea-table---LRB-she (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) never condescends to use the back of a chair-RRB---as
little Fanny Mountain is busy with her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) sewing, as Mr. Dempster and Mrs.
Mountain sit over their cards, as the hushed old servants of the house
move about silently in the gloaming, and listen to the words of the
young master. Hearken to Harry Warrington reading out his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) brother's
letter! As we look at the slim characters on the yellow page, fondly
kept and put aside, we can almost fancy him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) alive who wrote and who read
it--and yet, lo! they are as if they never had been; their portraits
faint images in frames of tarnished gold. Were they real once, or are
they mere phantasms? Did they live and die once? Did they love each
other as true brothers, and loyal gentlemen? Can we hear their voices
in the past? Sure I know Harry's, and yonder he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) sits in the warm summer
evening, and reads his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) young brother's simple story:

<p/>``It must be owned that the provinces are acting scurvily by his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) Majesty
King George II., and his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) representative here is in a flame of fury.
Virginia is bad enough, and poor Maryland not much better, but
Pennsylvania is worst of all. We pray them to send us troops from home
to fight the French; and we promise to maintain the troops when they
come. We not only don't keep our promise, and make scarce any provision
for our defenders, but our people insist upon the most exorbitant prices
for their cattle and stores, and actually cheat the soldiers who are
come to fight their battles. No wonder the General swears, and the
troops are sulky. The delays have been endless. Owing to the failure
of the several provinces to provide their promised stores and means of
locomotion, weeks and months have elapsed, during which time, no doubt,
the French have been strengthening themselves on our frontier and in the
forts they have turned us out of. Though there never will be any love
lost between me and Colonel Washington, it must be owned that your
favourite -LRB-I am not jealous, Hal-RRB- is a brave man and a good officer.
The family respect him (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) very much, and the General is always asking his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>)
opinion. Indeed, he (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) is almost the only man who has seen the Indians in
their war-paint, and I own I think he (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) was right in firing upon Mons.
Jumonville last year.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There is to be no more suite to that other quarrel at Benson's Tavern
than there was to the proposed battle between Colonel W. and a certain
young gentleman who shall be nameless. Captain Waring wished to pursue
it on coming into camp, and brought the message from Captain Grace,
which your friend, who is as bold as Hector, was for taking up, and
employed a brother aide-de-camp, Colonel Wingfield, on his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) side. But
when Wingfield heard the circumstances of the quarrel, how it had arisen
from Grace being drunk, and was fomented by Waring being tipsy, and how
the two 44th gentlemen had chosen to insult a militia officer, he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) swore
that Colonel Washington should not meet the 44th men; that he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) would
carry the matter straightway to his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) Excellency, who would bring the
two captains to a court-martial for brawling with the militia, and
drunkenness, and indecent behaviour, and the captains were fain to put
up their toasting-irons, and swallow their wrath. They were good-natured
enough out of their cups, and ate their humble-pie with very good
appetites at a reconciliation dinner which Colonel W. had with the 44th,
and where he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) was as perfectly stupid and correct as Prince Prettyman
need be. Hang him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>)! He (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) has no faults, and that's why I dislike him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>). When
he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) marries that widow--ah me! what a dreary life she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) will have of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wonder at the taste of some men, and the effrontery of some women,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Madam Esmond/Madam Esmond Warrington/Madam Warrington</b></font>)</div>says Madam Esmond, laying her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) teacup down. <div class="bookquote">``I wonder at any woman who
has been married once, so forgetting herself as to marry again! Don't
you, Mountain?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Monstrous!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Mountain/Mountain</b></font>)</div>says Mountain, with a queer look.

<p/>Dempster keeps his (<font color='blue'><b>Dempster</b></font>) eyes steadily fixed on his (<font color='blue'><b>Dempster</b></font>) glass of punch. Harry
looks as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was choking with laughter, or with some other concealed
emotion, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) mother says, <div class="bookquote">``Go on, Harry! Continue with your
brother's journal. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) writes well: but, ah, will he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) ever be able to
write like my papa?''

 (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry resumes: <div class="bookquote">``We keep the strictest order here in camp, and the orders
against drunkenness and ill-behaviour on the part of the men are very
severe. The roll of each company is called at morning, noon, and night,
and a return of the absent and disorderly is given in by the officer
to the commanding officer of the regiment, who has to see that they are
properly punished. The men are punished, and the drummers are always at
work. Oh, Harry, but it made one sick to see the first blood drawn from
a great strong white back, and to hear the piteous yell of the poor
fellow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, horrid!''  (<font color='red'><b>Madam Esmond/Madam Esmond Warrington/Madam Warrington</b></font>)</div>says Madam Esmond.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think I should have murdered Ward if he (<font color='blue'><b>Ward</b></font>) had flogged me. Thank Heaven
he (<font color='blue'><b>Ward</b></font>) got off with only a crack of the ruler! The men, I say, are looked
after carefully enough. I wish the officers were. The Indians have just
broken up their camp, and retired in dudgeon, because the young officers
were for ever drinking with the squaws--and--and--hum--ha.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Harry/Mr. Harry Warrington</b></font>)</div>Here Mr.
Harry pauses, as not caring to proceed with the narrative, in the
presence of little Fanny, very likely, who sits primly in her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) chair by
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) mother's side, working her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) little sampler.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Pass over that about the odious tipsy creatures,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>says Madam. And Harry
commences, in a loud tone, a much more satisfactory statement: <div class="bookquote">``Each
regiment has Divine Service performed at the head of its colours every
Sunday. The General does everything in the power of mortal man to
prevent plundering, and to encourage the people round about to bring in
provisions. He (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) has declared soldiers shall be shot who dare to interrupt
or molest the market-people. He (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) has ordered the price of provisions to
be raised a penny a pound, and has lent money out of his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) own pocket to
provide the camp. Altogether, he (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) is a strange compound, this General. He (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>)
flogs his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) men without mercy, but he (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) gives without stint. He (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) swears most
tremendous oaths in conversation, and tells stories which Mountain would
be shocked to hear--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why me?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>asks Mountain; <div class="bookquote">``and what have I to do with the General's silly
stories?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never mind the stories; and go on, Harry,''  (<font color='red'><b>the mistress</b></font>)</div>cries the mistress of the
house.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``--would be shocked to hear after dinner; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) never misses service.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) adores his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) Great Duke, and has his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) name constantly on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) lips. Our
two regiments both served in Scotland, where I dare say Mr. Dempster
knew the colour of their facings.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We saw the tails of their coats, as well as their facings,''  (<font color='red'><b>the tutor</b></font>)</div>growls the
little Jacobite tutor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Colonel Washington has had the fever very smartly, and has hardly been
well enough to keep up with the march. Had he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) not better go home and
be nursed by his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) widow? When either of us is ill, we are almost as good
friends again as ever. But I feel somehow as if I can't forgive him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) for
having wronged him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>). Good Powers! How I have been hating him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) for these
months past! Oh, Harry! I was in a fury at the tavern the other day,
because Mountain came up so soon, and put an end to our difference. We
ought to have burned a little gunpowder between us, and cleared the air.
But though I don't love him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), as you do, I know he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) is a good soldier, a
good officer, and a brave, honest man; and, at any rate, shall love him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
none the worse for not wanting to be our stepfather.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A stepfather, indeed!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>cries Harry's mother. <div class="bookquote">``Why, jealousy and
prejudice have perfectly maddened the poor child! Do you suppose the
Marquis of Esmond's daughter and heiress could not have found other
stepfathers for her (<font color='blue'><b>heiress</b></font>) sons than a mere provincial surveyor? If there are
any more such allusions in George's journal, I beg you skip `em, Harry,
my dear. About this piece of folly and blundering, there hath been quite
talk enough already.''

 (<font color='red'><b>redcoats</b></font>)</div><p/>```Tis a pretty sight,'' Harry continued, reading from his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) brother's
journal, ``to see a long line of redcoats, threading through the woods
or taking their ground after the march. The care against surprise is so
great and constant, that we defy prowling Indians to come unawares upon
us, and our advanced sentries and savages have on the contrary fallen in
with the enemy and taken a scalp or two from them. They are such cruel
villains, these French and their painted allies, that we do not think
of showing them mercy. Only think, we found but yesterday a little
boy scalped but yet alive in a lone house, where his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) parents had been
attacked and murdered by the savage enemy, of whom--so great is his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
indignation at their cruelty--our General has offered a reward of five
pounds for all the Indian scalps brought in.

<p/>``When our march is over, you should see our camp, and all the care
bestowed on it. Our baggage and our General's tents and guard are placed
quite in the centre of the camp. We have outlying sentries by twos, by
threes, by tens, by whole companies. At the least surprise, they are
instructed to run in on the main body and rally round the tents
and baggage, which are so arranged themselves as to be a strong
fortification. Sady and I, you must know, are marching on foot now, and
my horses are carrying baggage. The Pennsylvanians sent such rascally
animals into camp that they speedily gave in. What good horses were
left, `twas our duty to give up: and Roxana has a couple of packs upon
her (<font color='blue'><b>Roxana</b></font>) back instead of her (<font color='blue'><b>Roxana</b></font>) young master. She (<font color='blue'><b>Roxana</b></font>) knows me right well, and
whinnies when she (<font color='blue'><b>Roxana</b></font>) sees me, and I walk by her (<font color='blue'><b>Roxana</b></font>) side, and we have many a
talk together on the march.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``July 4. To guard against surprises, we are all warned to pay especial
attention to the beat of the drum; always halting when they hear the
long roll beat, and marching at the beat of the long march. We are
more on the alert regarding the enemy now. We have our advanced pickets
doubled, and two sentries at every post. The men on the advanced pickets
are constantly under arms, with fixed bayonets, all through the night,
and relieved every two hours. The half that are relieved lie down by
their arms, but are not suffered to leave their pickets. `Tis evident
that we are drawing very near to the enemy now. This packet goes out
with the General's to Colonel Dunbar's camp, who is thirty miles behind
us; and will be carried thence to Frederick, and thence to my honoured
mother's house at Castlewood, to whom I send my duty, with kindest
remembrances, as to all friends there, and bow much love I need not say
to my dearest brother from his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) affectionate--GEORGE E. WARRINGTON.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The whole land was now lying parched and scorching in the July heat. For
ten days no news had come from the column advancing on the Ohio. Their
march, though it toiled but slowly through the painful forest, must
bring them ere long up with the enemy; the troops, led by consummate
captains, were accustomed now to the wilderness, and not afraid of
surprise. Every precaution had been taken against ambush. It was the
outlying enemy who were discovered, pursued, destroyed, by the vigilant
scouts and skirmishers of the British force. The last news heard
was that the army had advanced considerably beyond the ground of Mr.
Washington's discomfiture on the previous year, and two days after must
be within a day's march of the French fort. About taking it no fears
were entertained; the amount of the French reinforcements from Montreal
was known. Mr. Braddock, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Braddock</b></font>) two veteran regiments from Britain,
and their allies of Virginia and Pennsylvania, were more than a match
for any troops that could be collected under the white flag.

<p/>Such continued to be the talk, in the sparse towns of our Virginian
province, at the gentry's houses, and the rough roadside taverns, where
people met and canvassed the war. The few messengers who were sent back
by the General reported well of the main force. `Twas thought the enemy
would not stand or defend himself at all. Had he (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) intended to attack, he (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>)
might have seized a dozen occasions for assaulting our troops at passes
through which they had been allowed to go entirely free. So George had
given up his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) favourite mare, like a hero as he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) was, and was marching
afoot with the line? Madam Esmond vowed that he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) should have the best
horse in Virginia or Carolina in place of Roxana. There were horses
enough to be had in the provinces, and for money. It was only for the
King's service that they were not forthcoming.

<p/>Although at their family meetings and repasts the inmates of Castlewood
always talked cheerfully, never anticipating any but a triumphant issue
to the campaign, or acknowledging any feeling of disquiet, yet, it must
be owned they were mighty uneasy when at home, quitting it ceaselessly,
and for ever on the trot from one neighbour's house to another in quest
of news. It was prodigious how quickly reports ran and spread. When,
for instance, a certain noted border warrior, called Colonel Jack, had
offered himself and his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) huntsmen to the General, who had declined the
ruffian's terms or his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) proffered service, the defection of Jack and his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>)
men was the talk of thousands of tongues immediately. The house negroes,
in their midnight gallops about the country, in search of junketing or
sweethearts, brought and spread news over amazingly wide districts. They
had a curious knowledge of the incidents of the march for a fortnight
at least after its commencement. They knew and laughed at the cheats
practised on the army, for horses, provisions, and the like; for a good
bargain over the foreigner was not an unfrequent or unpleasant practice
among New Yorkers, Pennsylvanians, or Marylanders; though `tis known
that American folks have become perfectly artless and simple in later
times, and never grasp, and never overreach, and are never selfish
now. For three weeks after the army's departure, the thousand reports
regarding it were cheerful; and when our Castlewood friends met at their
supper, their tone was confident and their news pleasant.

<p/>But on the 10th of July a vast and sudden gloom spread over the
province. A look of terror and doubt seemed to fall upon every face.
Affrighted negroes wistfully eyed their masters and retired, and hummed
and whispered with one another. The fiddles ceased in the quarters: the
song and laugh of those cheery black folk were hushed. Right and left,
everybody's servants were on the gallop for news. The country taverns
were thronged with horsemen, who drank and cursed and brawled at the
bars, each bringing his (<font color='blue'><b>horsemen</b></font>) gloomy story. The army had been surprised. The
troops had fallen into an ambuscade, and had been cut up almost to a
man. All the officers were taken down by the French marksmen and the
savages. The General had been wounded, and carried off the field in his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>)
sash. Four days afterwards the report was that the General was dead, and
scalped by a French Indian.

<p/>Ah, what a scream poor Mrs. Mountain gave, when Gumbo brought this
news from across the James River, and little Fanny sprang crying to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
mother's arms! <div class="bookquote">``Lord God Almighty, watch over us, and defend my boy!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Warrington/Mrs. Esmond/Mrs. Esmond Warrington</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Esmond, sinking down on her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) knees, and lifting her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) rigid hands
to Heaven. The gentlemen were not at home when this rumour arrived, but
they came in an hour or two afterwards, each from his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) hunt for news.
The Scots tutor did not dare to look up and meet the widow's agonising
looks. Harry Warrington was as pale as his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) mother. It might not be true
about the manner of the General's death--but he (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) was dead. The army had
been surprised by Indians, and had fled, and been killed without seeing
the enemy. An express had arrived from Dunbar's camp. Fugitives were
pouring in there. Should he (<font color='blue'><b>Dunbar</b></font>) go and see? He (<font color='blue'><b>Dunbar</b></font>) must go and see. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dunbar</b></font>) and stout
little Dempster armed themselves and mounted, taking a couple of mounted
servants with them.

<p/>They followed the northward track which the expeditionary army had hewed
out for itself, and at every step which brought them nearer to the scene
of action, the disaster of the fearful day seemed to magnify. The day
after the defeat a number of the miserable fugitives from the fatal
battle of the 9th July had reached Dunbar's camp, fifty miles from the
field. Thither poor Harry and his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) companions rode, stopping stragglers,
asking news, giving money, getting from one and all the same gloomy
tale--a thousand men were slain--two-thirds of the officers were
down--all the General's aides-de-camp were hit. Were hit?--but were they
killed? Those who fell never rose again. The tomahawk did its work upon
them. O brother, brother! All the fond memories of their youth, all the
dear remembrances of their childhood, the love and the laughter, the
tender romantic vows which they had pledged to each other as lads, were
recalled by Harry with pangs inexpressibly keen. Wounded men looked up
and were softened by his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) grief: rough women melted as they saw the woe
written on the handsome young face: the hardy old tutor could scarcely
look at him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) for tears, and grieved for him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) even more than for his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) dear
pupil who lay dead under the savage Indian knife.




<p/>CHAPTER XIII. Profitless Quest


<p/>At every step which Harry Warrington took towards Pennsylvania, the
reports of the British disaster were magnified and confirmed. Those two
famous regiments which had fought in the Scottish and Continental wars,
had fled from an enemy almost unseen, and their boasted discipline and
valour had not enabled them to face a band of savages and a few French
infantry. The unfortunate commander of the expedition had shown the
utmost bravery and resolution. Four times his (<font color='blue'><b>commander</b></font>) horse had been shot under
him (<font color='blue'><b>commander</b></font>). Twice he (<font color='blue'><b>commander</b></font>) had been wounded, and the last time of the mortal hurt
which ended his (<font color='blue'><b>commander</b></font>) life three days after the battle. More than one of
Harry's informants described the action to the poor lad,--the passage of
the river, the long line of advance through the wilderness, the firing
in front, the vain struggle of the men to advance, and the artillery
to clear the way of the enemy; then the ambushed fire from behind every
bush and tree, and the murderous fusillade, by which at least half of
the expeditionary force had been shot down. But not all the General's
suite were killed, Harry heard. One of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) aides-de-camp, a Virginian
gentleman, was ill of fever and exhaustion at Dunbar's camp.

<p/>One of them--but which? To the camp Harry hurried, and reached it at
length. It was George Washington Harry found stretched in a tent
there, and not his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) brother. A sharper pain than that of the fever Mr.
Washington declared he (<font color='blue'><b>Washington</b></font>) felt, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Washington</b></font>) saw Harry Warrington, and could
give him (<font color='blue'><b>Washington</b></font>) no news of George.

<p/>Mr. Washington did not dare to tell Harry all. For three days after
the fight his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) duty had been to be near the General. On the fatal 9th of
July, he (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) had seen George go to the front with orders from the chief,
to whose side he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) never returned. After Braddock himself died, the
aide-de-camp had found means to retrace his (<font color='blue'><b>Braddock</b></font>) course to the field. The
corpses which remained there were stripped and horribly mutilated.
One body he (<font color='blue'><b>Braddock</b></font>) buried which he (<font color='blue'><b>Braddock</b></font>) thought to be George Warrington's. His (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>)
own illness was increased, perhaps occasioned, by the anguish which he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>)
underwent in his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) search for the unhappy young volunteer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, George! If you had loved him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) you would have found him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) dead or
alive,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>Harry cried out. Nothing would satisfy him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) but that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), too,
should go to the ground and examine it. With money he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) procured a guide
or two. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) forded the river at the place where the army had passed
over: he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) went from one end to the other of the dreadful field. It was
no longer haunted by Indians now. The birds of prey were feeding on
the mangled festering carcases. Save in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) own grandfather, lying very
calm, with a sweet smile on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) lip, Harry had never yet seen the face
of Death. The horrible spectacle of mutilation caused him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) to turn away
with shudder and loathing. What news could the vacant woods, or those
festering corpses lying under the trees, give the lad of his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) lost
brother? He (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) was for going, unarmed and with a white flag, to the French
fort, whither, after their victory, the enemy had returned; but his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>)
guides refused to advance with him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>). The French might possibly respect
them, but the Indians would not. <div class="bookquote">``Keep your hair for your lady mother,
my young gentleman,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the guide. ```Tis enough that she (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) loses one son
in this campaign.''

<p/>When Harry returned to the English encampment at Dunbar's, it was his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
turn to be down with the fever. Delirium set in upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) lay
some time in the tent and on the bed from which his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) friend had just
risen convalescent. For some days he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) did not know who watched him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>); and
poor Dempster, who had tended him (<font color='blue'><b>Dempster</b></font>) in more than one of these maladies,
thought the widow must lose both her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) children; but the fever was so
far subdued that the boy was enabled to rally somewhat, and get to
horseback. Mr. Washington and Dempster both escorted him (<font color='blue'><b>Washington</b></font>) home. It was
with a heavy heart, no doubt, that all three beheld once more the gates
of Castlewood.

<p/>A servant in advance had been sent to announce their coming. First came
Mrs. Mountain and her (<font color='blue'><b>Mountain</b></font>) little daughter, welcoming Harry with many
tears and embraces, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Mountain</b></font>) scarce gave a nod of recognition to Mr.
Washington; and the little girl caused the young officer to start, and
turn deadly pale, by coming up to him (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) hands behind her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), and
asking, <div class="bookquote">``Why have you not brought George back too?''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>Harry did not hear.
The sobs and caresses of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) good friend and nurse luckily kept him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) from
listening to little Fanny.

<p/>Dempster was graciously received by the two ladies. <div class="bookquote">``Whatever could be
done, we know you would do, Mr. Dempster,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Mountain/Mountain</b></font>)</div>says Mrs. Mountain, giving
him (<font color='blue'><b>Dempster</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>Mountain</b></font>) hand. <div class="bookquote">``Make a curtsey to Mr. Dempster, Fanny, and remember,
child, to be grateful to all who have been friendly to our benefactors.
Will it please you to take any refreshment before you ride, Colonel
Washington?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Washington/Washington</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Washington had had a sufficient ride already, and counted as
certainly upon the hospitality of Castlewood, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Washington</b></font>) would upon the
shelter of his (<font color='blue'><b>Washington</b></font>) own house.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The time to feed my horse, and a glass of water for myself, and I will
trouble Castlewood hospitality no further,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Washington/Washington</b></font>)</div>Mr. Washington said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sure, George, you have your room here, and my mother is above-stairs
getting it ready!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>cries Harry. <div class="bookquote">``That poor horse of yours stumbled with
you, and can't go farther this evening.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hush! Your mother won't see him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>), child,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Mountain/Mountain</b></font>)</div>whispered Mrs. Mountain.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not see George? Why, he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) is like a son of the house,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>cries Harry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had best not see him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>). I don't meddle any more in family matters,
child: but when the Colonel's servant rode in, and said you were coming,
Madam Esmond left this room, my dear, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) was sitting reading
Drelincourt, and said she (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) felt she (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) could not see Mr. Washington. Will
you go to her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>Harry took his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) friend's arm, and excusing himself to the
Colonel, to whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) would return in a few minutes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) left the
parlour in which they had assembled, and went to the upper rooms, where
Madam Esmond was.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) was hastening across the corridor, and, with an averted head, passing
by one especial door, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) did not like to look at, for it was that
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) brother's room; but as he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) came to it, Madam Esmond issued from
it, and folded him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) to her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) heart, and led him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) in. A settee was by the
bed, and a book of psalms lay on the coverlet. All the rest of the room
was exactly as George had left it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My poor child! How thin thou art grown--how haggard you look! Never
mind. A mother's care will make thee well again. `Twas nobly done to go
and brave sickness and danger in search of your brother. Had others been
as faithful, he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) might be here now. Never mind, my Harry; our hero will
come back to us,--I know he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) is not dead. One so good, and so brave,
and so gentle, and so clever as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was, I know is not lost to us
altogether.''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>-LRB-Perhaps Harry thought within himself that his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) mother had
not always been accustomed so to speak of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) eldest son.-RRB- <div class="bookquote">``Dry up thy
tears, my dear! He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) will come back to us, I know he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) will come.''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>And when
Harry pressed her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) to give a reason for her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) belief, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had seen
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) father two nights running in a dream, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had told her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) that her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
boy was a prisoner among the Indians.

<p/>Madam Esmond's grief had not prostrated her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) as Harry's had when first
it fell upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>); it had rather stirred and animated her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>): her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) eyes were
eager, her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) countenance angry and revengeful. The lad wondered almost at
the condition in which he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) found his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) mother.

<p/>But when he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) besought her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) to go downstairs, and give a hand of welcome
to George Washington, who had accompanied him (<font color='blue'><b>Washington</b></font>), the lady's excitement
painfully increased. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) should shudder at touching his (<font color='blue'><b>Washington</b></font>) hand.
She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) declared Mr. Washington had taken her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) son from her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) could not
sleep under the same roof with him (<font color='blue'><b>Washington</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) gave me his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) bed when I was ill, mother; and if our George is alive,
how has George Washington a hand in his (<font color='blue'><b>Washington</b></font>) death? Ah! please God it be only
as you say,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>cried Harry, in bewilderment.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If your brother returns, as return he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) will, it will not be through Mr.
Washington's help,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madam Esmond/Madam Esmond Warrington/Madam Warrington</b></font>)</div>said Madam Esmond. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Washington</b></font>) neither defended George on
the field, nor would he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) bring him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) out of it.''

yet ill when he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) gave up his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) bed to me, and was thinking only of his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
friend, when any other man would have thought only of himself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A friend! A pretty friend!''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>sneers the lady. <div class="bookquote">``Of all his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) Excellency's

my boy to him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), the pride of my life, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) will defend with his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>),
forsooth! And he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) leaves my George in the forest, and brings me back
himself! Oh, a pretty welcome I must give him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No gentleman,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>cried Harry, warmly, <div class="bookquote">``was ever refused shelter under my

you like, son, and pay our respects to this one. Will you please to give
me your arm?''  (<font color='red'><b>the widow</b></font>)</div>And taking an arm which was very little able to give her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>)
support, she (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) walked down the broad stairs, and into the apartment where
the Colonel sate.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) made him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) a ceremonious curtsey, and extended one of the little
hands, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) allowed for a moment to rest in his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I wish that our
meeting had been happier, Colonel Washington,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You do not grieve more than I do that it is otherwise, madam,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Colonel</b></font>)</div>said the
Colonel.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I might have wished that the meeting had been spared, that I might not

Mountain, and his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) mother and our good Doctor Dempster, will soon restore
him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>). `Twas scarce necessary, Colonel, that you, who have so many affairs
on your hands, military and domestic, should turn doctor too.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Harry was ill and weak, and I thought it was my duty to ride by him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>),''
 (<font color='red'><b>the Colonel</b></font>)</div>faltered the Colonel.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You yourself, sir, have gone through the fatigues and dangers of the
campaign in the most wonderful manner,''  (<font color='red'><b>the widow</b></font>)</div>said the widow, curtseying
again, and looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) with her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) impenetrable black eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish to Heaven, madam, some one else had come back in my place!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, sir, you have ties which must render your life more than ever
valuable and dear to you, and duties to which, I know, you must be
anxious to betake yourself. In our present deplorable state of doubt and
distress, Castlewood can be a welcome place to no stranger, much less
to you, and so I know, sir, you will be for leaving us ere long. And you
will pardon me if the state of my own spirits obliges me for the most
part to keep my chamber. But my friends here will bear you company as
long as you favour us, whilst I nurse my poor Harry upstairs. Mountain,
you will have the cedar-room on the ground-floor ready for Mr.
Washington, and anything in the house is at his (<font color='blue'><b>Washington</b></font>) command. Farewell, sir.
Will you be pleased to present my compliments to your mother, who will
be thankful to have her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) son safe and sound out of the war,--as also
to my young friend Martha Custis, to whom and to whose children I
wish every happiness. Come, my son!''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>and with these words, and another
freezing curtsey, the pale little woman retreated, looking steadily at
the Colonel, who stood dumb on the floor.

<p/>Strong as Madam Esmond's belief appeared to be respecting her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) son's
safety, the house of Castlewood naturally remained sad and gloomy.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) might forbid mourning for herself and family; but her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) heart was
in black, whatever face the resolute little lady persisted in wearing
before the world. To look for her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) son, was hoping against hope. No
authentic account of his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) death had indeed arrived, and no one appeared
who had seen him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) fall; but hundreds more had been so stricken on that
fatal day, with no eyes to behold their last pangs, save those of the
lurking enemy and the comrades dying by their side. A fortnight after
the defeat, when Harry was absent on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) quest, George's servant,
Sady, reappeared wounded and maimed at Castlewood. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could give
no coherent account of the battle, only of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) flight from the centre,
where he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was with the baggage. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had no news of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) master since the
morning of the action. For many days Sady lurked in the negro quarters
away from the sight of Madam Esmond, whose anger he (<font color='blue'><b>Sady</b></font>) did not dare to
face. That lady's few neighbours spoke of her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) as labouring under a
delusion. So strong was it, that there were times when Harry and the
other members of the little Castlewood family were almost brought to
share in it. It seemed nothing strange to her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>), that her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) father out of
another world should promise her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) son's life. In this world or the
next, that family sure must be of consequence, she (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) thought. Nothing
had ever yet happened to her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) sons, no accident, no fever, no important
illness, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) had a prevision of it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) could enumerate half a dozen
instances, which, indeed, her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) household was obliged more or less to
confirm, how, when anything had happened to the boys at ever so great a
distance, she (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) had known of their mishap and its consequences. No, George
was not dead; George was a prisoner among the Indians; George would come
back and rule over Castlewood; as sure, as sure as his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) Majesty would
send a great force from home to recover the tarnished glory of the
British arms, and to drive the French out of the Americas.

<p/>As for Mr. Washington, she (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) would never with her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) own goodwill behold him (<font color='blue'><b>Washington</b></font>)
again. He (<font color='blue'><b>Washington</b></font>) had promised to protect George with his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) life. Why was her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) son
gone and the Colonel alive? How dared he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) to face her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) after that promise,
and appear before a mother without her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) son? She (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) trusted she (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) knew her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>)
duty. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) bore illwill to no one: but as an Esmond, she (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) had a sense of
honour, and Mr. Washington had forfeited hers in letting her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) son out of
his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) sight. He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) had to obey superior orders -LRB-some one perhaps objected-RRB-?
Psha! a promise was a promise. He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) had promised to guard George's life
with his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) own, and where was her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) boy? And was not the Colonel -LRB-a pretty
Colonel, indeed!-RRB- sound and safe? Do not tell me that his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) coat and hat
had shots through them! -LRB-This was her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) answer to another humble plea in
Mr. Washington's behalf.-RRB- Can't I go into the study this instant and
fire two shots with my papa's pistols through this paduasoy skirt,--and
should I be killed? She (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) laughed at the notion of death resulting from
any such operation; nor was her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) laugh very pleasant to hear. The satire
of people who have little natural humour is seldom good sport for
bystanders. I think dull men's faceticae are mostly cruel.

<p/>So, if Harry wanted to meet his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) friend, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had to do so in secret, at
court-houses, taverns, or various places of resort; or in their little
towns, where the provincial gentry assembled. No man of spirit, she (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>)
vowed, could meet Mr. Washington after his (<font color='blue'><b>Washington</b></font>) base desertion of her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) family.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) was exceedingly excited when she (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) heard that the Colonel and her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) son
absolutely had met. What a heart must Harry have to give his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hand to one
whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) considered as little better than George's murderer! For shame
to say so! For shame upon you, ungrateful boy, forgetting the dearest,
noblest, most perfect of brothers, for that tall, gawky, fox-hunting
Colonel, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) horrid oaths! How can he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) be George's murderer, when
I say my boy is not dead? He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) is not dead, because my instinct never
deceived me: because, as sure as I see his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) picture now before me,--only
`tis not near so noble or so good as he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) used to look,--so surely two
nights running did my papa appear to me in my dreams. You doubt about
that, very likely? `Tis because you never loved anybody sufficiently, my
poor Harry; else you might have leave to see them in dreams, as has been
vouchsafed to some.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think I loved George, mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>cried Harry. <div class="bookquote">``I have often prayed that
I might dream about him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>), and I don't.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How you can talk, sir, of loving George, and then--go and meet your Mr.
Washington at horse-races, I can't understand! Can you, Mountain?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We can't understand many things in our neighbours' characters. I can
understand that our boy is unhappy, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) does not get strength,
and that he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) is doing no good here, in Castlewood, or moping at the
taverns and court-houses with horse-coupers and idle company,''  (<font color='red'><b>patroness</b></font>)</div>grumbled
Mountain in reply to her (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) patroness; and, in truth, the dependant was
right.

<p/>There was not only grief in the Castlewood House, but there was
disunion. <div class="bookquote">``I cannot tell how it came,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>said Harry, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) brought the
story to an end, which we have narrated in the last two numbers,
and which he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) confided to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) new-found English relative, Madame de
Bernstein; <div class="bookquote">``but since that fatal day of July, last year, and my return
home, my mother never has been the same woman. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) seemed to love none
of us as she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) used. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was for ever praising George, and yet she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) did
not seem as if she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) liked him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) much when he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) was with us. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) hath plunged,
more deeply than ever, into her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) books of devotion, out of which she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
only manages to extract grief and sadness, as I think. Such a gloom has
fallen over our wretched Virginian house of Castlewood, that we all
grew ill, and pale as ghosts, who inhabited it. Mountain told me, madam,
that, for nights, my mother would not close her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) eyes. I have had her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) at
my bedside, looking so ghastly, that I have started from my own sleep,
fancying a ghost before me. By one means or other she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) has wrought
herself into a state of excitement which if not delirium, is akin to
it. I was again and again struck down by the fever, and all the Jesuits'
bark in America could not cure me. We have a tobacco-house and some land
about the new town of Richmond, in our province, and went thither, as
Williamsburg is no wholesomer than our own place; and there I mended a
little, but still did not get quite well, and the physicians strongly
counselled a sea-voyage. My mother, at one time, had thoughts of coming
with me, but--''  (<font color='red'><b>Bernstein/Madame de Bernstein/Madame Bernstein</b></font>)</div>-LRB-and here the lad blushed and hung his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) head down-RRB-
<div class="bookquote">``--we did not agree very well, though I know we loved each other very
heartily, and `twas determined that I should see the world for myself.
So I took passage in our ship from the James River, and was landed at
Bristol. And `twas only on the 9th of July, this year, at sea, as had
been agreed between me and Madam Esmond, that I put mourning on for my
dear brother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the lad</b></font>)</div><p/>So that little Mistress of the Virginian Castlewood, for whom, I am
sure, we have all the greatest respect, had the knack of rendering the
people round about her (<font color='blue'><b>Mistress</b></font>) uncomfortable; quarrelled with those she (<font color='blue'><b>Mistress</b></font>) loved
best, and exercised over them her (<font color='blue'><b>Mistress</b></font>) wayward jealousies and imperious
humours, until they were not sorry to leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Mistress</b></font>). Here was money enough,
friends enough, a good position, and the respect of the world; a house
stored with all manner of plenty, and good things, and poor Harry
Warrington was glad to leave them all behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>). Happy! Who is
happy? What good in a stalled ox for dinner every day, and no content
therewith? Is it best to be loved and plagued by those you love, or to
have an easy, comfortable indifference at home; to follow your fancies,
live there unmolested, and die without causing any painful regrets or
tears?

<p/>To be sure, when her (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) boy was gone, Madam Esmond forgot all these little
tiffs and differences. To hear her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) speak of both her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) children, you would
fancy they were perfect characters, and had never caused her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) a moment's
worry or annoyance. These gone, Madam fell naturally upon Mrs. Mountain
and her (<font color='blue'><b>Mountain</b></font>) little daughter, and worried and annoyed them. But women
bear with hard words more easily than men, are more ready to forgive
injuries, or, perhaps, to dissemble anger. Let us trust that Madam
Esmond's dependants found their life tolerable, that they gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>)
ladyship sometimes as good as they got, that if they quarrelled in the
morning they were reconciled at night, and sate down to a tolerably
friendly game at cards and an amicable dish of tea.

<p/>But, without the boys, the great house of Castlewood was dreary to the
widow. She (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) left an overseer there to manage her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) estates, and only paid
the place an occasional visit. She (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) enlarged and beautified her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) house
in the pretty little city of Richmond, which began to grow daily in
importance. She (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) had company there, and card-assemblies, and preachers in
plenty; and set up her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) little throne there, to which the gentlefolks of
the province were welcome to come and bow. All her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) domestic negroes,
who loved society as negroes will do, were delighted to exchange the
solitude of Castlewood for the gay and merry little town; where, for
a time, and while we pursue Harry Warrington's progress in Europe, we
leave the good lady.




<p/>CHAPTER XIV. Harry in England


<p/>When the famous Trojan wanderer narrated his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) escapes and adventures to
Queen Dido, her (<font color='blue'><b>Dido</b></font>) Majesty, as we read, took the very greatest interest
in the fascinating story-teller who told his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) perils so eloquently. A
history ensued, more pathetic than any of the previous occurrences in
the life of Pius Aeneas, and the poor princess had reason to rue the day
when she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) listened to that glib and dangerous orator. Harry Warrington
had not pious Aeneas's power of speech, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) elderly aunt, we may
presume, was by no means so soft-hearted as the sentimental Dido;
but yet the lad's narrative was touching, as he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) delivered it with his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>)
artless eloquence and cordial voice; and more than once, in the course
of his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) story, Madam Bernstein found herself moved to a softness to which
she (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>) had very seldom before allowed herself to give way. There were not
many fountains in that desert of a life--not many sweet, refreshing
resting-places. It had been a long loneliness, for the most part, until
this friendly voice came and sounded in her (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>) ears and caused her (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>) heart to
beat with strange pangs of love and sympathy. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>) doted on this lad,
and on this sense of compassion and regard so new to her (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>). Save once,
faintly, in very very early youth, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>) had felt no tender sentiment for
any human being. Such a woman would, no doubt, watch her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) own sensations
very keenly, and must have smiled after the appearance of this boy, to
mark how her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) pulses rose above their ordinary beat. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) longed after
him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) felt her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) cheeks flush with happiness when he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) came near. Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
eyes greeted him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) with welcome, and followed him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) with fond pleasure. <div class="bookquote">``Ah,
if she (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) could have had a son like that, how she (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) would have loved him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Wait,''  (<font color='red'><b>scoffer</b></font>)</div>says Conscience, the dark scoffer mocking within her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``wait,
Beatrix Esmond! You know you will weary of this inclination, as you have
of all. You know, when the passing fancy has subsided, that the boy may
perish, and you won't have a tear for him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>); or talk, and you weary of
his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) stories; and that your lot in life is to be lonely--lonely.''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>Well?
suppose life be a desert? There are halting-places and shades, and
refreshing waters; let us profit by them for to-day. We know that we
must march when to-morrow comes, and tramp on our destiny onward.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) smiled inwardly, whilst following the lad's narrative, to recognise
in his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) simple tales about his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) mother, traits of family resemblance.
Madam Esmond was very jealous?--Yes, that Harry owned. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) was fond of
Colonel Washington? She (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) liked him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), but only as a friend, Harry declared.
A hundred times he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had heard his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) mother vow that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had no other
feeling towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was ashamed to have to own that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) himself had
been once absurdly jealous of the Colonel. <div class="bookquote">``Well, you will see that my
half-sister will never forgive him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Madam Beatrix/Beatrix</b></font>)</div>said Madam Beatrix. <div class="bookquote">``And you need
not be surprised, sir, at women taking a fancy to men younger than
themselves; for don't I dote upon you; and don't all these Castlewood
people crevent with jealousy?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Bernstein/Madame de Bernstein/Madame Bernstein</b></font>)</div><p/>However great might be their jealousy of Madame de Bernstein's new
favourite, the family of Castlewood allowed no feeling of illwill to
appear in their language or behaviour to their young guest and
kinsman. After a couple of days' stay in the ancestral house, Mr.
Harry Warrington had become Cousin Harry with young and middle-aged.
Especially in Madame Bernstein's presence, the Countess of Castlewood
was most gracious to her (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) kinsman, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) took many amiable private
opportunities of informing the Baroness how charming the young Huron
was, of vaunting the elegance of his (<font color='blue'><b>kinsman</b></font>) manners and appearance, and
wondering how, in his (<font color='blue'><b>kinsman</b></font>) distant province, the child should ever have
learned to be so polite?

<p/>These notes of admiration or interrogation, the Baroness took with
equal complacency -LRB-speaking parenthetically, and, for his (<font color='blue'><b>kinsman</b></font>) own part, the
present chronicler cannot help putting in a little respectful remark
here, and signifying his (<font color='blue'><b>kinsman</b></font>) admiration of the conduct of ladies towards one
another, and of the things which they say, which they forbear to say,
and which they say behind each other's backs. With what smiles and
curtseys they stab each other! with what compliments they hate each
other! with what determination of long-suffering they won't be offended!
with what innocent dexterity they can drop the drop of poison into the
cup of conversation, hand round the goblet, smiling, to the whole family
to drink, and make the dear, domestic circle miserable!-RRB---I burst out of
my parenthesis. I fancy my Baroness and Countess smiling at each other
a hundred years ago, and giving each other the hand or the cheek, and
calling each other, My dear, My dear creature, My dear Countess, My dear
Baroness, My dear sister--even, when they were most ready to fight.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You wonder, my dear Maria, that the boy should be so polite?''  (<font color='red'><b>Bernstein/Madame de Bernstein/Madame Bernstein</b></font>)</div>cries
Madame de Bernstein. <div class="bookquote">``His (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) mother was bred up by two very perfect
gentlefolks. Colonel Esmond had a certain grave courteousness, and a
grand manner, which I do not see among the gentlemen nowadays.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Eh, my dear, we all of us praise our own time! My grandmamma used to
declare there was nothing like Whitehall and Charles the Second.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My mother saw King James the Second's court for a short while, and
though not a court-educated person, as you know,--her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) father was a
country clergyman--yet was exquisitely well-bred. The Colonel, her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
second husband, was a person of great travel and experience, as well as
of learning, and had frequented the finest company of Europe. They could
not go into their retreat and leave their good manners behind them, and
our boy has had them as his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) natural inheritance.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, excuse me, my dear, for thinking you too partial about your
mother. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) could not have been that perfection which your filial
fondness imagines. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) left off liking her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) daughter--my dear creature,
you have owned that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) did--and I cannot fancy a complete woman who has
a cold heart. No, no, my dear sister-in-law! Manners are very requisite,
no doubt, and, for a country parson's daughter, your mamma was very
well--I have seen many of the cloth who are very well. Mr. Sampson, our
chaplain, is very well. Dr. Young is very well. Mr. Dodd is very well;
but they have not the true air--as how should they? I protest, I beg
pardon! I forgot my lord bishop, your ladyship's first choice. But, as I
said before, to be a complete woman, one must have, what you have, what
I may say and bless Heaven for, I think I have--a good heart. Without
the affections, all the world is vanity, my love! I protest I only live,
exist, eat, drink, rest, for my sweet, sweet children!--for my wicked
Willy, for my self-willed Fanny, dear naughty loves!''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>-LRB-She (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>)
rapturously kisses a bracelet on each arm which contains the miniature
representations of those two young persons.-RRB- <div class="bookquote">``Yes, Mimi! yes, Fanchon!
you know I do, you dear, dear little things! and if they were to die,
or you were to die, your poor mistress would die too!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mimi</b></font>)</div>Mimi and Fanchon,
two quivering Italian greyhounds, jump into their lady's arms, and kiss
her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) hands, but respect her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) cheeks, which are covered with rouge. <div class="bookquote">``No,
my dear! For nothing do I bless Heaven so much -LRB-though it puts me
to excruciating torture very often-RRB- as for having endowed me with
sensibility and a feeling heart!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are full of feeling, dear Anna,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Baroness</b></font>)</div>says the Baroness. <div class="bookquote">``You are
celebrated for your sensibility. You must give a little of it to our
American nephew--cousin--I scarce know his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) relationship.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, I am here but as a guest in Castlewood now. The house is my Lord
Castlewood's, not mine, or his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) lordship's whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) shall choose to
claim it. What can I do for the young Virginian that has not been done?
He (<font color='blue'><b>Virginian</b></font>) is charming. Are we even jealous of him (<font color='blue'><b>Virginian</b></font>) for being so, my dear? and
though we see what a fancy the Baroness de Bernstein has taken for him (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>),
do your ladyship's nephews and nieces--your real nephews and nieces--cry
out? My poor children might be mortified, for indeed, in a few hours,
the charming young man has made as much way as my poor things have been
able to do in all their lives: but are they angry? Willy hath taken him (<font color='blue'><b>Willy</b></font>)
out to ride. This morning, was not Maria playing the harpsichord whilst
my Fanny taught him (<font color='blue'><b>Willy</b></font>) the minuet? `Twas a charming young group, I assure
you, and it brought tears into my eyes to look at the young creatures.
Poor lad! we are as fond of him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) as you are, dear Baroness!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Bernstein/Madame de Bernstein/Madame Bernstein</b></font>)</div><p/>Now, Madame de Bernstein had happened, through her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) own ears or her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>)
maid's, to overhear what really took place in consequence of this
harmless little scene. Lady Castlewood had come into the room where the
young people were thus engaged in amusing and instructing themselves,
accompanied by her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) son William, who arrived in his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) boots from the
kennel.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Bravi, bravi! Oh, charming!''  (<font color='red'><b>the Countess</b></font>)</div>said the Countess, clapping her (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) hands,
nodding with one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) best smiles to Harry Warrington, and darting a
look at his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) partner, which my Lady Fanny perfectly understood; and
so, perhaps, did my Lady Maria at her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) harpsichord, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) played with
redoubled energy, and nodded her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) waving curls, over the chords.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Infernal young Choctaw! Is he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) teaching Fanny the war-dance? and is Fan
going to try her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) tricks upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Fan</b></font>) now?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. William/William/William Esmond</b></font>)</div>asked Mr. William, whose temper
was not of the best.

<p/>And that was what Lady Castlewood's look said to Fanny. <div class="bookquote">``Are you going
to try your tricks upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Fan</b></font>) now?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) made Harry a very low curtsey, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) blushed, and they both stopped
dancing, somewhat disconcerted. Lady Maria rose from the harpsichord and
walked away.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, go on dancing, young people! Don't let me spoil sport, and let me
play for you,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Countess</b></font>)</div>said the Countess; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) sate down to the instrument
and played.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know how to dance,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>says Harry, hanging his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) head down, with a
blush that the Countess's finest carmine could not equal.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And Fanny was teaching you? Go on teaching him (<font color='blue'><b>Fan</b></font>), dearest Fanny!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Go on, do!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. William/William/William Esmond</b></font>)</div>says William, with a sidelong growl.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I--I had rather not show off my awkwardness in company,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>adds Harry,
recovering himself. <div class="bookquote">``When I know how to dance a minuet, be sure I will
ask my cousin to walk one with me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That will be very soon, dear Cousin Warrington, I am certain,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Countess</b></font>)</div>remarks
the Countess, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) most gracious air.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What game is she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) hunting now?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. William/William/William Esmond</b></font>)</div>thinks Mr. William to himself, who
cannot penetrate his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) mother's ways; and that lady, fondly calling her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
daughter to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) elbow, leaves the room.

<p/>They are no sooner in the tapestried passage leading away to their
own apartment, but Lady Castlewood's bland tone entirely changes. <div class="bookquote">``You
booby!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Castlewood</b></font>) begins to her (<font color='blue'><b>Castlewood</b></font>) adored Fanny. <div class="bookquote">``You double idiot! What are
you going to do with the Huron? You don't want to marry a creature like
that, and be a squaw in a wigwam?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't, mamma!''  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Lady Fanny</b></font>)</div>gasps Lady Fanny. Mamma was pinching her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) ladyship's arm
black-and-blue. <div class="bookquote">``I am sure our cousin is very well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Lady Fanny</b></font>)</div>Fanny whimpers,
<div class="bookquote">``and you said so yourself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Lady Fanny</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well! Yes; and heir to a swamp, a negro, a log-cabin and a barrel
of tobacco! My Lady Frances Esmond, do you remember what your ladyship's
rank is, and what your name is, and who was your ladyship's mother,
when, at three days' acquaintance, you commence dancing--a pretty dance,
indeed--with this brat out of Virginia?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Warrington is our cousin,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Lady Fanny</b></font>)</div>pleads Lady Fanny.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A creature come from nobody knows where is not your cousin! How do we
know he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) is your cousin? He (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) may be a valet who has taken his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) master's
portmanteau, and run away in his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) postchaise.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But Madame de Bernstein says he (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>) is our cousin,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Lady Fanny</b></font>)</div>interposes Fanny; <div class="bookquote">``and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>) is the image of the Esmonds.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Lady Fanny</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Madame de Bernstein has her (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>) likes and dislikes, takes up people and
forgets people; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>) chooses to profess a mighty fancy for this young
man. Because she (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>) likes him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to-day, is that any reason why she (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>) should
like him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to-morrow? Before company, and in your aunt's presence,
your ladyship will please to be as civil to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) as necessary; but, in
private, I forbid you to see him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) or encourage him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't care, madam, whether your ladyship forbids me or not!''  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Lady Fanny</b></font>)</div>cries
out Lady Fanny, wrought up to a pitch of revolt.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very good, Fanny! then I speak to my lord, and we return to Kensington.
If I can't bring you to reason, your brother will.''

 (<font color='red'><b>mother daughter</b></font>)</div><p/>At this juncture the conversation between mother and daughter stopped,
or Madame de Bernstein's informer had no further means of hearing or
reporting it.

<p/>It was only in after days that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) told Harry Warrington a part of what
she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) knew. At present he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) but saw that his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) kinsfolks received him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) not
unkindly. Lady Castlewood was perfectly civil to him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>); the young ladies
pleasant and pleased; my Lord Castlewood, a man of cold and haughty
demeanour, was not more reserved towards Harry than to any of the rest
of the family; Mr. William was ready to drink with him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>), to ride with
him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>), to go to races with him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>), and to play cards with him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>). When he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>)
proposed to go away, they one and all pressed him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) to stay. Madame de
Bernstein did not tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>) how it arose that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>) was the object of
such eager hospitality. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>) did not know what schemes he (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>) was serving or
disarranging, whose or what anger he (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>) was creating. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>) fancied he (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>) was
welcome because those around him (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>) were his (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>) kinsmen, and never thought
that those could be his (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>) enemies out of whose cup he (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>) was drinking, and
whose hand he (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>) was pressing every night and morning.




<p/>CHAPTER XV. A Sunday at Castlewood


<p/>The second day after Harry's arrival at Castlewood was a Sunday. The
chapel appertaining to the castle was the village church. A door from
the house communicated with a great state pew which the family occupied,
and here after due time they all took their places in order, whilst a
rather numerous congregation from the village filled the seats below. A
few ancient dusty banners hung from the church roof; and Harry pleased
himself in imagining that they had been borne by retainers of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) family
in the Commonwealth wars, in which, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) knew well, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) ancestors had
taken a loyal and distinguished part. Within the altar-rails was the
effigy of the Esmond of the time of King James the First, the common
forefather of all the group assembled in the family pew. Madame de
Bernstein, in her (<font color='blue'><b>family</b></font>) quality of Bishop's widow, never failed in attendance,
and conducted her (<font color='blue'><b>family</b></font>) devotions with a gravity almost as exemplary as that
of the ancestor yonder, in his (<font color='blue'><b>ancestor</b></font>) square beard and red gown, for ever
kneeling on his (<font color='blue'><b>ancestor</b></font>) stone hassock before his (<font color='blue'><b>ancestor</b></font>) great marble desk and
book, under his (<font color='blue'><b>ancestor</b></font>) emblazoned shield of arms. The clergyman, a tall,
high-coloured, handsome young man, read the service in a lively,
agreeable voice, giving almost a dramatic point to the chapters of
Scripture which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) read. The music was good--one of the young ladies
of the family touching the organ--and would have been better but for an
interruption and something like a burst of laughter from the servants'
pew, which was occasioned by Mr. Warrington's lacquey Gumbo, who,
knowing the air given out for the psalm, began to sing it in a voice so
exceedingly loud and sweet, that the whole congregation turned towards
the African warbler; the parson himself put his (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) handkerchief to his (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>)
mouth, and the liveried gentlemen from London were astonished out of all
propriety. Pleased, perhaps, with the sensation which he (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) had created,
Mr. Gumbo continued his (<font color='blue'><b>Gumbo</b></font>) performance until it became almost a solo, and
the voice of the clerk himself was silenced. For the truth is, that
though Gumbo held on to the book, along with pretty Molly, the porter's
daughter, who had been the first to welcome the strangers to Castlewood,
he (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) sang and recited by ear and not by note, and could not read a
syllable of the verses in the book before him (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>).

<p/>This choral performance over, a brief sermon in due course followed,
which, indeed, Harry thought a deal too short. In a lively, familiar,
striking discourse the clergyman described a scene of which he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) had
been witness the previous week--the execution of a horse-stealer after
Assizes. He (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) described the man and his (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) previous good character, his (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>)
family, the love they bore one another, and his (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) agony at parting from
them. He (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) depicted the execution in a manner startling, terrible,
and picturesque. He (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) did not introduce into his (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) sermon the Scripture
phraseology, such as Harry had been accustomed to hear it from those
somewhat Calvinistic preachers whom his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) mother loved to frequent, but
rather spoke as one man of the world to other sinful people, who might
be likely to profit by good advice. The unhappy man just gone, had begun
as a farmer of good prospects; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had taken to drinking, card-playing,
horse-racing, cock-fighting, the vices of the age; against which the
young clergyman was generously indignant. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) had got to poaching
and to horse-stealing, for which he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) suffered. The divine rapidly drew
striking and fearful pictures of these rustic crimes. He (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) startled his (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>)
hearers by showing that the Eye of the Law was watching the poacher
at midnight, and setting traps to catch the criminal. He (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) galloped the
stolen horse over highway and common, and from one county into another,
but showed Retribution ever galloping after, seizing the malefactor in
the country fair, carrying him (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) before the justice, and never unlocking
his (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) manacles till he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) dropped them at the gallows-foot. Heaven be pitiful
to the sinner! The clergyman acted the scene. He (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) whispered in the
criminal's ear at the cart. He (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) dropped his (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) handkerchief on the clerk's
head. Harry started back as that handkerchief dropped. The clergyman had
been talking for more than twenty minutes. Harry could have heard
him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) for an hour more, and thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had not been five minutes in the
pulpit. The gentlefolks in the great pew were very much enlivened by the
discourse. Once or twice, Harry, who could see the pew where the house
servants sate, remarked these very attentive; and especially Gumbo, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
own man, in an attitude of intense consternation. But the smockfrocks
did not seem to heed, and clamped out of church quite unconcerned.
Gaffer Brown and Gammer Jones took the matter as it came, and the
rosy-cheeked, red-cloaked village lasses sate under their broad
hats entirely unmoved. My lord, from his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) pew, nodded slightly to the
clergyman in the pulpit, when that divine's head and wig surged up from
the cushion.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sampson has been strong to-day,''  (<font color='red'><b>lordship</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) lordship. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) has assaulted
the Philistines in great force.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Beautiful, beautiful!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>says Harry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Bet five to four it was his (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) Assize sermon. He (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) has been over to Winton
to preach, and to see those dogs,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. William/William/William Esmond</b></font>)</div>cries William.

<p/>The organist had played the little congregation out into the sunshine.
Only Sir Francis Esmond, temp. Jac. I., still knelt on his (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) marble
hassock, before his (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) prayer-book of stone. Mr. Sampson came out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>)
vestry in his (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) cassock, and nodded to the gentlemen still lingering in
the great pew.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come up, and tell us about those dogs,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. William/William/William Esmond</b></font>)</div>says Mr. William, and the
divine nodded a laughing assent.

<p/>The gentlemen passed out of the church into the gallery of their house,
which connected them with that sacred building. Mr. Sampson made his (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>)
way through the court, and presently joined them. He (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) was presented by my
lord to the Virginian cousin of the family, Mr. Warrington: the chaplain
bowed very profoundly, and hoped Mr. Warrington would benefit by the
virtuous example of his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) European kinsmen. Was he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) related to Sir Miles
Warrington of Norfolk? Sir Miles was Mr. Warrington's father's elder
brother. What a pity he (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) had a son! `Twas a pretty estate, and Mr.
Warrington looked as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) would become a baronetcy, and a fine estate
in Norfolk.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell me about my uncle,''  (<font color='red'><b>Virginian</b></font>)</div>cried Virginian Harry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell us about those dogs!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said English Will, in a breath.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Two more jolly dogs, two more drunken dogs, saving your presence, Mr.
Warrington, than Sir Miles and his (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) son, I never saw. Sir Miles was a
staunch friend and neighbour of Sir Robert's. He (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) can drink down any man
in the county, except his (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) son and a few more. The other dogs about which
Mr. William is anxious, for Heaven hath made him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) a prey to dogs and all
kinds of birds, like the Greeks in the Iliad--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know that line in the Iliad,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>says Harry, blushing. <div class="bookquote">``I only know five
more, but I know that one.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>And his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) head fell. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was thinking, <div class="bookquote">``Ah, my
dear brother George knew all the Iliad and all the Odyssey, and almost
every book that was ever written besides!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What on earth''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>-LRB-only he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) mentioned a place under the earth-RRB- <div class="bookquote">``are you
talking about now?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>asked Will of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) reverence.

<p/>The chaplain reverted to the dogs and their performance. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) thought Mr.
William's dogs were more than a match for them. From dogs they went off
to horses. Mr. William was very eager about the Six Year Old Plate at
Huntingdon. <div class="bookquote">``Have you brought any news of it, Parson?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The odds are five to four on Brilliant against the field,''  (<font color='red'><b>the parson</b></font>)</div>says the
parson, gravely, <div class="bookquote">``but, mind you, Jason is a good horse.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the parson</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Whose horse?''  (<font color='red'><b>lord</b></font>)</div>asks my lord.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Duke of Ancaster's. By Cartouche out of Miss Langley,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>says the divine.
<div class="bookquote">``Have you horse-races in Virginia, Mr. Warrington?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Haven't we!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>cries Harry; <div class="bookquote">``but oh! I long to see a good English race!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you--do you--bet a little?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>continues his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) reverence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have done such a thing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>replies Harry with a smile.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll take Brilliant even against the field, for ponies with you,
cousin!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. William/William/William Esmond</b></font>)</div>shouts out Mr. William.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll give or take three to one against Jason!''  (<font color='red'><b>the clergyman</b></font>)</div>says the clergyman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't bet on horses I don't know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>said Harry, wondering to hear the
chaplain now, and remembering his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) sermon half an hour before.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hadn't you better write home, and ask your mother?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. William/William/William Esmond</b></font>)</div>says Mr. William,
with a sneer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Will, Will!''  (<font color='red'><b>lord</b></font>)</div>calls out my lord, <div class="bookquote">``our cousin Warrington is free to bet,
or not, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) likes. Have a care how you venture on either of them,
Harry Warrington. Will is an old file, in spite of his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) smooth face, and
as for Parson Sampson, I defy our ghostly enemy to get the better of
him (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>lord</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Him (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) and all his (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) works, my lord!''  (<font color='red'><b>Sampson/Mr. Sampson</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Sampson, with a bow.

<p/>Harry was highly indignant at this allusion to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) mother. <div class="bookquote">``I'll tell
you what, cousin Will,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I am in the habit of managing my own
affairs in my own way, without asking any lady to arrange them for me.
And I'm used to make my own bets upon my own judgment, and don't need
any relations to select them for me, thank you. But as I am your
guest, and, no doubt, you want to show me hospitality, I'll take your
bet--there. And so Done and Done.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Done,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>says Will, looking askance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course it is the regular odds that's in the paper which you give me,
cousin?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, no, it isn't,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>growled Will. <div class="bookquote">``The odds are five to four, that's
the fact, and you may have `em, if you like.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, cousin, a bet is a bet; and I take you, too, Mr. Sampson.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Three to one against Jason. I lay it. Very good,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sampson/Mr. Sampson</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Sampson.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it to be ponies too, Mr. Chaplain?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>asks Harry with a superb air, as
if he (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) had Lombard Street in his (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) pocket.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no. Thirty to ten. It is enough for a poor priest to win.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Here goes a great slice out of my quarter's hundred,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>thinks Harry.
<div class="bookquote">``Well, I shan't let these Englishmen fancy that I am afraid of them. I
didn't begin, but for the honour of Old Virginia I won't go back.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. William/William/William Esmond</b></font>)</div><p/>These pecuniary transactions arranged, William Esmond went away scowling
towards the stables, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) loved to take his (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) pipe with the grooms;
the brisk parson went off to pay his (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) court to the ladies, and partake of
the Sunday dinner which would presently be served. Lord Castlewood and
Harry remained for a while together. Since the Virginian's arrival
my lord had scarcely spoken with him (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>). In his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) manners he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) was perfectly
friendly, but so silent that he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) would often sit at the head of his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>)
table, and leave it without uttering a word.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose yonder property of yours is a fine one by this time?''  (<font color='red'><b>lord</b></font>)</div>said my
lord to Harry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I reckon it's almost as big as an English county,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>answered Harry, <div class="bookquote">``and
the land's as good, too, for many things.''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>Harry would not have the Old
Dominion, nor his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) share in it, underrated.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed!''  (<font color='red'><b>lord</b></font>)</div>said my lord, with a look of surprise. <div class="bookquote">``When it belonged to my
father it did not yield much.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pardon me, my lord. You know how it belonged to your father,''  (<font color='red'><b>the youth</b></font>)</div>cried the
youth, with some spirit. <div class="bookquote">``It was because my grandfather did not choose
to claim his (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) right.''  (<font color='red'><b>the Author</b></font>)</div>-LSB-This matter is discussed in the Author's previous
work, The Memoirs of Colonel Esmond.-RSB-

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course, of course,''  (<font color='red'><b>lord</b></font>)</div>says my lord, hastily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I mean, cousin, that we of the Virginian house owe you nothing but
our own,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>continued Harry Warrington; <div class="bookquote">``but our own, and the hospitality
which you are now showing me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are heartily welcome to both. You were hurt by the betting just
now?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lad</b></font>)</div>replied the lad, <div class="bookquote">``I am sort o' hurt. Your welcome, you see, is
different to our welcome, and that's the fact. At home we are glad to
see a man, hold out a hand to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and give him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) of our best. Here you
take us in, give us beef and claret enough, to be sure, and don't seem
to care when we come, or when we go. That's the remark which I have been
making since I have been in your lordship's house; I can't help telling
it out, you see, now `tis on my mind; and I think I am a little easier
now I have said it.''  (<font color='red'><b>the lad</b></font>)</div>And with this, the excited young fellow knocked
a billiard-ball across the table, and then laughed, and looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>)
elder kinsman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A la bonne heure! We are cold to the stranger within and without our
gates. We don't take Mr. Harry Warrington into our arms, and cry when we
see our cousin. We don't cry when he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) goes away--but do we pretend?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, you don't. But you try to get the better of him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) in a bet,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>says
Harry, indignantly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is there no such practice in Virginia, and don't sporting men there try
to overreach one another? What was that story I heard you telling our
aunt, of the British officers and Tom somebody of Spotsylvania!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's fair!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>cries Harry. <div class="bookquote">``That is, it's usual practice, and a
stranger must look out. I don't mind the parson; if he (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) wins, he (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) may
have, and welcome. But a relation! To think that my own blood cousin
wants money out of me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A Newmarket man would get the better of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) father. My brother has
been on the turf since he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) rode over to it from Cambridge. If you play at
cards with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)--and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) will if you will let him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)--he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) will beat you if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
can.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I'm ready!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>cries Harry. <div class="bookquote">``I'll play any game with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) that I
know, or I'll jump with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), or I'll ride with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), or I'll row with
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), or I'll wrestle with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), or I'll shoot with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)--there--now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div><p/>The senior was greatly entertained, and held out his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hand to the boy.
<div class="bookquote">``Anything, but don't fight with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>lord</b></font>)</div>said my lord.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If I do, I'll whip him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)! hanged if I don't!''  (<font color='red'><b>the lad</b></font>)</div>cried the lad. But a look
of surprise and displeasure on the nobleman's part recalled him (<font color='blue'><b>nobleman</b></font>) to
better sentiments. <div class="bookquote">``A hundred pardons, my lord!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>nobleman</b></font>) said, blushing very
red, and seizing his (<font color='blue'><b>nobleman</b></font>) cousin's hand. <div class="bookquote">``I talked of ill manners, being
angry and hurt just now; but `tis doubly ill-mannered of me to show my
anger, and boast about my prowess to my own host and kinsman. It's not
the practice with us Americans to boast, believe me, it's not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are the first I ever met,''  (<font color='red'><b>lord</b></font>)</div>says my lord, with a smile, <div class="bookquote">``and I take
you at your word. And I give you fair warning about the cards, and the
betting, that is all, my boy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>lord</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Leave a Virginian alone! We are a match for most men, we are,''  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div>resumed
the boy.

<p/>Lord Castlewood did not laugh. His (<font color='blue'><b>Castlewood</b></font>) eyebrows only arched for a moment,
and his (<font color='blue'><b>Castlewood</b></font>) grey eyes turned towards the ground. <div class="bookquote">``So you can bet fifty
guineas, and afford to lose them? So much the better for you, cousin.
Those great Virginian estates yield a great revenue, do they?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``More than sufficient for all of us--for ten times as many as we are
now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>replied Harry. -LRB-<div class="bookquote">``What, he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) is pumping me,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lad</b></font>)</div>thought the lad.-RRB-

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And your mother makes her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) son and heir a handsome allowance?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``As much as ever I choose to draw, my lord!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>cried Harry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Peste! I wish I had such a mother!''  (<font color='red'><b>lord</b></font>)</div>cried my lord. <div class="bookquote">``But I have only the
advantage of a stepmother, and she (<font color='blue'><b>stepmother</b></font>) draws me. There is the dinner-bell.
Shall we go into the eating-room?''  (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div>And taking his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) young friend's arm, my
lord led him (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) to the apartment where that meal was waiting.

<p/>Parson Sampson formed the delight of the entertainment, and amused the
ladies with a hundred agreeable stories. Besides being chaplain to his (<font color='blue'><b>chaplain</b></font>)
lordship, he (<font color='blue'><b>chaplain</b></font>) was a preacher in London, at the new chapel in Mayfair, for
which my Lady Whittlesea -LRB-so well known in the reign of George I.-RRB- had
left an endowment. He (<font color='blue'><b>I.</b></font>) had the choicest stories of all the clubs and
coteries--the very latest news of who had run away with whom--the last
bon-mot of Mr. Selwyn--the last wild bet of March and Rockingham. He (<font color='blue'><b>Selwyn</b></font>)
knew how the old king had quarrelled with Madame Walmoden, and the Duke
was suspected of having a new love; who was in favour at Carlton House
with the Princess of Wales, and who was hung last Monday, and how
well he (<font color='blue'><b>House</b></font>) behaved in the cart. My lord's chaplain poured out all this
intelligence to the amused ladies and the delighted young provincial,
seasoning his (<font color='blue'><b>chaplain</b></font>) conversation with such plain terms and lively jokes as
made Harry stare, who was newly arrived from the colonies, and unused to
the elegances of London life. The ladies, old and young, laughed quite
cheerfully at the lively jokes. Do not be frightened, ye fair readers
of the present day! We are not going to outrage your sweet modesties,
or call blushes on your maiden cheeks. But `tis certain that their
ladyships at Castlewood never once thought of being shocked, but sate
listening to the parson's funny tales, until the chapel bell, clinking
for afternoon service, summoned his (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) reverence away for half an hour.
There was no sermon. He (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) would be back in the drinking of a bottle of
Burgundy. Mr. Will called a fresh one, and the chaplain tossed off a
glass ere he (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) ran out.

<p/>Ere the half-hour was over, Mr. Chaplain was back again bawling for
another bottle. This discussed, they joined the ladies, and a couple
of card-tables were set out, as, indeed, they were for many hours every
day, at which the whole of the family party engaged. Madame de Bernstein
could beat any one of her (<font color='blue'><b>party</b></font>) kinsfolk at piquet, and there was only Mr.
Chaplain in the whole circle who was at all a match for her (<font color='blue'><b>party</b></font>) ladyship.

<p/>In this easy manner the Sabbath-day passed. The evening was beautiful,
and there was talk of adjourning to a cool tankard and a game of whist
in a summer-house; but the company voted to sit indoors, the ladies
declaring they thought the aspect of three honours in their hand,
and some good court-cards, more beautiful than the loveliest scene of
nature; and so the sun went behind the elms, and still they were at
their cards; and the rooks came home cawing their evensong, and they
never stirred except to change partners; and the chapel clock tolled
hour after hour unheeded, so delightfully were they spent over the
pasteboard; and the moon and stars came out; and it was nine o’clock,
and the groom of the chambers announced that supper was ready.

<p/>Whilst they sate at that meal, the postboy's twanging horn was heard,
as he (<font color='blue'><b>groom</b></font>) trotted into the village with his (<font color='blue'><b>groom</b></font>) letter-bag. My lord's bag was
brought in presently from the village, and his (<font color='blue'><b>groom</b></font>) letters, which he (<font color='blue'><b>groom</b></font>) put
aside, and his (<font color='blue'><b>groom</b></font>) newspaper which he (<font color='blue'><b>groom</b></font>) read. He (<font color='blue'><b>groom</b></font>) smiled as he (<font color='blue'><b>groom</b></font>) came to a
paragraph, looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>groom</b></font>) Virginian cousin, and handed the paper over
to his (<font color='blue'><b>groom</b></font>) brother Will, who by this time was very comfortable, having had
pretty good luck all the evening, and a great deal of liquor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Read that, Will,''  (<font color='red'><b>lord</b></font>)</div>says my lord.

<p/>Mr. William took the paper, and, reading the sentence pointed out by his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>)
brother, uttered an exclamation which caused all the ladies to cry out.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Gracious heavens, William! What has happened?''  (<font color='red'><b>the sister</b></font>)</div>cries one or the other
fond sister.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mercy, child, why do you swear so dreadfully?''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>asks the young man's
fond mamma.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What's the matter?''  (<font color='red'><b>Bernstein/Madame de Bernstein/Madame Bernstein</b></font>)</div>inquires Madame de Bernstein, who has fallen into a
doze after her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) usual modicum of punch and beer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Read it, Parson!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. William/William/William Esmond</b></font>)</div>says Mr. William, thrusting the paper over to the
chaplain, and looking as fierce as a Turk.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Bit, by the Lord!''  (<font color='red'><b>the chaplain</b></font>)</div>roars the chaplain, dashing down the paper.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Cousin Harry, you are in luck,''  (<font color='red'><b>lord</b></font>)</div>said my lord, taking up the sheet, and
reading from it. <div class="bookquote">``The Six Year Old Plate at Huntingdon was won by Jason,
beating Brilliant, Pytho, and Ginger. The odds were five to four on
Brilliant against the field, three to one against Jason, seven to two
against Pytho, and twenty to one against Ginger.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I owe you a half-year's income of my poor living, Mr. Warrington,''
 (<font color='red'><b>the parson</b></font>)</div>groaned the parson. <div class="bookquote">``I will pay when my noble patron settles with me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A curse upon the luck!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. William/William/William Esmond</b></font>)</div>growls Mr. William; <div class="bookquote">``that comes of betting on a
Sunday,'' (<font color='red'><b>Mr. William/William/William Esmond</b></font>)</div>--and he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) sought consolation in another great bumper.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, cousin Will. It was but in jest,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>cried Harry. <div class="bookquote">``I can't think of
taking my cousin's money.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Curse me, sir, do you suppose, if I lose, I can't pay?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. William/William/William Esmond</b></font>)</div>asks Mr.
William; <div class="bookquote">``and that I want to be beholden to any man alive? That is a
good joke. Isn't it, Parson?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. William/William/William Esmond</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think I have heard better,''  (<font color='red'><b>the clergyman</b></font>)</div>said the clergyman; to which William
replied, <div class="bookquote">``Hang it, let us have another bowl.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. William/William/William Esmond</b></font>)</div><p/>Let us hope the ladies did not wait for this last replenishment of
liquor, for it is certain they had had plenty already during the
evening.




<p/>CHAPTER XVI. In which Gumbo shows Skill with the Old English Weapon


<p/>Our young Virginian having won these sums of money from his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) cousin and
the chaplain, was in duty bound to give them a chance of recovering
their money, and I am afraid his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) mamma and other sound moralists would
scarcely approve of his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) way of life. He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) plays at cards a great deal too
much. Besides the daily whist or quadrille with the ladies, which set in
soon after dinner at three o’clock, and lasted until supper-time, there
occurred games involving the gain or loss of very considerable sums of
money, in which all the gentlemen, my lord included, took part. Since
their Sunday's conversation, his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) lordship was more free and confidential
with his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) kinsman than he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) had previously been, betted with him (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) quite
affably, and engaged him (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) at backgammon and piquet. Mr. William and the
pious chaplain liked a little hazard; though this diversion was enjoyed
on the sly, and unknown to the ladies of the house, who had exacted
repeated promises from cousin Will that he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) would not lead the Virginian
into mischief, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) would himself keep out of it. So Will
promised as much as his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) aunt or his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) mother chose to demand from him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>),
gave them his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) word that he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) would never play--no, never; and when the
family retired to rest, Mr. Will would walk over with a dice-box and
a rum-bottle to cousin Harry's quarters, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), and Hal, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
reverence would sit and play until daylight.

<p/>When Harry gave to Lord Castlewood those flourishing descriptions of the
maternal estate in America, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had not wished to mislead his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) kinsman,
or to boast, or to tell falsehoods, for the lad was of a very honest and
truth-telling nature; but, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) life at home, it must be owned
that the young fellow had had acquaintance with all sorts of queer
company,--horse-jockeys, tavern loungers, gambling and sporting men,
of whom a great number were found in his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) native colony. A landed
aristocracy, with a population of negroes to work their fields, and
cultivate their tobacco and corn, had little other way of amusement
than in the hunting-field, or over the cards and the punch-bowl. The
hospitality of the province was unbounded: every man's house was his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
neighbour's; and the idle gentlefolks rode from one mansion to another,
finding in each pretty much the same sport, welcome, and rough plenty.
The Virginian squire had often a barefooted valet, and a cobbled saddle;
but there was plenty of corn for the horses, and abundance of drink and
venison for the master within the tumble-down fences, and behind the
cracked windows of the hall. Harry had slept on many a straw mattress,
and engaged in endless jolly night-bouts over claret and punch in
cracked bowls till morning came, and it was time to follow the hounds.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) poor brother was of a much more sober sort, as the lad owned with
contrition. So it is that Nature makes folks; and some love books and
tea, and some like Burgundy and a gallop across country. Our young
fellow's tastes were speedily made visible to his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) friends in England.
None of them were partial to the Puritan discipline; nor did they like
Harry the worse for not being the least of a milksop. Manners, you see,
were looser a hundred years ago; tongues were vastly more free-and-easy;
names were named, and things were done, which we should screech now to
hear mentioned. Yes, madam, we are not as our ancestors were. Ought we
not to thank the Fates that have improved our morals so prodigiously,
and made us so eminently virtuous?

<p/>So, keeping a shrewd keen eye upon people round about him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), and fancying,
not incorrectly, that his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) cousins were disposed to pump him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), Harry
Warrington had thought fit to keep his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) own counsel regarding his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) own
affairs, and in all games of chance or matters of sport was quite a
match for the three gentlemen into whose company he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) had fallen. Even in
the noble game of billiards he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) could hold his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) own after a few days' play
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) cousins and their revered pastor. His (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) grandfather loved the
game, and had over from Europe one of the very few tables which existed
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) Majesty's province of Virginia. Nor, though Mr. Will could
beat him (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) at the commencement, could he (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) get undue odds out of the young
gamester. After their first bet, Harry was on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) guard with Mr. Will,
and cousin William owned, not without respect, that the American was his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>)
match in most things, and his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) better in many. But though Harry played so
well that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could beat the parson, and soon was the equal of Will, who
of course could beat both the girls, how came it, that in the contests
with these, especially with one of them, Mr. Warrington frequently
came off second? He (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) was profoundly courteous to every being who wore a
petticoat; nor has that traditional politeness yet left his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) country. All
the women of the Castlewood establishment loved the young gentleman.
The grim housekeeper was mollified by him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>): the fat cook greeted him (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>) with
blowsy smiles; the ladies'-maids, whether of the French or the English
nation, smirked and giggled in his (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>) behalf; the pretty porter's daughter
at the lodge had always a kind word in reply to his (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>). Madame de Bernstein
took note of all these things, and, though she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) said nothing, watched
carefully the boy's disposition and behaviour.

<p/>Who can say how old Lady Maria Esmond was? Books of the Peerage were
not so many in those days as they are in our blessed times, and I cannot
tell to a few years, or even a lustre or two. When Will used to say she (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>)
was five-and-thirty, he (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) was abusive, and, besides, was always given
to exaggeration. Maria was Will's half-sister. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) and my lord were
children of the late Lord Castlewood's first wife, a German lady, whom,
`tis known, my lord married in the time of Queen Anne's wars. Baron
Bernstein, who married Maria's Aunt Beatrix, Bishop Tusher's widow, was
also a German, a Hanoverian nobleman, and relative of the first Lady
Castlewood. If my Lady Maria was born under George I., and his (<font color='blue'><b>I.</b></font>) Majesty
George II. had been thirty years on the throne, how could she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) be
seven-and-twenty, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) told Harry Warrington she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) was? <div class="bookquote">``I am old,
child,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) used to say. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) used to call Harry <div class="bookquote">``child''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>when they were
alone. <div class="bookquote">``I am a hundred years old. I am seven-and-twenty. I might be your
mother almost.''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>To which Harry would reply, <div class="bookquote">``Your ladyship might be the
mother of all the cupids, I am sure. You don't look twenty, on my word
you do Dot!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div><p/>Lady Maria looked any age you liked. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) was a fair beauty with a
dazzling white and red complexion, an abundance of fair hair which
flowed over her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) shoulders, and beautiful round arms which showed to
uncommon advantage when she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) played at billiards with cousin Harry. When
she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) had to stretch across the table to make a stroke, that youth caught
glimpses of a little ankle, a little clocked stocking, and a little
black satin slipper with a little red heel, which filled him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) with
unutterable rapture, and made him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) swear that there never was such a
foot, ankle, clocked stocking, satin slipper in the world. And yet, oh,
you foolish Harry! your mother's foot was ever so much more slender, and
half an inch shorter, than Lady Maria's. But, somehow, boys do not look
at their mammas' slippers and ankles with rapture.

<p/>No doubt Lady Maria was very kind to Harry when they were alone. Before
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) sister, aunt, stepmother, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) made light of him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), calling him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) a
simpleton, a chit, and who knows what trivial names? Behind his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) back,
and even before his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) face, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) mimicked his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) accent, which smacked
somewhat of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) province. Harry blushed and corrected the faulty
intonation, under his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) English monitresses. His (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) aunt pronounced that they
would soon make him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) a pretty fellow.

<p/>Lord Castlewood, we have said, became daily more familiar and friendly
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) guest and relative. Till the crops were off the ground there
was no sporting, except an occasional cock-match at Winchester, and a
bull-baiting at Hexton Fair. Harry and Will rode off to many jolly fairs
and races round about the young Virginian was presented to some of the
county families--the Henleys of the Grange, the Crawleys of Queen's
Crawley, the Redmaynes of Lionsden, and so forth. The neighbours came
in their great heavy coaches, and passed two or three days in country
fashion. More of them would have come, but for the fear all the
Castlewood family had of offending Madame de Bernstein. She (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) did not like
country company; the rustical society and conversation annoyed her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``We
shall be merrier when my aunt leaves us,''  (<font color='red'><b>the folks</b></font>)</div>the young folks owned. <div class="bookquote">``We
have cause, as you may imagine, for being very civil to her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>). You know
what a favourite she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) was with our papa? And with reason. She (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) got him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>)
earldom, being very well indeed at Court at that time with the King and
Queen. She (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) commands here naturally, perhaps a little too much. We are
all afraid of her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>): even my elder brother stands in awe of her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>), and my
stepmother is much more obedient to her (<font color='blue'><b>stepmother</b></font>) than she (<font color='blue'><b>stepmother</b></font>) ever was to my papa,
whom she (<font color='blue'><b>stepmother</b></font>) ruled with a rod of iron. But Castlewood is merrier when our
aunt is not here. At least we have much more company. You will come to
us in our gay days, Harry, won't you? Of course you will: this is your
home, sir. I was so pleased--oh, so pleased--when my brother said he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)
considered it was your home!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>A soft hand is held out after this pretty speech, a pair of very well
preserved blue eyes look exceedingly friendly. Harry grasps his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) cousin's
hand with ardour. I do not know what privilege of cousinship he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) would
not like to claim, only he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) is so timid. They call the English selfish
and cold. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) at first thought his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) relatives were so: but how mistaken he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
was! How kind and affectionate they are, especially the Earl,--and
dear, dear Maria! How he (<font color='blue'><b>Earl</b></font>) wishes he (<font color='blue'><b>Earl</b></font>) could recall that letter which he (<font color='blue'><b>Earl</b></font>)
had written to Mrs. Mountain and his (<font color='blue'><b>Earl</b></font>) mother, in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Earl</b></font>) hinted that his (<font color='blue'><b>Earl</b></font>)
welcome had been a cold one! The Earl his (<font color='blue'><b>Earl</b></font>) cousin was everything that was
kind, had promised to introduce him (<font color='blue'><b>Earl</b></font>) to London society, and present him (<font color='blue'><b>Earl</b></font>)
at Court, and at White's. He (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>) was to consider Castlewood as his (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>) English
home. He (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>) had been most hasty in his (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>) judgment regarding his (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>) relatives
in Hampshire. All this, with many contrite expressions, he (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>) wrote in his (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>)
second despatch to Virginia. And he (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>) added, for it hath been hinted
that the young gentleman did not spell at this early time with especial
accuracy, <div class="bookquote">``My cousin, the Lady Maria, is a perfect Angle.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ille praeter omnes angulus ridet,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Dempster/Dempster</b></font>)</div>muttered little Mr. Dempster, at
home in Virginia.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The child can't be falling in love with his (<font color='blue'><b>Angle</b></font>) angle, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Angle</b></font>) calls her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>)!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>cries out Mountain.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Pooh, pooh! my niece Maria is forty!''  (<font color='red'><b>Madam Esmond/Madam Esmond Warrington/Madam Warrington</b></font>)</div>says Madam Esmond. <div class="bookquote">``I perfectly
well recollect her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) when I was at home--a great, gawky, carroty creature,
with a foot like a pair of bellows.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Where is truth, forsooth, and who
knoweth it? Is Beauty beautiful, or is it only our eyes that make it
so? Does Venus squint? Has she (<font color='blue'><b>Venus</b></font>) got a splay-foot, red hair, and a crooked
back? Anoint my eyes, good Fairy Puck, so that I may ever consider the
Beloved Object a paragon! Above all, keep on anointing my mistress's
dainty peepers with the very strongest ointment, so that my noddle may
ever appear lovely to her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>), and that she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) may continue to crown my honest
ears with fresh roses!

<p/>Now, not only was Harry Warrington a favourite with some in the
drawing-room, and all the ladies of the servants'-hall, but, like master
like man, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) valet Gumbo was very much admired and respected by very
many of the domestic circle. Gumbo had a hundred accomplishments. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
was famous as a fisherman, huntsman, blacksmith. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could dress hair
beautifully, and improved himself in the art under my lord's own Swiss
gentleman. He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was great at cooking many of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) Virginian dishes, and
learned many new culinary secrets from my lord's French man. We have
heard how exquisitely and melodiously he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sang at church; and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sang not
only sacred but secular music, often inventing airs and composing rude
words after the habit of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) people. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) played the fiddle so charmingly,
that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) set all the girls dancing in Castlewood Hall, and was ever
welcome to a gratis mug of ale at the Three Castles in the village, if
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would but bring his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fiddle with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was good-natured and loved
to play for the village children: so that Mr. Warrington's negro was a
universal favourite in all the Castlewood domain.

<p/>Now it was not difficult for the servants'-hall folks to perceive that
Mr. Gumbo was a liar, which fact was undoubted in spite of all his (<font color='blue'><b>Gumbo</b></font>) good
qualities. For instance, that day at church, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Gumbo</b></font>) pretended to read
out of Molly's psalm-book, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gumbo</b></font>) sang quite other words than those which
were down in the book, of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Gumbo</b></font>) could not decipher a syllable. And
he (<font color='blue'><b>Gumbo</b></font>) pretended to understand music, whereupon the Swiss valet brought him (<font color='blue'><b>valet</b></font>)
some, and Master Gumbo turned the page upside down. These instances of
long-bow practice daily occurred, and were patent to all the Castlewood
household. They knew Gumbo was a liar, perhaps not thinking the worse
of him (<font color='blue'><b>liar</b></font>) for this weakness; but they did not know how great a liar he (<font color='blue'><b>liar</b></font>)
was, and believed him (<font color='blue'><b>liar</b></font>) much more than they had any reason for doing, and
because, I suppose, they liked to believe him (<font color='blue'><b>liar</b></font>).

<p/>Whatever might be his (<font color='blue'><b>liar</b></font>) feelings of wonder and envy on first viewing the
splendour and comforts of Castlewood, Mr. Gumbo kept his (<font color='blue'><b>Gumbo</b></font>) sentiments
to himself, and examined the place, park, appointments, stables, very
coolly. The horses, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gumbo</b></font>) said, were very well, what there were of them;
but at Castlewood in Virginia they had six times as many, and let
me see, fourteen eighteen grooms to look after them. Madam Esmond's
carriages were much finer than my lord's,--great deal more gold on the
panels. As for her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) gardens, they covered acres, and they grew every kind
of flower and fruit under the sun. Pineapples and peaches? Pineapples
and peaches were so common, they were given to pigs in his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) country. They
had twenty forty gardeners, not white gardeners, all black gentlemen,
like hisself. In the house were twenty forty gentlemen in
livery, besides women-servants--never could remember how
many women-servants,--dere were so many: tink dere were fifty
women-servants--all Madam Esmond's property, and worth ever so many
hundred pieces of eight apiece. How much was a piece of eight? Bigger
than a guinea, a piece of eight was. Tink, Madam Esmond have twenty
thirty thousand guineas a year,--have whole rooms full of gold and
plate. Came to England in one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) ships; have ever so many ships,
Gumbo can't count how many ships; and estates, covered all over with
tobacco and negroes, and reaching out for a week's journey. Was Master
Harry heir to all this property? Of course, now Master George was killed
and scalped by the Indians. Gumbo had killed ever so many Indians, and
tried to save Master George, but he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) was Master Harry's boy,--and Master
Harry was as rich,--oh, as rich as ever he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) like. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wore black now,
because Master George was dead; but you should see his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) chests full of
gold clothes, and lace, and jewels at Bristol. Of course, Master
Harry was the richest man in all Virginia, and might have twenty sixty
servants; only he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) liked travelling with one best, and that one, it need
scarcely be said, was Gumbo.

<p/>This story was not invented at once, but gradually elicited from Mr.
Gumbo, who might have uttered some trifling contradictions during the
progress of the narrative, but by the time he (<font color='blue'><b>Gumbo</b></font>) had told his (<font color='blue'><b>Gumbo</b></font>) tale twice or
thrice in the servants'-hall or the butler's private apartment, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gumbo</b></font>)
was pretty perfect and consistent in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gumbo</b></font>) part, and knew accurately the
number of slaves Madam Esmond kept, and the amount of income which she (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>)
enjoyed. The truth is, that as four or five blacks are required to do
the work of one white man, the domestics in American establishments
are much more numerous than in ours; and, like the houses of most other
Virginian landed proprietors, Madam Esmond's mansion and stables swarmed
with negroes.

<p/>Mr. Gumbo's account of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gumbo</b></font>) mistress's wealth and splendour was carried
to my lord by his (<font color='blue'><b>Gumbo</b></font>) lordship's man, and to Madame de Bernstein and my
ladies by their respective waiting-women, and, we may be sure, lost
nothing in the telling. A young gentleman in England is not the
less liked because he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) is reputed to be the heir to vast wealth and
possessions; when Lady Castlewood came to hear of Harry's prodigious
expectations, she (<font color='blue'><b>Castlewood</b></font>) repented of her (<font color='blue'><b>Castlewood</b></font>) first cool reception of him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), and of
having pinched her (<font color='blue'><b>Castlewood</b></font>) daughter's arm till it was black-and-blue for having
been extended towards the youth in too friendly a manner. Was it too
late to have him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) back into those fair arms? Lady Fanny was welcome to
try, and resumed the dancing-lessons. The Countess would play the music
with all her (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) heart. But, how provoking! that odious, sentimental Maria
would always insist upon being in the room; and, as sure as Fanny walked
in the gardens or the park, so sure would her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) sister come trailing after
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>). As for Madame de Bernstein, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) laughed, and was amused at the
stories of the prodigious fortune of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) Virginian relatives. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) knew
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) half-sister's man of business in London, and very likely was aware
of the real state of Madame Esmond's money matters; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) did not
contradict the rumours which Gumbo and his (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) fellow-servants had set
afloat; and was not a little diverted by the effect which these reports
had upon the behaviour of the Castlewood family towards their young
kinsman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hang him (<font color='blue'><b>Angle</b></font>)! Is he (<font color='blue'><b>Angle</b></font>) so rich, Molly?''  (<font color='red'><b>lord</b></font>)</div>said my lord to his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) elder sister.
<div class="bookquote">``Then good-bye to our chances with your aunt. The Baroness will be sure
to leave him (<font color='blue'><b>Angle</b></font>) all her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) money to spite us, and because he (<font color='blue'><b>Angle</b></font>) doesn't want
it. Nevertheless, the lad is a good lad enough, and it is not his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) fault
being rich, you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) is very simple and modest in his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) habits for one so wealthy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maria/Lady Maria/Lady Maria Esmond</b></font>)</div>remarks
Maria.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Rich people often are so,''  (<font color='red'><b>lord</b></font>)</div>says my lord. <div class="bookquote">``If I were rich, I often think
I would be the greatest miser, and live in rags and on a crust. Depend
on it there is no pleasure so enduring as money-getting. It grows on
you, and increases with old age. But because I am as poor as Lazarus, I
dress in purple and fine linen, and fare sumptuously every day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maria/Lady Maria/Lady Maria Esmond</b></font>)</div><p/>Maria went to the book-room and got the History of Virginia, by R. B.
Gent--and read therein what an admirable climate it was, and how all
kinds of fruit and corn grew in that province, and what noble rivers
were those of Potomac and Rappahannoc, abounding in all sorts of fish.
And she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) wondered whether the climate would agree with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>), and whether
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) aunt would like her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>)? And Harry was sure his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) mother would adore
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), so would Mountain. And when he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was asked about the number of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
mother's servants, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said, they certainly had more servants than are
seen in England--he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) did not know how many. But the negroes did not do
near as much work as English servants did hence the necessity of keeping
so great a number. As for some others of Gumbo's details which were
brought to him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) laughed and said the boy was wonderful as a romancer,
and in telling such stories he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) supposed was trying to speak out for the
honour of the family.

<p/>So Harry was modest as well as rich! His (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) denials only served to confirm
his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) relatives' opinion regarding his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) splendid expectations. More and
more the Countess and the ladies were friendly and affectionate with
him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). More and more Mr. Will betted with him (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>), and wanted to sell him (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>)
bargains. Harry's simple dress and equipage only served to confirm his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
friends' idea of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wealth. To see a young man of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) rank and means
with but one servant, and without horses or a carriage of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) own--what
modesty! When he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) went to London he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) would cut a better figure? Of course
he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) would. Castlewood would introduce him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) to the best society in the
capital, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) would appear as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) ought to appear at St. James's. No
man could be more pleasant, wicked, lively, obsequious than the worthy
chaplain, Mr. Sampson. How proud he (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) would be if he (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) could show his (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) young
friend a little of London life!--if he (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) could warn rogues off him (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>), and
keep him (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) out of the way of harm! Mr. Sampson was very kind: everybody
was very kind. Harry liked quite well the respect that was paid to him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>).
As Madam Esmond's son he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) thought perhaps it was his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) due: and took for
granted that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was the personage which his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) family imagined him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) to be.
How should he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) know better, who had never as yet seen any place but his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
own province, and why should he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) not respect his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) own condition when other
people respected it so? So all the little knot of people at Castlewood
House, and from these the people in Castlewood village, and from thence
the people in the whole county, chose to imagine that Mr. Harry Esmond
Warrington was the heir of immense wealth, and a gentleman of very
great importance, because his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) negro valet told lies about him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) in the
servants'-hall.

<p/>Harry's aunt, Madame de Bernstein, after a week or two, began to tire of
Castlewood and the inhabitants of that mansion, and the neighbours who
came to visit them. This clever woman tired of most things and people
sooner or later. So she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) took to nodding and sleeping over the chaplain's
stories, and to doze at her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) whist and over her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) dinner, and to be very
snappish and sarcastic in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) conversation with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) Esmond nephews and
nieces, hitting out blows at my lord and his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) brother the jockey, and my
ladies, widowed and unmarried, who winced under her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) scornful remarks,
and bore them as they best might. The cook, whom she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had so praised on
first coming, now gave her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) no satisfaction; the wine was corked; the
house was damp, dreary, and full of draughts; the doors would not shut,
and the chimneys were smoky. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) began to think the Tunbridge waters
were very necessary for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), and ordered the doctor, who came to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
from the neighbouring town of Hexton, to order those waters for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
benefit.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish to heaven she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) would go!''  (<font color='red'><b>lord member</b></font>)</div>growled my lord, who was the most
independent member of his (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) family. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) may go to Tunbridge, or she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) may
go to Bath, or she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) may go to Jericho, for me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Shall Fanny and I come with you to Tunbridge, dear Baroness?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady</b></font>)</div>asked
Lady Castlewood of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) sister-in-law.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not for worlds, my dear! The doctor orders me absolute quiet, and if
you came I should have the knocker going all day, and Fanny's lovers
would never be out of the house,''  (<font color='red'><b>Baroness/Baroness Bernstein/Bernstein</b></font>)</div>answered the Baroness, who was quite
weary of Lady Castlewood's company.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish I could be of any service to my aunt!''  (<font color='red'><b>Maria/Lady Maria/Lady Maria Esmond</b></font>)</div>said the sentimental Lady
Maria, demurely.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My good child, what can you do for me? You cannot play piquet so well
as my maid, and I have heard all your songs till I am perfectly tired of
them! One of the gentlemen might go with me: at least make the journey,
and see me safe from highwaymen.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm sure, ma’am, I shall be glad to ride with you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Will/Will/Will Esmond</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Will.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, not you! I don't want you, William,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>cried the young man's
aunt. <div class="bookquote">``Why do not you offer, and where are your American manners, you
ungracious Harry Warrington? Don't swear, Will, Harry is much better
company than you are, and much better ton too, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Tong, indeed! Confound his (<font color='blue'><b>Tong</b></font>) tong,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>growled envious Will to himself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I dare say I shall be tired of him (<font color='blue'><b>Tong</b></font>), as I am of other folks,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Baroness</b></font>)</div>continued
the Baroness. <div class="bookquote">``I have scarcely seen Harry at all in these last days. You
shall ride with me to Tunbridge, Harry!''

 (<font color='red'><b>aunt</b></font>)</div><p/>At this direct appeal, and to no one's wonder more than that of his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>)
aunt, Mr. Harry Warrington blushed, and hemmed and ha'd and at length
said, <div class="bookquote">``I have promised my cousin Castlewood to go over to Hexton Petty
Sessions with him (<font color='blue'><b>Petty</b></font>) to-morrow. He (<font color='blue'><b>Petty</b></font>) thinks I should see how the Courts here
are conducted--and--and--the partridge-shooting will soon begin, and
I have promised to be here for that, ma’am.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Harry/Mr. Harry Warrington</b></font>)</div>Saying which words, Harry
Warrington looked as red as a poppy, whilst Lady Maria held her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) meek
face downwards, and nimbly plied her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) needle.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You actually refuse to go with me to Tunbridge Wells?''  (<font color='red'><b>Bernstein/Madame de Bernstein/Madame Bernstein</b></font>)</div>called out
Madame Bernstein, her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) eyes lightening, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) face flushing up with
anger, too.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not to ride with you, ma’am; that I will do with all my heart; but to
stay there--I have promised...''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Enough, enough, sir! I can go alone, and don't want your escort,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>cried
the irate old lady, and rustled out of the room.

<p/>The Castlewood family looked at each other with wonder. Will whistled.
Lady Castlewood glanced at Fanny, as much as to say, His (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>) chance is over.
Lady Maria never lifted up her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) eyes from her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) tambour-frame.




<p/>CHAPTER XVII. On the Scent


<p/>Young Harry Warrington's act of revolt came so suddenly upon Madame
de Bernstein, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) had no other way of replying to it, than by the
prompt outbreak of anger with which we left her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) in the last chapter. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>)
darted two fierce glances at Lady Fanny and her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) mother as she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) quitted
the room. Lady Maria over her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) tambour-frame escaped without the least
notice, and scarcely lifted up her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) head from her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) embroidery, to watch
the aunt retreating, or the looks which mamma-in-law and sister threw at
one another.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So, in spite of all, you have, madam?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>the maternal looks seemed to
say.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have what?''  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Lady Fanny</b></font>)</div>asked Lady Fanny's eyes. But what good in looking innocent?
She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) looked puzzled. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) did not look one-tenth part as innocent as
Maria. Had she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) been guilty, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) would have looked not guilty much more
cleverly; and would have taken care to study and compose a face so as to
be ready to suit the plea. Whatever was the expression of Fanny's eyes,
mamma glared on her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) would have liked to tear them out.

<p/>But Lady Castlewood could not operate upon the said eyes then and there,
like the barbarous monsters in the stage-direction in King Lear. When
her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) ladyship was going to tear out her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) daughter's eyes, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) would retire
smiling, with an arm round her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) dear child's waist, and then gouge her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) in
private.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So you don't fancy going with the old lady to Tunbridge Wells?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>was
all she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) said to Cousin Warrington, wearing at the same time a perfectly
well-bred simper on her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And small blame to our cousin!''  (<font color='red'><b>lord</b></font>)</div>interposed my lord. -LRB-The face over the
tambour-frame looked up for one instant.-RRB- <div class="bookquote">``A young fellow must not have
it all idling and holiday. Let him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) mix up something useful with his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)
pleasures, and go to the fiddles and pump-rooms at Tunbridge or the Bath
later. Mr. Warrington has to conduct a great estate in America: let him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>)
see how ours in England are carried on. Will hath shown him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) the kennel
and the stables; and the games in vogue, which I think, cousin, you
seem to play as well as your teachers. After harvest we will show him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>)
a little English fowling and shooting: in winter we will take him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>)
out a-hunting. Though there has been a coolness between us and our
aunt-kinswoman in Virginia, yet we are of the same blood. Ere we
send our cousin back to his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) mother, let us show him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) what an English
gentleman's life at home is. I should like to read with him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) as well as
sport with him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>), and that is why I have been pressing him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) of late to stay
and bear me company.''

 (<font color='red'><b>lord</b></font>)</div><p/>My lord spoke with such perfect frankness that his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) mother-in-law and
half-brother and sister could not help wondering what his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) meaning
could be. The three last-named persons often held little conspiracies
together, and caballed or grumbled against the head of the house. When
he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) adopted that frank tone, there was no fathoming his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) meaning: often it
would not be discovered until months had passed. He (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) did not say, <div class="bookquote">``This
is true,''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>but, <div class="bookquote">``I mean that this statement should be accepted and
believed in my family.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>It was then a thing convenue, that my Lord
Castlewood had a laudable desire to cultivate the domestic affections,
and to educate, amuse, and improve his (<font color='blue'><b>Castlewood</b></font>) young relative; and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Castlewood</b></font>) had
taken a great fancy to the lad, and wished that Harry should stay for
some time near his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) lordship.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is Castlewood's game now?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. William/William/William Esmond</b></font>)</div>asked William of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) mother and sister
as they disappeared into the corridors. <div class="bookquote">``Stop! By George, I have it!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What, William?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) intends to get him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) to play, and to win the Virginia estate back from
him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>). That's what it is!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But the lad has not got the Virginia estate to pay, if he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) loses,''
 (<font color='red'><b>mamma</b></font>)</div>remarks mamma.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If my brother has not some scheme in view, may I be--.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hush! Of course he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) has a scheme in view. But what is it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) can't mean Maria--Maria is as old as Harry's mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maria muses William</b></font>)</div>muses Mr.
William.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Pooh! with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) old face and sandy hair and freckled skin! Impossible!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Lady Fanny</b></font>)</div>cries Lady Fanny, with somewhat of a sigh.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course, your ladyship had a fancy for the Iroquois, too!''  (<font color='red'><b>mamma</b></font>)</div>cried
mamma.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I trust I know my station and duty better, madam! If I had liked him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>),
that is no reason why I should marry him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). Your ladyship hath taught me
as much as that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My Lady Fanny!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sure you married our papa without liking him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>). You have told me so
a thousand times!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And if you did not love our father before marriage, you certainly did
not fall in love with him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) afterwards,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. William/William/William Esmond</b></font>)</div>broke in Mr. William, with a
laugh. <div class="bookquote">``Fan and I remember how our honoured parents used to fight. Don't
us, Fan? And our brother Esmond kept the peace.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't recall those dreadful low scenes, William!''  (<font color='red'><b>mamma</b></font>)</div>cries mamma. <div class="bookquote">``When
your father took too much drink, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was like a madman; and his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) conduct
should be a warning to you, sir, who are fond of the same horrid
practice.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sure, madam, you were not much the happier for marrying the man
you did not like, and your ladyship's title hath brought very little
along with it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Lady Fanny</b></font>)</div>whimpered out Lady Fanny. <div class="bookquote">``What is the use of a coronet
with the jointure of a tradesman's wife?--how many of them are richer
than we are? There is come lately to live in our Square, at Kensington,
a grocer's widow from London Bridge, whose daughters have three gowns
where I have one; and who, though they are waited on but by a man and a
couple of maids, I know eat and drink a thousand times better than we
do with our scraps of cold meat on our plate, and our great flaunting,
trapesing, impudent, lazy lacqueys!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)! he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)! glad I dine at the palace, and not at home!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Will/Will/Will Esmond</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Will.
-LRB-Mr. Will, through his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) aunt's interest with Count Puffendorff, Groom
of the Royal -LCB-and Serene Electoral-RCB- Powder-Closet, had one of the many
small places at Court, that of Deputy Powder.-RRB-

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why should I not be happy without any title except my own?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady</b></font>)</div>continued
Lady Frances. <div class="bookquote">``Many people are. I dare say they are even happy in
America.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes!--with a mother-in-law who is a perfect Turk and Tartar, for all I
hear--with Indian war-whoops howling all around you and with a danger
of losing your scalp, or of being eat up by a wild beast every time you
went to church.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wouldn't go to church,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Lady Fanny</b></font>)</div>said Lady Fanny.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You'd go with anybody who asked you, Fan!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Will/Will/Will Esmond</b></font>)</div>roared out Mr. Will: <div class="bookquote">``and
so would old Maria, and so would any woman, that's the fact.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Will/Will/Will Esmond</b></font>)</div>And Will
laughed at his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) own wit.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Pray, good folks, what is all your merriment about?''  (<font color='red'><b>Bernstein/Madame de Bernstein/Madame Bernstein</b></font>)</div>here asked Madame
Bernstein, peeping in on her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) relatives from the tapestried door which
led into the gallery where their conversation was held.

<p/>Will told her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) that his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) mother and sister had been having a fight -LRB-which
was not a novelty, as Madame Bernstein knew-RRB-, because Fanny wanted to
marry their cousin, the wild Indian, and my lady Countess would not let
her (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>). Fanny protested against this statement. Since the very first day
when her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) mother had told her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) not to speak to the young gentleman, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
had scarcely exchanged two words with him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) knew her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) station better.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) did not want to be scalped by wild Indians, or eat up by bears.

<p/>Madame de Bernstein looked puzzled. <div class="bookquote">``If he (<font color='blue'><b>Fan</b></font>) is not staying for you, for
whom is he (<font color='blue'><b>Fan</b></font>) staying?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>) asked. <div class="bookquote">``At the houses to which he (<font color='blue'><b>Fan</b></font>) has been
carried, you have taken care not to show him (<font color='blue'><b>Fan</b></font>) a woman that is not a
fright or in the nursery; and I think the boy is too proud to fall in
love with a dairymaid, Will.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Humph! That is a matter of taste, ma’am,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. William/William/William Esmond</b></font>)</div>says Mr. William, with a
shrug of his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) shoulders.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of Mr. William Esmond's taste, as you say; but not of yonder boy's. The
Esmonds of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) grandfather's nurture, sir, would not go a-courting in
the kitchen.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, ma’am, every man to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) taste, I say again. A fellow might go
farther and fare worse than my brother's servants'-hall, and besides
Fan, there's only the maids or old Maria to choose from.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Maria! Impossible!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And yet, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>) spoke the very words, a sudden
thought crossed Madame Bernstein's mind, that this elderly Calypso might
have captivated her (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>) young Telemachus. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>) called to mind half a dozen
instances in her (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>) own experience of young men who had been infatuated by
old women. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>) remembered how frequent Harry Warrington's absences
had been of late--absences which she (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>) attributed to his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) love for field
sports. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>) remembered how often, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) was absent, Maria Esmond
was away too. Walks in cool avenues, whisperings in garden temples, or
behind clipt hedges, casual squeezes of the hand in twilight corridors,
or sweet glances and ogles in meetings on the stairs,--a lively fancy,
an intimate knowledge of the world, very likely a considerable personal
experience in early days, suggested all these possibilities and
chances to Madame de Bernstein, just as she (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) was saying that they were
impossible.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Impossible, ma’am! I don't know,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Will continued. <div class="bookquote">``My mother warned Fan
off him (<font color='blue'><b>Fan</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, your mother did warn Fanny off?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly, my dear Baroness!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Didn't she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>)? Didn't she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) pinch Fanny's arm black-and-blue? Didn't they
fight about it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nonsense, William! For shame, William!''  (<font color='red'><b>cry the ladies</b></font>)</div>cry both the implicated ladies
in a breath.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And now, since we have heard how rich he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) is, perhaps it is sour grapes,
that is all. And now, since he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) is warned off the young bird, perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>)
is hunting the old one, that's all. Impossible why impossible? You know
old Lady Suffolk, ma’am?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``William, how can you speak about Lady Suffolk to your aunt?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div><p/>A grin passed over the countenance of the young gentleman. <div class="bookquote">``Because
Lady Suffolk was a special favourite at Court? Well, other folks have
succeeded her (<font color='blue'><b>Suffolk</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sir!''  (<font color='red'><b>Bernstein/Madame de Bernstein/Madame Bernstein</b></font>)</div>cries Madame de Bernstein, who may have had her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) reasons to take
offence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So they have, I say; or who, pray, is my Lady Yarmouth now? And didn't
old Lady Suffolk go and fall in love with George Berkeley, and marry him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
when she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) was ever so old? Nay, ma’am, if I remember right--and we hear
a deal of town-talk at our table--Harry Estridge went mad about your
ladyship when you were somewhat rising twenty; and would have changed
your name a third time if you would but have let him (<font color='blue'><b>Estridge</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Bernstein/Madame de Bernstein/Madame Bernstein</b></font>)</div><p/>This allusion to an adventure of her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) own later days, which was, indeed,
pretty notorious to all the world, did not anger Madame de Bernstein,
like Will's former hint about his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) aunt having been a favourite at George
the Second's Court; but, on the contrary, set her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) in good-humour.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Au fait,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) said, musing, as she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) played a pretty little hand on the
table, and no doubt thinking about mad young Harry Estridge; `tis not
impossible, William, that old folks, and young folks, too, should play
the fool.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But I can't understand a young fellow being in love with Maria,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. William/William/William Esmond</b></font>)</div>continued Mr. William, <div class="bookquote">``however he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) might be with you, ma’am. That's oter
shose, as our French tutor used to say. You remember the Count, ma’am;
he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)! he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)!--and so does Maria!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. William/William/William Esmond</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``William!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And I dare say the Count remembers the bastinado Castlewood had given
to him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>). A confounded French dancing-master calling himself a count, and
daring to fall in love in our family! Whenever I want to make myself
uncommonly agreeable to old Maria, I just say a few words of parly voo
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) knows what I mean.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you abused her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) to your cousin, Harry Warrington?''  (<font color='red'><b>Bernstein/Madame de Bernstein/Madame Bernstein</b></font>)</div>asked Madame de

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well--I know she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) is always abusing me--and I have said my mind about
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Will/Will/Will Esmond</b></font>)</div>said Will.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, you idiot!''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>cried the old lady. <div class="bookquote">``Who but a gaby ever spoke ill of a
woman to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) sweetheart? He (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) will tell her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) everything, and they both will
hate you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The very thing, ma’am!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>cried Will, bursting into a great laugh. <div class="bookquote">``I
had a sort of a suspicion, you see, and two days ago, as we were riding
together, I told Harry Warrington a bit of my mind about Maria;--why
shouldn't I, I say? She (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) is always abusing me, ain't she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>), Fan? And your
favourite turned as red as my plush waistcoat--wondered how a gentleman
could malign his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) own flesh and blood, and, trembling all over with rage,
said I was no true Esmond.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why didn't you chastise him (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>), sir, as my lord did the dancing-master?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Lady</b></font>)</div>cried Lady Castlewood.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, mother,--you see that at quarter-staff there's two sticks used,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. William/William/William Esmond</b></font>)</div>replied Mr. William; <div class="bookquote">``and my opinion is, that Harry Warrington can guard
his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) own head uncommonly well. Perhaps that is one of the reasons why I
did not offer to treat my cousin to a caning. And now you say so, ma’am,
I know he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) has told Maria. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) has been looking battle, murder, and
sudden death at me ever since. All which shows--''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. William/William/William Esmond</b></font>)</div>and here he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) turned
to his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) aunt.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``All which shows what?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That I think we are on the right scent; and that we've found Maria--the
old fox!''  (<font color='red'><b>the youth</b></font>)</div>And the ingenuous youth here clapped his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) hand to his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) mouth,
and gave a loud halloo.

<p/>How far had this pretty intrigue gone? now was the question. Mr. Will
said, that at her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) age, Maria would be for conducting matters as rapidly
as possible, not having much time to lose. There was not a great deal of
love lost between Will and his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) half-sister.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who would sift the matter to the bottom? Scolding one party or the
other was of no avail. Threats only serve to aggravate people in such
cases. I never was in danger but once, young people,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bernstein/Madame de Bernstein/Madame Bernstein</b></font>)</div>said Madame de
Bernstein, <div class="bookquote">``and I think that was because my poor mother contradicted me.
If this boy is like others of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) family, the more we oppose him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), the
more entete he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) will be; and we shall never get him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) out of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) scrape.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Bernstein/Madame de Bernstein/Madame Bernstein</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Faith, ma’am, suppose we leave him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) in it?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>grumbled Will. <div class="bookquote">``Old Maria
and I don't love each other too much, I grant you; but an English earl's
daughter is good enough for an American tobacco-planter, when all is
said and done.''

 (<font color='red'><b>mother sister</b></font>)</div><p/>Here his (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>) mother and sister broke out. They would not hear of such a
union. To which Will answered, <div class="bookquote">``You are like the dog in the manger. You
don't want the man yourself, Fanny''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I want him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), indeed!''  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Lady Fanny</b></font>)</div>cries Lady Fanny, with a toss of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) head.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then why grudge him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to Maria? I think Castlewood wants her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) to have
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why grudge him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to Maria, sir?''  (<font color='red'><b>Bernstein/Madame de Bernstein/Madame Bernstein</b></font>)</div>cried Madame de Bernstein, with great
energy. <div class="bookquote">``Do you remember who the poor boy is, and what your house owes
to his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) family? His (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) grandfather was the best friend your father ever had,
and gave up this estate, this title, this very castle, in which you
are conspiring against the friendless Virginian lad, that you and yours
might profit by it. And the reward for all this kindness is, that you
all but shut the door on the child when he (<font color='blue'><b>Virginian</b></font>) knocks at it, and talk of
marrying him (<font color='blue'><b>Virginian</b></font>) to a silly elderly creature who might be his (<font color='blue'><b>Virginian</b></font>) mother! He (<font color='blue'><b>Virginian</b></font>)
shan't marry her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The very thing we were saying and thinking, my dear Baroness!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Lady</b></font>)</div>interposes Lady Castlewood. <div class="bookquote">``Our part of the family is not eager about
the match, though my lord and Maria may be.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You would like him (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) for yourself, now that you hear he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) is rich--and may
be richer, young people, mind you that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madam Beatrix/Beatrix</b></font>)</div>cried Madam Beatrix, turning
upon the other women.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Warrington may be ever so rich, madam, but there is no need why
your ladyship should perpetually remind us that we are poor,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady</b></font>)</div>broke
in Lady Castlewood, with some spirit. <div class="bookquote">``At least there is very little
disparity in Fanny's age and Mr. Harry's; and you surely will be the
last to say that a lady of our name and family is not good enough for
any gentleman born in Virginia or elsewhere.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Let Fanny take an English gentleman, Countess, not an American. With
such a name and such a mother to help her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), and with all her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) good looks
and accomplishments, sure, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) can't fail of finding a man worthy of
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). But from what I know about the daughters of this house, and what I
imagine about our young cousin, I am certain that no happy match could
be made between them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What does my aunt know about me?''  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Lady Fanny</b></font>)</div>asked Lady Fanny, turning very red.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Only your temper, my dear. You don't suppose that I believe all the
tittle-tattle and scandal which one cannot help hearing in town? But
the temper and early education are sufficient. Only fancy one of you
condemned to leave St. James's and the Mall, and live in a plantation
surrounded by savages! You would die of ennui, or worry your husband's
life out with your ill-humour. You are born, ladies, to ornament
courts--not wigwams. Let this lad go back to his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) wilderness with a wife
who is suited to him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>The ladies</b></font>)</div><p/>The other two ladies declared in a breath that, for their parts, they
desired no better, and, after a few more words, went on their way, while
Madame de Bernstein, lifting up her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) tapestried door, retired into her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
own chamber. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) saw all the scheme now; she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) admired the ways of women,
calling a score of little circumstances back to mind. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) wondered at
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) own blindness during the last few days, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) should not have
perceived the rise and progress of this queer little intrigue. How far
had it gone? was now the question. Was Harry's passion of the serious
and tragical sort, or a mere fire of straw which a day or two would burn
out? How deeply was he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) committed? She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) dreaded the strength of Harry's
passion, and the weakness of Maria's. A woman of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) age is so
desperate, Madame Bernstein may have thought, that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) will make any
efforts to secure a lover. Scandal, bah! She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) will retire and be a
princess in Virginia, and leave the folks in England to talk as much
scandal as they choose.

<p/>Is there always, then, one thing which women do not tell to one another,
and about which they agree to deceive each other? Does the concealment
arise from deceit or modesty? A man, as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) feels an inclination
for one of the other sex, seeks for a friend of his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) own to whom he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) may
impart the delightful intelligence. A woman -LRB-with more or less skill-RRB-
buries her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) secret away from her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) kind. For days and weeks past, had not
this old Maria made fools of the whole house,--Maria, the butt of the
family?

<p/>I forbear to go into too curious inquiries regarding the Lady Maria's
antecedents. I have my own opinion about Madame Bernstein's. A hundred
years ago people of the great world were not so straitlaced as they
are now, when everybody is good, pure, moral, modest; when there is no
skeleton in anybody's closet; when there is no scheming; no slurring
over old stories; when no girl tries to sell herself for wealth, and no
mother abets her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). Suppose my Lady Maria tries to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) little game,
wherein is her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) ladyship's great eccentricity?

<p/>On these points no doubt the Baroness de Bernstein thought, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>)
communed with herself in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) private apartment.




<p/>CHAPTER XVIII. An Old Story


<p/>As my Lady Castlewood and her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) son and daughter passed through one
door of the saloon where they had all been seated, my Lord Castlewood
departed by another issue; and then the demure eyes looked up from the
tambour-frame on which they had persisted hitherto in examining the
innocent violets and jonquils. The eyes looked up at Harry Warrington,
who stood at an ancestral portrait under the great fireplace. He (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) had
gathered a great heap of blushes -LRB-those flowers which bloom so rarely
after gentlefolks' springtime-RRB-, and with them ornamented his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) honest
countenance, his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) cheeks, his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) forehead, nay, his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) youthful ears.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why did you refuse to go with our aunt, cousin?''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>asked the lady of the
tambour frame.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Because your ladyship bade me stay,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lad</b></font>)</div>answered the lad.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I bid you stay! La! child! What one says in fun, you take in earnest!
Are all you Virginian gentlemen so obsequious as to fancy every idle
word a lady says is a command? Virginia must be a pleasant country for
our sex if it be so!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You said--when--when we walked in the terrace two nights since,--O
heaven!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>cried Harry, with a voice trembling with emotion.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, that sweet night, cousin!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>cries the Tambour-frame.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Whe--whe--when you gave me this rose from your own neck,'' (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>--roared
out Harry, pulling suddenly a crumpled and decayed vegetable from his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
waistcoat--<div class="bookquote">``which I will never part with--with, no, by heavens, whilst
this heart continues to beat! You said, `Harry, if your aunt asks you
to go away, you will go, and if you go, you will forget me.'--Didn't you
say so?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``All men forget!''  (<font color='red'><b>the Virgin</b></font>)</div>said the Virgin, with a sigh.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``In this cold selfish country they may, cousin, not in ours,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>continues
Harry, yet in the same state of exaltation--<div class="bookquote">``I had rather have lost an
arm almost than refused the old lady. I tell you it went to my heart
to say no to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) so kind to me, and who had been the means of
introducing me to--to--O heaven!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div><p/>-LRB-Here a kick to an intervening spaniel, which flies yelping from before
the fire, and a rapid advance on the tambour-frame.-RRB- <div class="bookquote">``Look here, cousin!
If you were to bid me jump out of yonder window, I should do it; or
murder, I should do it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``La! but you need not squeeze one's hand so, you silly child!''  (<font color='red'><b>Maria/Lady Maria/Lady Maria Esmond</b></font>)</div>remarks
Maria.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't help it--we are so in the south. Where my heart is, I can't
help speaking my mind out, cousin--and you know where that heart is!
Ever since that evening--that--O heaven! I tell you I have hardly slept
since--I want to do something--to distinguish myself--to be ever so
great. I wish there was giants, Maria, as I have read of in--in books,
that I could go and fight `em. I wish you was in distress, that I might
help you, somehow. I wish you wanted my blood, that I might spend
every drop of it for you. And when you told me not to go with Madame
Bernstein...''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I tell thee, child? never.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought you told me. You said you knew I preferred my aunt to my
cousin, and I said then what I say now, `Incomparable Maria! I prefer
thee to all the women in the world and all the angels in Paradise--and
I would go anywhere, were it to dungeons, if you ordered me!' And do you
think I would not stay anywhere, when you only desired that I should be
near you?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) added, after a moment's pause.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Men always talk in that way--that is,--that is, I have heard so,''  (<font color='red'><b>the spinster</b></font>)</div>said
the spinster, correcting herself; <div class="bookquote">``for what should a country-bred woman
know about you creatures? When you are near us, they say you are all
raptures and flames and promises and I don't know what; when you are
away, you forget all about us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the spinster</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I think I never want to go away as long as I live,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>groaned out
the young man. <div class="bookquote">``I have tired of many things; not books and that, I never
cared for study much, but games and sports which I used to be fond
of when I was a boy. Before I saw you, it was to be a soldier I most
desired; I tore my hair with rage when my poor dear brother went away
instead of me on that expedition in which we lost him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>). But now, I only
care for one thing in the world, and you know what that is.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You silly child! don't you know I am almost old enough to be...?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know--I know! but what is that to me? Hasn't your br...--well, never
mind who, some of `em-told me stories against you, and didn't they show
me the Family Bible, where all your names are down, and the dates of
your birth?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The cowards! Who did that?''  (<font color='red'><b>Maria/Lady Maria/Lady Maria Esmond</b></font>)</div>cried out Lady Maria. <div class="bookquote">``Dear Harry, tell me
who did that? Was it my mother-in-law, the grasping, odious, abandoned,
brazen harpy? Do you know all about her (<font color='blue'><b>mother-in-law</b></font>)? How she (<font color='blue'><b>mother-in-law</b></font>) married my father in
his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) cups--the horrid hussey!--and...''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed it wasn't Lady Castlewood,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>interposed the wondering Harry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then it was my aunt,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>continued the infuriate lady. <div class="bookquote">``A pretty moralist,
indeed! A bishop's widow, forsooth, and I should like to know whose
widow before and afterwards. Why, Harry, she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) intrigue: with the
Pretender, and with the Court of Hanover, and, I dare say, would with
the Court of Rome and the Sultan of Turkey if she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) had had the means. Do
you know who her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) second husband was? A creature who...''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But our aunt never spoke a word against you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>broke in Harry, more and
more amazed at the nymph's vehemence.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) checked her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) anger. In the inquisitive countenance opposite to
her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) thought she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) read some alarm as to the temper which she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was
exhibiting.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, well! I am a fool,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I want thee to think well of me,
Harry!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the youth</b></font>)</div><p/>A hand is somehow put out and seized and, no doubt, kissed by the
rapturous youth. <div class="bookquote">``Angel!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) cries, looking into her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) face with his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
eager, honest eyes.

<p/>Two fish-pools irradiated by a pair of stars would not kindle to greater
warmth than did those elderly orbs into which Harry poured his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) gaze.
Nevertheless, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) plunged into their blue depths, and fancied he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) saw
heaven in their calm brightness. So that silly dog -LRB-of whom Aesop or the
Spelling-book used to tell us in youth-RRB- beheld a beef-bone in the pond,
and snapped at it, and lost the beef-bone he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was carrying. O absurd cur!
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) saw the beefbone in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) own mouth reflected in the treacherous pool,
which dimpled, I dare say, with ever so many smiles, coolly sucked up
the meat, and returned to its usual placidity. Ah! what a heap of wreck
lie beneath some of those quiet surfaces! What treasures we have dropped
into them! What chased golden dishes, what precious jewels of love, what
bones after bones, and sweetest heart's flesh! Do not some very faithful
and unlucky dogs jump in bodily, when they are swallowed up heads and
tails entirely? When some women come to be dragged, it is a marvel what
will be found in the depths of them. Cavete, canes! Have a care how ye
lap that water. What do they want with us, the mischievous siren sluts?
A green-eyed Naiad never rests until she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) has inveigled a fellow under
the water; she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) sings after him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) dances after him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) winds round
him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>), glittering tortuously; she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) warbles and whispers dainty secrets at
his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) cheek, she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) kisses his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) feet, she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) leers at him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) from out of her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) rushes:
all her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) beds sigh out, <div class="bookquote">``Come, sweet youth! Hither, hither, rosy Hylas!''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Pop goes Hylas. -LRB-Surely the fable is renewed for ever and ever?-RRB- Has his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)
captivator any pleasure? Doth she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) take any account of him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)? No more than
a fisherman landing at Brighton does of one out of a hundred thousand
herrings... The last time. Ulysses rowed by the Sirens' bank, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ulysses</b></font>) and
his (<font color='blue'><b>Ulysses</b></font>) men did not care though a whole shoal of them were singing and
combing their longest locks. Young Telemachus was for jumping overboard:
but the tough old crew held the silly, bawling lad. They were deaf, and
could not hear his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) bawling nor the sea-nymphs' singing. They were dim
of sight, and did not see how lovely the witches were. The stale, old,
leering witches! Away with ye! I dare say you have painted your cheeks
by this time; your wretched old songs are as out of fashion as Mozart,
and it is all false hair you are combing!

<p/>In the last sentence you see Lector Benevolus and Scriptor Doctissimus
figure as tough old Ulysses and his (<font color='blue'><b>Ulysses</b></font>) tough old Boatswain, who do not care
a quid of tobacco for any Siren at Sirens' Point; but Harry Warrington
is green Telemachus, who, be sure, was very unlike the soft youth in the
good Bishop of Cambray's twaddling story. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bishop</b></font>) does not see that the siren
paints the lashes from under which she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) ogles him (<font color='blue'><b>Bishop</b></font>); will put by into a box
when she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) has done the ringlets into which she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) would inveigle him (<font color='blue'><b>Bishop</b></font>); and
if she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) eats him (<font color='blue'><b>Bishop</b></font>), as she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) proposes to do, will crunch his (<font color='blue'><b>Bishop</b></font>) bones with a new
set of grinders just from the dentist's, and warranted for mastication.
The song is not stale to Harry Warrington, nor the voice cracked or out
of tune that sings it. But--but--oh, dear me, Brother Boatswain! Don't
you remember how pleasant the opera was when we first heard it? Cosi
fan tutti was its name--Mozart's music. Now, I dare say, they have other
words, and other music, and other singers and fiddlers, and another
great crowd in the pit. Well, well, Cosi fan tutti is still upon the
bills, and they are going on singing it over and over and over.

<p/>Any man or woman with a pennyworth of brains, or the like precious
amount of personal experience, or who has read a novel before, must,
when Harry pulled out those faded vegetables just now, have gone off
into a digression of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) own, as the writer confesses for himself he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was
diverging whilst he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) has been writing the last brace of paragraphs. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
sees a pair of lovers whispering in a garden alley or the embrasure of
a window, or a pair of glances shot across the room from Jenny to the
artless Jessamy, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) falls to musing on former days when, etc. etc.. These
things follow each other by a general law, which is not as old as the
hills, to be sure, but as old as the people who walk up and down them.
When, I say, a lad pulls a bunch of amputated and now decomposing greens
from his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) breast and falls to kissing it, what is the use of saying much
more? As well tell the market-gardener's name from whom the slip-rose
was bought--the waterings, clippings, trimmings, manurings, the plant
has undergone--as tell how Harry Warrington came by it. Rose, elle a
vecu la vie des roses, has been trimmed, has been watered, has been
potted, has been sticked, has been cut, worn, given away, transferred
to yonder boy's pocket-book and bosom, according to the laws and fate
appertaining to roses.

<p/>And how came Maria to give it to Harry? And how did he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) come to want it
and to prize it so passionately when he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) got the bit of rubbish? Is not
one story as stale as the other? Are not they all alike? What is the
use, I say, of telling them over and over? Harry values that rose
because Maria has ogled him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) in the old way; because she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) has happened to
meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) in the garden in the old way; because he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) has taken her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) hand in
the old way; because they have whispered to one another behind the old
curtain -LRB-the gaping old rag, as if everybody could not peep through
it!-RRB-; because, in this delicious weather, they have happened to be early
risers and go into the park; because dear Goody Jenkins in the village
happened to have a bad knee, and my lady Maria went to read to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>), and
gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) calves'-foot jelly, and because somebody, of course, must carry
the basket. Whole chapters might have been written to chronicle
all these circumstances, but A quoi bon? The incidents of life, and
love-making especially, I believe to resemble each other so much, that
I am surprised, gentlemen and ladies, you read novels any more. Psha! Of
course that rose in young Harry's pocket-book had grown, and had budded,
and had bloomed, and was now rotting, like other roses. I suppose you
will want me to say that the young fool kissed it next? Of course he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>)
kissed it. What were lips made for, pray, but for smiling and simpering,
and -LRB-possibly-RRB- humbugging, and kissing, and opening to receive
mutton-chops, cigars, and so forth? I cannot write this part of the
story of our Virginians, because Harry did not dare to write it himself
to anybody at home, because, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wrote any letters to Maria -LRB-which,
of course, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) did, as they were in the same house, and might meet each
other as much as they liked-RRB-, they were destroyed; because he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) afterwards
chose to be very silent about the story, and we can't have it from her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>)
ladyship, who never told the truth about anything. But cui bono? I say
again. What is the good of telling the story? My gentle reader, take
your story: take mine. To-morrow it shall be Miss Fanny's, who is just
walking away with her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) doll to the schoolroom and the governess -LRB-poor
victim! she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) has a version of it in her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) desk-RRB-: and next day it shall be
Baby's, who is bawling out on the stairs for his (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>) bottle.

<p/>Maria might like to have and exercise power over the young Virginian;
but she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) did not want that Harry should quarrel with his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) aunt for her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>)
sake, or that Madame de Bernstein should be angry with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>). Harry was
not the Lord of Virginia yet: he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was only the Prince, and the Queen
might marry and have other Princes, and the laws of primogeniture might
not be established in Virginia, qu’en savait elle? My lord her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) brother
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) had exchanged no words at all about the delicate business. But
they understood each other, and the Earl had a way of understanding
things without speaking. He (<font color='blue'><b>Earl</b></font>) knew his (<font color='blue'><b>Earl</b></font>) Maria perfectly well: in the course
of a life of which not a little had been spent in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) brother's company
and under his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) roof, Maria's disposition, ways, tricks, faults, had come
to be perfectly understood by the head of the family; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) would find
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) little schemes checked or aided by him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>), as to his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) lordship seemed
good, and without need of any words between them. Thus three days
before, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) happened to be going to see that poor dear old Goody,
who was ill with the sore knee in the village -LRB-and when Harry Warrington
happened to be walking behind the elms on the green too-RRB-, my lord with
his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) dogs about him (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>), and his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) gardener walking after him (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>), crossed the
court, just as Lady Maria was tripping to the gate-house--and his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>)
lordship called his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) sister, and said: <div class="bookquote">``Molly, you are going to see Goody
Jenkins. You are a charitable soul, my dear. Give Gammer Jenkins this
half-crown for me--unless our cousin, Warrington, has already given her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
money. A pleasant walk to you. Let her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) want for nothing.''  (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div>And at supper,
my lord asked Mr. Warrington many questions about the poor in Virginia,
and the means of maintaining them, to which the young gentleman gave the
best answers he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) might. His (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) lordship wished that in the old country there
were no more poor people than in the new: and recommended Harry to
visit the poor and people of every degree, indeed, high and low--in the
country to look at the agriculture, in the city at the manufactures
and municipal institutions--to which edifying advice Harry acceded with
becoming modesty and few words, and Madame Bernstein nodded approval
over her (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) piquet with the chaplain. Next day, Harry was in my lord's
justice-room: the next day he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was out ever so long with my lord on
the farm--and coming home, what does my lord do, but look in on a
sick tenant? I think Lady Maria was out on that day, too; she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) had been
reading good books to that poor dear Goody Jenkins, though I don't
suppose Madame Bernstein ever thought of asking about her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) niece.


<p/>``CASTLEWOOD, HAMPSHIRE, ENGLAND, August 5, 1757.

<p/>``MY DEAR MOUNTAIN--At first, as I wrote, I did not like Castlewood, nor
my cousins there, very much. Now, I am used to their ways, and we begin
to understand each other much better. With my duty to my mother, tell
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), I hope, that considering her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) ladyship's great kindness to me, Madam
Esmond will be reconciled to her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) half-sister, the Baroness de Bernstein.
The Baroness, you know, was my Grandmamma's daughter by her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) first
husband, Lord Castlewood -LRB-only Grandpapa really was the real lord-RRB-;
however, that was not his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>), that is, the other Lord Castlewood's fault,
you know, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) was very kind to Grandpapa, who always spoke most
kindly of him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) to us as you know.

<p/>``Madame the Baroness Bernstein first married a clergyman, Reverend
Mr. Tusher, who was so learned and good, and such a favourite of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tusher</b></font>)
Majesty, as was my aunt too, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tusher</b></font>) was made a Bishop. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Tusher</b></font>) died,
Our gracious King continued his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) friendship to my aunt; who married a
Hanoverian nobleman, who occupied a post at the Court--and, I believe,
left the Baroness very rich. My cousin, my Lord Castlewood, told me
so much about her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>), and I am sure I have found from her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) the greatest
kindness and affection.

<p/>``The -LRB-Dowiger-RRB- Countess Castlewood and my cousins Will and Lady Fanny
have been described per last, that went by the Falmouth packet on the
20th ult. The ladies are not changed since then. Me and Cousin Will are
very good friends. We have rode out a good deal. We have had some famous
cocking matches at Hampton and Winton. My cousin is a sharp blade, but I
think I have shown him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) that we in Virginia know a thing or two. Reverend
Mr. Sampson, chaplain of the famaly, most excellent preacher, without
any biggatry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The kindness of my cousin the Earl improves every day, and by next
year's ship I hope my mother will send his (<font color='blue'><b>Earl</b></font>) lordship some of our best
roll tobacco -LRB-for tennants-RRB- and hamms. He (<font color='blue'><b>Earl</b></font>) is most charatable to the
poor. His (<font color='blue'><b>Earl</b></font>) sister, Lady Maria, equally so. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) sits for hours reading
good books to the sick: she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) is most beloved in the village.''


 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nonsense!''  (<font color='red'><b>a lady</b></font>)</div>said a lady to whom Harry submitted his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) precious manuscript.
<div class="bookquote">``Why do you flatter me, cousin?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are beloved in the village and out of it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>said Harry, with a
knowing emphasis, <div class="bookquote">``and I have flattered you, as you call it, a little
more still, farther on.''


 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div><p/>``There is a sick old woman there, whom Madam Esmond would like, a most
raligious, good, old lady.

<p/>``Lady Maria goes very often to read to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>); which, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) says, gives
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) comfort. But though her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) Ladyship hath the sweetest voice, both in
speaking and singeing -LRB-she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) plays the church organ, and singes there most
beautifully-RRB-, I cannot think Gammer Jenkins can have any comfort from
it, being very deaf, by reason of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) great age. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) has her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) memory
perfectly, however, and remembers when my honoured Grandmother Rachel
Lady Castlewood lived here. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) says, my Grandmother was the best woman
in the whole world, gave her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) a cow when she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was married, and cured her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
husband, Gaffer Jenkins, of the collects, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Jenkins</b></font>) used to have very
bad. I suppose it was with the Pills and Drops which my honoured Mother
put up in my boxes, when I left dear Virginia. Having never been ill
since, have had no use for the pills. Gumbo hath, eating and drinking
a great deal too much in the Servants' Hall. The next angel to my
Grandmother -LRB-N.B. I think I spelt angel wrong per last-RRB-, Gammer Jenkins
says, is Lady Maria, who sends her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) duty to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) Aunt in Virginia, and
remembers her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>), and my Grandpapa and Grandmamma when they were in Europe,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) was a little girl. You know they have Grandpapa's picture here,
and I live in the very rooms which he (<font color='blue'><b>Jenkins</b></font>) had, and which are to be called
mine, my Lord Castlewood says.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Having no more to say, at present, I close with best love and duty to
my honoured Mother, and with respects to Mr. Dempster, and a kiss for
Fanny, and kind remembrances to Old Gumbo, Nathan, Old and Young Dinah,

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Have wrote and sent my duty to my Uncle Warrington in Norfolk. No anser

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope the spelling is right, cousin?''  (<font color='red'><b>the author</b></font>)</div>asked the author of the letter,
from the critic to whom he (<font color='blue'><b>critic</b></font>) showed it.

<p/>```Tis quite well enough spelt for any person of fashion,'' answered
Lady Maria, who did not choose to be examined too closely regarding the
orthography.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``One word `Angel,' I know, I spelt wrong in writing to my mamma, but I
have learned a way of spelling it right, now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And how is that, sir?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think `tis by looking at you, cousin;''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Harry/Mr. Harry Warrington</b></font>)</div>saying which words, Mr. Harry
made her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) ladyship a low bow, and accompanied the bow by one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) best
blushes, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) were offering her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) a bow and a bouquet.




<p/>CHAPTER XIX. Containing both Love and Luck


<p/>At the next meal, when the family party assembled, there was not a trace
of displeasure in Madame de Bernstein's countenance, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) behaviour
to all the company, Harry included, was perfectly kind and cordial. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>)
praised the cook this time, declared the fricassee was excellent, and
that there were no eels anywhere like those in the Castlewood moats;
would not allow that the wine was corked, or hear of such extravagance
as opening a fresh bottle for a useless old woman like her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>); gave Madam
Esmond Warrington, of Virginia, as her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) toast, when the new wine was
brought, and hoped Harry had brought away his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) mamma's permission to take
back an English wife with him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) did not remember his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) grandmother; her (<font color='blue'><b>grandmother</b></font>),
Madame de Bernstein's, dear mother? The Baroness amused the company
with numerous stories of her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) mother, of her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) beauty and goodness, of her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>)
happiness with her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) second husband, though the wife was so much older
than Colonel Esmond. To see them together was delightful, she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) had heard.
Their attachment was celebrated all through the country. To talk of
disparity in marriages was vain after that. My Lady Castlewood and her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>)
two children held their peace whilst Madame Bernstein prattled. Harry
was enraptured, and Maria surprised. Lord Castlewood was puzzled to know
what sudden freak or scheme had occasioned this prodigious amiability
on the part of his (<font color='blue'><b>Castlewood</b></font>) aunt; but did not allow the slightest expression of
solicitude or doubt to appear on his (<font color='blue'><b>Castlewood</b></font>) countenance, which wore every mark
of the most perfect satisfaction.

<p/>The Baroness's good-humour infected the whole family; not one person at
table escaped a gracious word from her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>). In reply to some compliment to
Mr. Will, when that artless youth uttered an expression of satisfaction
and surprise at his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) aunt's behaviour, she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) frankly said: <div class="bookquote">``Complimentary,
my dear! Of course I am. I want to make up with you for having been
exceedingly rude to everybody this morning. When I was a child, and my
father and mother were alive, and lived here, I remember I used to adopt
exactly the same behaviour. If I had been naughty in the morning, I used
to try and coax my parents at night. I remember in this very room, at
this very table--oh, ever so many hundred years ago!--so coaxing my
father, and mother, and your grandfather, Harry Warrington; and there
were eels for supper, as we have had them to-night, and it was that dish
of collared eels which brought the circumstance back to my mind. I
had been just as wayward that day, when I was seven years old, as I
am to-day, when I am seventy, and so I confess my sins, and ask to be
forgiven, like a good girl.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I absolve your ladyship!''  (<font color='red'><b>the chaplain</b></font>)</div>cried the chaplain, who made one of the
party.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But your reverence does not know how cross and ill-tempered I was. I
scolded my sister, Castlewood: I scolded her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) children, I boxed Harry
Warrington's ears: and all because he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) would not go with me to Tunbridge
Wells.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I will go, madam; I will ride with you with all the pleasure in
life,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Warrington.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You see, Mr. Chaplain, what good, dutiful children they all are. `Twas
I alone who was cross and peevish. Oh, it was cruel of me to treat them
so! Maria, I ask your pardon, my dear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sure, madam, you have done me no wrong,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maria/Lady Maria/Lady Maria Esmond</b></font>)</div>says Maria to this humble
suppliant.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed, I have, a very great wrong, child! Because I was weary of
myself, I told you that your company would be wearisome to me. You
offered to come with me to Tunbridge, and I rudely refused you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Nay, ma’am, if you were sick, and my presence annoyed you...

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But it will not annoy me! You were most kind to say that you would
come. I do, of all things, beg, pray, entreat, implore, command that you
will come.''

 (<font color='red'><b>lord</b></font>)</div><p/>My lord filled himself a glass, and sipped it. Most utterly unconscious
did his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) lordship look. This, then, was the meaning of the previous
comedy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Anything which can give my aunt pleasure, I am sure, will delight me,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Maria/Lady Maria/Lady Maria Esmond</b></font>)</div>said Maria, trying to look as happy as possible.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You must come and stay with me, my dear, and I promise to be good and
good-humoured. My dear lord, you will spare your sister to me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Lady Maria Esmond is quite of age to judge for herself about such a
matter,''  (<font color='red'><b>lordship</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) lordship, with a bow. <div class="bookquote">``If any of us can be of use
to you, madam, you sure ought to command us.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Which sentence, being
interpreted, no doubt meant, <div class="bookquote">``Plague take the old woman! She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is taking
Maria away in order to separate her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) from this young Virginian.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Tunbridge will be delightful!''  (<font color='red'><b>Maria/Lady Maria/Lady Maria Esmond</b></font>)</div>sighed Lady Maria.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Sampson will go and see Goody Jones for you,''  (<font color='red'><b>lord</b></font>)</div>my lord continued.

<p/>Harry drew pictures with his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) finger on the table. What delights had
he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) not been speculating on? What walks, what rides, what interminable
conversations, what delicious shrubberies and sweet sequestered
summer-houses, what poring over music-books, what moonlight, what
billing and cooing, had he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) not imagined! Yes, the day was coming. They
were all departing--my Lady Castlewood to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) friends, Madame
Bernstein to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) waters--and he (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>) was to be left alone with his (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>) divine
charmer--alone with her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) and unutterable rapture! The thought of the
pleasure was maddening. That these people were all going away. That he (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>)
was to be left to enjoy that heaven--to sit at the feet of that angel
and kiss the hem of that white robe. O Gods! `twas too great bliss to
be real! <div class="bookquote">``I knew it couldn't be,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>thought poor Harry. <div class="bookquote">``I knew something
would happen to take her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) from me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you will ride with us to Tunbridge, nephew Warrington, and keep us
from the highwaymen?''  (<font color='red'><b>Bernstein/Madame de Bernstein/Madame Bernstein</b></font>)</div>said Madame de Bernstein.

<p/>Harry Warrington hoped the company did not see how red he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) grew. He (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) tried
to keep his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) voice calm and without tremor. Yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) would ride with their
ladyships, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) was sure they need fear no danger. Danger! Harry
felt he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) would rather like danger than not. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) would slay ten thousand
highwaymen if they approached his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) mistress's coach. At least, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) would
ride by that coach, and now and again see her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) eyes at the window. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
might not speak to her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>), but he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) should be near her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) should press the
blessed hand at the inn at night, and feel it reposing on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) led
her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) to the carriage at morning. They would be two whole days going
to Tunbridge, and one day or two he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) might stay there. Is not the poor
wretch who is left for execution at Newgate thankful for even two or
three days of respite?

<p/>You see, we have only indicated, we have not chosen to describe,
at length, Mr. Harry Warrington's condition, or that utter depth of
imbecility into which the poor young wretch was now plunged. Some boys
have the complaint of love favourably and gently. Others, when they get
the fever, are sick unto death with it; or, recovering, carry the marks
of the malady down with them to the grave, or to remotest old age.
I say, it is not fair to take down a young fellow's words when he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) is
raging in that delirium. Suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) is in love with a woman twice as old
as himself; have we not all read of the young gentleman who committed
suicide in consequence of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) fatal passion for Mademoiselle Ninon de
l’Enclos who turned out to be his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) grandmother? Suppose thou art making
an ass of thyself, young Harry Warrington, of Virginia! are there not
people in England who heehaw too? Kick and abuse him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>), you who have never
brayed; but bear with him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>), all honest fellow-cardophagi: long-eared
messmates, recognise a brother-donkey!

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You will stay with us for a day or two at the Wells,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame</b></font>)</div>Madame Bernstein
continued. <div class="bookquote">``You will see us put into our lodgings. Then you can return
to Castlewood and the partridge-shooting, and all the fine things which
you and my lord are to study together.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry bowed an acquiescence. A whole week of heaven! Life was not
altogether a blank, then.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And as there is sure to be plenty of company at the Wells, I shall be
able to present you,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>the lady graciously added.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Company! ah! I shan't need company,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>sighed out Harry. <div class="bookquote">``I mean that I
shall be quite contented in the company of you two ladies,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) added,
eagerly; and no doubt Mr. Will wondered at his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) cousin's taste.

<p/>As this was to be the last night of cousin Harry's present visit to
Castlewood, cousin Will suggested that he (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>), and his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) reverence, and
Warrington should meet at the quarters of the latter and make up
accounts, to which process, Harry, being a considerable winner in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
play transactions with the two gentlemen, had no objection. Accordingly,
when the ladies retired for the night, and my lord withdrew--as his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>)
custom was--to his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) own apartments, the three gentlemen all found
themselves assembled in Mr. Harry's little room before the punch-bowl,
which was Will's usual midnight companion.

<p/>But Will's method of settling accounts was by producing a couple of
fresh packs of cards, and offering to submit Harry's debt to the process
of being doubled or acquitted. The poor chaplain had no more ready cash
than Lord Castlewood's younger brother. Harry Warrington wanted to win
the money of neither. Would he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) give pain to the brother of his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) adored
Maria, or allow any one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) near kinsfolk to tax him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) with any want of
generosity or forbearance? He (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) was ready to give them their revenge, as
the gentlemen proposed. Up to midnight he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) would play with them for what
stakes they chose to name. And so they set to work, and the dice-box was
rattled and the cards shuffled and dealt.

<p/>Very likely he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) did not think about the cards at all. Very likely he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) was
thinking;--<div class="bookquote">``At this moment, my beloved one is sitting with her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) beauteous
golden locks outspread under the fingers of her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) maid. Happy maid! Now
she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) is on her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) knees, the sainted creature, addressing prayers to that
Heaven which is the abode of angels like her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>). Now she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) has sunk to rest
behind her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) damask curtains. Oh, bless, bless her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You double us all
round? I will take a card upon each of my two. Thank you, that will
do--a ten--now, upon the other, a queen,--two natural vingt-et-uns, and
as you doubled us you owe me so-and-so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I imagine volleys of oaths from Mr. William, and brisk pattering of
imprecations from his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) reverence, at the young Virginian's luck. He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) won
because he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) did not want to win. Fortune, that notoriously coquettish
jade, came to him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>), because he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) was thinking of another nymph, who
possibly was as fickle. Will and the chaplain may have played against
him (<font color='blue'><b>chaplain</b></font>), solicitous constantly to increase their stakes, and supposing that
the wealthy Virginian wished to let them recover all their losings. But
this was by no means Harry Warrington's notion. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) was at home he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>)
had taken a part in scores of such games as these -LRB-whereby we may be led
to suppose that he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) kept many little circumstances of his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) life mum from
his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) lady mother-RRB-, and had learned to play and pay. And as he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) practised
fair play towards his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) friends he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) expected it from them in return.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The luck does seem to be with me, cousin,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) said, in reply to some
more oaths and growls of Will, <div class="bookquote">``and I am sure I do not want to press it;
but you don't suppose I'm going to be such a fool as to fling it away
altogether? I have quite a heap of your promises on paper by this time.
If we are to go on playing, let us have the dollars on the table, if you
please; or, if not the money, the worth of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Always the way with you rich men,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>grumbled Will. <div class="bookquote">``Never lend except on
security--always win because you are rich.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Faith, cousin, you have been of late for ever flinging my riches into
my face. I have enough for my wants and for my creditors.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, that we could all say as much!''  (<font color='red'><b>the chaplain</b></font>)</div>groaned the chaplain. <div class="bookquote">``How happy
we, and how happy the duns would be! What have we got to play against
our conqueror? There is my new gown, Mr. Warrington. Will you set me
five pieces against it? I have but to preach in stuff if I lose. Stop! I
have a Chrysostom, a Foxe's Martyrs, a Baker's Chronicle, and a cow and
her (<font color='blue'><b>Baker</b></font>) calf. What shall we set against these?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will bet one of cousin Will's notes for twenty pounds,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>cried Mr.
Warrington, producing one of those documents.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Or I have my brown mare, and will back her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) red against your honour's
notes of hand, but against ready money.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have my horse. I will back my horse against you for fifty,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>bawls out
Will.

<p/>Harry took the offers of both gentlemen. In the course of ten minutes
the horse and the bay mare had both changed owners. Cousin William swore
more fiercely than ever. The parson dashed his (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) wig to the ground,
and emulated his (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) pupil in the loudness of his (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) objurgations. Mr. Harry
Warrington was quite calm, and not the least elated by his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) triumph.
They had asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) to play, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) had played. He (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) should win. O
beloved slumbering angel! he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) thought, am I not sure of victory when you
are kind to me? He (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) was looking out from his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) window towards the casement
on the opposite side of the court, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) knew to be hers. He (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) had
forgot about his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) victims and their groans, and ill-luck, ere they
crossed the court. Under yonder brilliant flickering star, behind yonder
casement where the lamp was burning faintly, was his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) joy, and heart, and
treasure.




<p/>CHAPTER XX. Facilis Descensus


<p/>Whilst the good old Bishop of Cambray, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bishop</b></font>) romance lately mentioned,
described the disconsolate condition of Calypso at the departure of
Ulysses, I forget whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Bishop</b></font>) mentioned the grief of Calypso's lady's
maid on taking leave of Odysseus's own gentleman. The menials must have
wept together in the kitchen precincts whilst the master and mistress
took a last wild embrace in the drawing-room; they must have hung round
each other in the fore-cabin, whilst their principals broke their hearts
in the grand saloon. When the bell rang for the last time, and Ulysses's
mate bawled, <div class="bookquote">``Now! any one for shore!''  (<font color='red'><b>Ulysses mate</b></font>)</div>Calypso and her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) female attendant
must have both walked over the same plank, with beating hearts and
streaming eyes; both must have waved pocket-handkerchiefs -LRB-of far
different value and texture-RRB-, as they stood on the quay, to their
friends on the departing vessel, whilst the people on the land, and the
crew crowding in the ship's bows, shouted hip, hip, huzzay -LRB-or whatever
may be the equivalent Greek for the salutation-RRB- to all engaged on that
voyage. But the point to be remembered is, that if Calypso ne pouvait
se consoler, Calypso's maid ne pouvait se consoler non plus. They had to
walk the same plank of grief, and feel the same pang of separation; on
their return home, they might not use pocket-handkerchiefs of the same
texture and value, but the tears, no doubt, were as salt and plentiful
which one shed in her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) marble halls, and the other poured forth in the
servants' ditto.

<p/>Not only did Harry Warrington leave Castlewood a victim to love, but
Gumbo quitted the same premises a prey to the same delightful passion.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) wit, accomplishments, good-humour, his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) skill in dancing, cookery,
and music, had endeared him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) to the whole female domestic circle. More
than one of the men might be jealous of him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>), but the ladies all were
with him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>). There was no such objection to the poor black men then in
England as has obtained since among white-skinned people. Theirs was
a condition not perhaps of equality, but they had a sufferance and
a certain grotesque sympathy from all; and from women, no doubt, a
kindness much more generous. When Ledyard and Parke, in Blackmansland,
were persecuted by the men, did they not find the black women pitiful
and kind to them? Women are always kind towards our sex. What -LRB-mental-RRB-
negroes do they not cherish? what -LRB-moral-RRB- hunchbacks do they not adore?
what lepers, what idiots, what dull drivellers, what misshapen monsters
-LRB-I speak figuratively-RRB- do they not fondle and cuddle? Gumbo was treated
by the women as kindly as many people no better than himself: it was
only the men in the servants'-hall who rejoiced at the Virginian lad's
departure. I should like to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Virginian</b></font>) taking leave. I should like to see
Molly housemaid stealing to the terrace-gardens in the grey dawning to
cull a wistful posy. I should like to see Betty kitchenmaid cutting off
a thick lock of her (<font color='blue'><b>Betty</b></font>) chestnut ringlets which she (<font color='blue'><b>Betty</b></font>) proposed to exchange for
a woolly token from young Gumbo's pate. Of course he (<font color='blue'><b>Virginian</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>Virginian</b></font>) was regum
progenies, a descendant of Ashantee kings. In Caffraria, Connaught and
other places now inhabited by hereditary bondsmen, there must have been
vast numbers of these potent sovereigns in former times, to judge from
their descendants now extant.

<p/>At the morning announced for Madame de Bernstein's departure, all the
numerous domestics of Castlewood crowded about the doors and passages,
some to have a last glimpse of her (<font color='blue'><b>Betty</b></font>) ladyship's men and the fascinating
Gumbo, some to take leave of her (<font color='blue'><b>Betty</b></font>) ladyship's maid, all to waylay the
Baroness and her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) nephew for parting fees, which it was the custom of
that day largely to distribute among household servants. One and the
other gave liberal gratuities to the liveried society, to the gentlemen
in black and ruffles, and to the swarm of female attendants. Castlewood
was the home of the Baroness's youth; and as for her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) honest Harry, who
had not only lived at free charges in the house, but had won horses and
money--or promises of money--from his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) cousin and the unlucky chaplain,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was naturally of a generous turn, and felt that at this moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
ought not to stint his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) benevolent disposition. <div class="bookquote">``My mother, I know,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
thought, <div class="bookquote">``will wish me to be liberal to all the retainers of the Esmond
family.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>So he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) scattered about his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) gold pieces to right and left, and
as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had been as rich as Gumbo announced him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) to be. There was no one
who came near him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) but had a share in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) bounty. From the major-domo to
the shoeblack, Mr. Harry had a peace-offering for them all. To the grim
housekeeper in her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) still-room, to the feeble old porter in his (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) lodge,
he (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) distributed some token of his (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) remembrance. When a man is in love with
one woman in a family, it is astonishing how fond he (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) becomes of every
person connected with it. He (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) ingratiates himself with the maids; he (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) is
bland with the butler; he (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) interests himself about the footman; he (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) runs
on errands for the daughters; he (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) gives advice and lends money to the
young son at college; he (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) pats little dogs which he (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) would kick otherwise;
he (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) smiles at old stories which would make him (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) break out in yawns, were
they uttered by any one but papa; he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) drinks sweet port wine for which he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>)
would curse the steward and the whole committee of a club; he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) bears even
with the cantankerous old maiden aunt; he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) beats time when darling little
Fanny performs her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) piece on the piano; and smiles when wicked, lively
little Bobby upsets the coffee over his (<font color='blue'><b>Bobby</b></font>) shirt.

<p/>Harry Warrington, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) way, and according to the customs of that age,
had for a brief time past -LRB-by which I conclude that only for a brief
time had his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) love been declared and accepted-RRB- given to the Castlewood
family all these artless testimonies of his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) affection for one of them.
Cousin Will should have won back his (<font color='blue'><b>Cousin</b></font>) money and welcome, or have won
as much of Harry's own as the lad could spare. Nevertheless, the lad,
though a lover, was shrewd, keen, and fond of sport and fair play, and a
judge of a good horse when he (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) saw one. Having played for and won all the
money which Will had, besides a great number of Mr. Esmond's valuable
autographs, Harry was very well pleased to win Will's brown horse--that
very quadruped which had nearly pushed him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) into the water on the
first evening of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) arrival at Castlewood. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had seen the horse's
performance often, and in the midst of all his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) passion and romance, was
not sorry to be possessed of such a sound, swift, well-bred hunter and
roadster. When he (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) had gazed at the stars sufficiently as they shone over
his (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) mistress's window, and put her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) candle to bed, he (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) repaired to his (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) own
dormitory, and there, no doubt, thought of his (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) Maria and his (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) horse with
youthful satisfaction, and how sweet it would be to have one pillioned
on the other, and to make the tour of all the island on such an
animal with such a pair of white arms round his (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) waist. He (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) fell asleep
ruminating on these things, and meditating a million of blessings on his (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>)
Maria, in whose company he (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) was to luxuriate at least for a week more.

<p/>In the early morning poor Chaplain Sampson sent over his (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) little black
mare by the hands of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) groom, footman, and gardener, who wept and
bestowed a great number of kisses on the beast's white nose as he (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>)
handed him (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) over to Gumbo. Gumbo and his (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) master were both affected by the
fellow's sensibility; the negro servant showing his (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) sympathy by weeping,
and Harry by producing a couple of guineas, with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) astonished and
speedily comforted the chaplain's boy. Then Gumbo and the late groom led
the beast away to the stable, having commands to bring him (<font color='blue'><b>groom</b></font>) round with
Mr. William's horse after breakfast, at the hour when Madam Bernstein's
carriages were ordered.

<p/>So courteous was he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) aunt, or so grateful for her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) departure, that
the master of the house even made his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) appearance at the morning meal,
in order to take leave of his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) guests. The ladies and the chaplain were
present--the only member of the family absent was Will: who, however,
left a note for his (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) cousin, in which Will stated, in exceedingly
bad spelling, that he (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) was obliged to go away to Salisbury Races that
morning, but that he (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) had left the horse which his (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) cousin won last night,
and which Tom, Mr. Will's groom, would hand over to Mr. Warrington's
servant. Will's absence did not prevent the rest of the party from
drinking a dish of tea amicably, and in due time the carriages rolled
into the courtyard, the servants packed them with the Baroness's
multiplied luggage, and the moment of departure arrived.

<p/>A large open landau contained the stout Baroness and her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) niece; a
couple of men-servants mounting on the box before them with pistols and
blunderbusses ready in event of a meeting with highwaymen. In another
carriage were their ladyships' maids, and another servant in guard
of the trunks, which, vast and numerous as they were, were as nothing
compared to the enormous baggage-train accompanying a lady of the
present time. Mr. Warrington's modest valises were placed in this second
carriage under the maid's guardianship, and Mr. Gumbo proposed to ride
by the window for the chief part of the journey.

<p/>My lord, with his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) stepmother and Lady Fanny, accompanied their kinswoman
to the carriage steps, and bade her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) farewell with many dutiful embraces.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) Lady Maria followed in a riding-dress, which Harry Warrington
thought the most becoming costume in the world. A host of servants stood
around, and begged Heaven bless her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) ladyship. The Baroness's departure
was known in the village, and scores of the folks there stood waiting
under the trees outside the gates, and huzzayed and waved their hats as
the ponderous vehicles rolled away.

<p/>Gumbo was gone for Mr. Warrington's horses, as my lord, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) arm
under his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) young guest's, paced up and down the court. <div class="bookquote">``I hear you carry
away some of our horses out of Castlewood?''  (<font color='red'><b>lord</b></font>)</div>my lord said.

<p/>Harry blushed. <div class="bookquote">``A gentleman cannot refuse a fair game at the cards,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
said. <div class="bookquote">``I never wanted to play, nor would have played for money had not
my cousin William forced me. As for the chaplain, it went to my heart to
win from him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>), but he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) was as eager as my cousin.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know--I know! There is no blame to you, my boy. At Rome you can't
help doing as Rome does; and I am very glad that you have been able to
give Will a lesson. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) is mad about play--would gamble his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) coat off his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
back--and I and the family have had to pay his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) debts ever so many times.
May I ask how much you have won of him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, some eighteen pieces the first day or two, and his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) note for a
hundred and twenty more, and the brown horse, sixty--that makes nigh
upon two hundred. But, you know, cousin, all was fair, and it was even
against my will that we played at all. Will ain't a match for me, my
lord--that is the fact. Indeed he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) is not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) is a match for most people, though,''  (<font color='red'><b>lord</b></font>)</div>said my lord. <div class="bookquote">``His (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) brown horse,
I think you said?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. His (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) brown horse--Prince William, out of Constitution. You don't
suppose I would set him (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) sixty against his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) bay, my lord?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I didn't know. I saw Will riding out this morning; most likely I
did not remark what horse he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) was on. And you won the black mare from the
parson?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``For fourteen. He (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) will mount Gumbo very well. Why does not the rascal
come round with the horses?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>Harry's mind was away to lovely Maria. He (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>)
longed to be trotting by her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) side.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``When you get to Tunbridge, cousin Harry, you must be on the look-out
against sharper players than the chaplain and Will. There is all sorts
of queer company at the Wells.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``A Virginian learns pretty well to take care of himself, my lord, says
Harry, with a knowing nod.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So it seems! I recommend my sister to thee, Harry. Although she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) is not
a baby in years, she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) is as innocent as one. Thou wilt see that she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) comes
to no mischief?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will guard her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) with my life, my lord!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>cries Harry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thou art a brave fellow. By the way, cousin, unless you are very fond
of Castlewood, I would in your case not be in a great hurry to return to
this lonely, tumble-down old house. I want myself to go to another place
I have, and shall scarce be back here till the partridge-shooting. Go
you and take charge of the women, of my sister and the Baroness, will
you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed I will,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>said Harry, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) heart beating with happiness at the
thought.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And I will write thee word when you shall bring my sister back to me.
Here come the horses. Have you bid adieu to the Countess and Lady Fanny?
They are kissing their hands to you from the music-room balcony.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry ran up to bid these ladies a farewell. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) made that ceremony very
brief, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was anxious to be off to the charmer of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) heart; and
came downstairs to mount his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) newly-gotten steed, which Gumbo, himself
astride on the parson's black mare, held by the rein.

<p/>There was Gumbo on the black mare, indeed, and holding another horse.
But it was a bay horse, not a brown--a bay horse with broken knees--an
aged, worn-out quadruped.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is this?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>cries Harry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your honour's new horse,''  (<font color='red'><b>the groom</b></font>)</div>says the groom, touching his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) cap.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This brute?''  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>exclaims the young gentleman, with one or more of those
expressions then in use in England and Virginia. <div class="bookquote">``Go and bring me round
Prince William, Mr. William's horse, the brown horse.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. William have rode Prince William this morning away to Salisbury
Races. His (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) last words was, `Sam, saddle my bay horse, Cato, for Mr.
Warrington this morning. He (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) is Mr. Warrington's horse now. I sold him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) last night.' And I know your honour is bountiful: you will consider
the groom.''

 (<font color='red'><b>lord</b></font>)</div><p/>My lord could not help breaking into a laugh at these words of Sam the
groom, whilst Harry, for his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) part, indulged in a number more of those
remarks which politeness does not admit of our inserting here.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. William said he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) never could think of parting with the Prince under
a hundred and twenty,''  (<font color='red'><b>the groom</b></font>)</div>said the groom, looking at the young man.

<p/>Lord Castlewood only laughed the more. <div class="bookquote">``Will has been too much for thee,
Harry Warrington.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Too much for me, my lord! So may a fellow with loaded dice throw sixes,
and be too much for me. I do not call this betting, I call it ch--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Warrington! Spare me bad words about my brother, if you please.
Depend on it, I will take care that you are righted. Farewell. Ride
quickly, or your coaches will be at Farnham before you;''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>and waving him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>)
an adieu, my lord entered into the house, whilst Harry and his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) companion
rode out of the courtyard. The young Virginian was much too eager to
rejoin the carriages and his (<font color='blue'><b>Virginian</b></font>) charmer, to remark the unutterable love and
affection which Gumbo shot from his (<font color='blue'><b>Virginian</b></font>) fine eyes towards a young creature
in the porter's lodge.

<p/>When the youth was gone, the chaplain and my lord sate down to finish
their breakfast in peace and comfort. The two ladies did not return to
this meal.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That was one of Will's confounded rascally tricks,''  (<font color='red'><b>lord</b></font>)</div>says my lord. <div class="bookquote">``If
our cousin breaks Will's head I should not wonder.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) is used to the operation, my lord, and yet,''  (<font color='red'><b>the chaplain</b></font>)</div>adds the chaplain, with
a grin, <div class="bookquote">``when we were playing last night, the colour of the horse was
not mentioned. I could not escape, having but one: and the black boy
has ridden off on him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>). The young Virginian plays like a man, to do him (<font color='blue'><b>Virginian</b></font>)
justice.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the chaplain</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Virginian</b></font>) wins because he (<font color='blue'><b>Virginian</b></font>) does not care about losing. I think there can be
little doubt but that he (<font color='blue'><b>Virginian</b></font>) is very well to do. His (<font color='blue'><b>Virginian</b></font>) mother's law-agents are
my lawyers, and they write that the property is quite a principality,
and grows richer every year.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If it were a kingdom I know whom Mr. Warrington would make queen of
it,''  (<font color='red'><b>the chaplain</b></font>)</div>said the obsequious chaplain.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who can account for taste, parson?''  (<font color='red'><b>lordship</b></font>)</div>asks his (<font color='blue'><b>chaplain</b></font>) lordship, with a sneer.
<div class="bookquote">``All men are so. The first woman I was in love with myself was forty;
and as jealous as if she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had been fifteen. It runs in the family.
Colonel Esmond -LRB-he (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) in scarlet and the breastplate yonder-RRB- married my
grandmother, who was almost old enough to be his (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>). If this lad chooses to
take out an elderly princess to Virginia, we must not balk him (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>```Twere a consummation devoutly to be wished!'' cries the chaplain. <div class="bookquote">``Had
I not best go to Tunbridge Wells myself, my lord, and be on the spot,
and ready to exercise my sacred function in behalf of the young couple?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You shall have a pair of new nags, parson, if you do,''  (<font color='red'><b>lord</b></font>)</div>said my lord.
And with this we leave them peaceable over a pipe of tobacco after
breakfast.

<p/>Harry was in such a haste to join the carriages that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) almost forgot
to take off his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hat, and acknowledge the cheers of the Castlewood
villagers: they all liked the lad, whose frank cordial ways and honest
face got him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) a welcome in most places. Legends were still extant in
Castlewood, of his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) grandparents, and how his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) grandfather, Colonel
Esmond, might have been Lord Castlewood, but would not. Old Lockwood at
the gate often told of the Colonel's gallantry in Queen Anne's wars.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) feats were exaggerated, the behaviour of the present family was
contrasted with that of the old lord and lady: who might not have been
very popular in their time, but were better folks than those now in
possession. Lord Castlewood was a hard landlord: perhaps more disliked
because he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) was known to be poor and embarrassed than because he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) was
severe. As for Mr. Will, nobody was fond of him (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>). The young gentleman had
had many brawls and quarrels about the village, had received and given
broken heads, had bills in the neighbouring towns which he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) could not or
would not pay; had been arraigned before the magistrates for tampering
with village girls, and waylaid and cudgelled by injured husbands,
fathers, sweethearts. A hundred years ago his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) character and actions
might have been described at length by the painter of manners; but the
Comic Muse, nowadays, does not lift up Molly Seagrim's curtain; she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) only
indicates the presence of some one behind it, and passes on primly, with
expressions of horror, and a fan before her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) eyes. The village had
heard how the young Virginian squire had beaten Mr. Will at riding, at
jumping, at shooting, and finally at card-playing, for everything is
known; and they respected Harry all the more for this superiority. Above
all, they admired him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) on account of the reputation of enormous wealth
which Gumbo had made for his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) master. This fame had travelled over the
whole county, and was preceding him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) at this moment on the boxes of
Madame Bernstein's carriages, from which the valets, as they descended
at the inns to bait, spread astounding reports of the young Virginian's
rank and splendour. He (<font color='blue'><b>Virginian</b></font>) was a prince in his (<font color='blue'><b>Virginian</b></font>) own country. He (<font color='blue'><b>Virginian</b></font>) had gold
mines, diamond mines, furs, tobaccos, who knew what, or how much?
No wonder the honest Britons cheered him (<font color='blue'><b>Virginian</b></font>) and respected him (<font color='blue'><b>Virginian</b></font>) for his (<font color='blue'><b>Virginian</b></font>)
prosperity, as the noble-hearted fellows always do. I am surprised city
corporations did not address him (<font color='blue'><b>Virginian</b></font>), and offer gold boxes with the freedom
of the city--he (<font color='blue'><b>Virginian</b></font>) was so rich. Ah, a proud thing it is to be a Briton, and
think that there is no country where prosperity is so much respected as
in ours; and where success receives such constant affecting testimonials
of loyalty!

<p/>So, leaving the villagers bawling, and their hats tossing in the air,
Harry spurred his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) sorry beast, and galloped, with Gumbo behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>),
until he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) came up with the cloud of dust in the midst of which his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
charmer's chariot was enveloped. Penetrating into this cloud, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) found
himself at the window of the carriage. The Lady Maria had the back seat
to herself; by keeping a little behind the wheels, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could have the
delight of seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) divine eyes and smiles. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) held a finger to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>)
lip. Madame Bernstein was already dozing on her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) cushions. Harry did not
care to disturb the old lady. To look at his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) cousin was bliss enough for
him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). The landscape around him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) might be beautiful, but what did he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) heed
it? All the skies and trees of summer were as nothing compared to
yonder face; the hedgerow birds sang no such sweet music as her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) sweet
monosyllables.

<p/>The Baroness's fat horses were accustomed to short journeys, easy paces,
and plenty of feeding; so that, ill as Harry Warrington was mounted, he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>)
could, without much difficulty, keep pace with his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) elderly kinswoman. At
two o’clock they baited for a couple of hours for dinner. Mr. Warrington
paid the landlord generously. What price could be too great for the
pleasure which he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) enjoyed in being near his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) adored Maria, and having the
blissful chance of a conversation with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>), scarce interrupted by the
soft breathing of Madame de Bernstein, who, after a comfortable meal,
indulged in an agreeable half-hour's slumber? In voices soft and low,
Maria and her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) young gentleman talked over and over again those delicious
nonsenses which people in Harry's condition never tire of hearing and
uttering.

<p/>They were going to a crowded watering-place, where all sorts of beauty
and fashion would be assembled; timid Maria was certain that amongst the
young beauties, Harry would discover some, whose charms were far more
worthy to occupy his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) attention, than any her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) homely face and figure
could boast of. By all the gods, Harry vowed that Venus herself could
not tempt him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) from her (<font color='blue'><b>Venus</b></font>) side. It was he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) who for his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) part had occasion to
fear. When the young men of fashion beheld his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) peerless Maria they would
crowd round her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) car; they would cause her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) to forget the rough and humble
American lad who knew nothing of fashion or wit, who had only a faithful
heart at her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) service.

<p/>Maria smiles, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) casts her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) eyes to heaven, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) vows that Harry knows
nothing of the truth and fidelity of women; it is his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) sex, on the
contrary, which proverbially is faithless, and which delights to play
with poor female hearts. A scuffle ensues; a clatter is heard among the
knives and forks of the dessert; a glass tumbles over and breaks. An
<div class="bookquote">``Oh!''  (<font color='red'><b>Maria/Lady Maria/Lady Maria Esmond</b></font>)</div>escapes from the innocent lips of Maria, The disturbance has
been caused by the broad cuff of Mr. Warrington's coat, which has been
stretched across the table to seize Lady Maria's hand, and has upset the
wine-glass in so doing. Surely nothing could be more natural, or indeed
necessary, than that Harry, upon hearing his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) sex's honour impeached,
should seize upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) fair accuser's hand, and vow eternal fidelity upon
those charming fingers?

<p/>What a part they play, or used to play, in love-making, those hands! How
quaintly they are squeezed at that period of life! How they are pushed
into conversation! what absurd vows and protests are palmed off by their
aid! What good can there be in pulling and pressing a thumb and four
fingers? I fancy I see Alexis laugh, who is haply reading this page by
the side of Araminta. To talk about thumbs indeed!... Maria looks round,
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) part, to see if Madame Bernstein has been awakened by the crash
of glass; but the old lady slumbers quite calmly in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) arm-chair, so
her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) niece thinks there can be no harm in yielding to Harry's gentle
pressure.

<p/>The horses are put to: Paradise is over--at least until the next
occasion. When my landlord enters with the bill, Harry is standing quite
at a distance from his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) cousin, looking from the window at the cavalcade
gathering below. Madame Bernstein wakes up from her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) slumber, smiling and
quite unconscious. With what profound care and reverential politeness
Mr. Warrington hands his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) aunt to her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) carriage! how demure and simple
looks Lady Maria as she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) follows! Away go the carriages, in the midst
of a profoundly bowing landlord and waiters; of country-folks gathered
round the blazing inn-sign; of shopmen gazing from their homely
little doors; of boys and market-folks under the colonnade of the
old town-hall; of loungers along the gabled street. <div class="bookquote">``It is the famous
Baroness Bernstein. That is she (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>), the old lady in the capuchin. It is
the rich young American who is just come from Virginia, and is worth
millions and millions. Well, sure, he (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) might have a better horse.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The
cavalcade disappears, and the little town lapses into its usual quiet.
The landlord goes back to his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) friends at the club, to tell how the great
folks are going to sleep at The Bush, at Farnham, to-night.

<p/>The inn dinner had been plentiful, and all the three guests of the inn
had done justice to the good cheer. Harry had the appetite natural to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) period of life. Maria and her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) aunt were also not indifferent to
a good dinner: Madame Bernstein had had a comfortable nap after hers,
which had no doubt helped her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) to bear all the good things of the
meal--the meat pies, and the fruit pies, and the strong ale, and the
heady port wine. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) reclined at ease on her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) seat of the landau, and
looked back affably, and smiled at Harry and exchanged a little talk
with him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) rode by the carriage side. But what ailed the beloved
being who sate with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) back to the horses? Her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) complexion, which was
exceedingly fair, was further ornamented with a pair of red cheeks,
which Harry took to be natural roses. -LRB-You see, madam, that your
surmises regarding the Lady Maria's conduct with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) cousin are
quite wrong and uncharitable, and that the timid lad had made no such
experiments as you suppose, in order to ascertain whether the roses were
real or artificial. A kiss, indeed! I blush to think you should imagine
that the present writer could indicate anything so shocking!-RRB- Maria's
bright red cheeks, I say still, continued to blush as it seemed with
a strange metallic bloom: but the rest of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) face, which had used to
rival the lily in whiteness, became of a jonquil colour. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) eyes stared
round with a ghastly expression. Harry was alarmed at the agony depicted
in the charmer's countenance; which not only exhibited pain, but was
exceedingly unbecoming. Madame Bernstein also at length remarked
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) niece's indisposition, and asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) if sitting backwards in the
carriage made her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) ill, which poor Maria confessed to be the fact. On
this, the elder lady was forced to make room for her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) niece on her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) own
side, and, in the course of the drive to Farnham, uttered many gruff,
disagreeable, sarcastic remarks to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) fellow-traveller, indicating her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
great displeasure that Maria should be so impertinent as to be ill on
the first day of a journey.

<p/>When they reached the Bush Inn at Farnham, under which name a famous
inn has stood in Farnham town for these three hundred years--the dear
invalid retired with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) maid to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) bedroom: scarcely glancing a
piteous look at Harry as she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) retreated, and leaving the lad's mind in a
strange confusion of dismay and sympathy. Those yellow, yellow cheeks,
those livid wrinkled eyelids, that ghastly red--how ill his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) blessed
Maria looked! And not only how ill, but how--away, horrible thought,
unmanly suspicion! He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) tried to shut the idea out from his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) mind. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had
little appetite for supper, though the jolly Baroness partook of that
repast as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) had had no dinner; and certainly as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) had no
sympathy with her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) invalid niece.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) sent her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) major-domo to see if Lady Maria would have anything from
the table. The servant brought back word that her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) ladyship was still
very unwell, and declined any refreshment.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) intends to be well to-morrow morning,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bernstein/Madame de Bernstein/Madame Bernstein</b></font>)</div>cried Madame
Bernstein, rapping her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) little hand on the table. <div class="bookquote">``I hate people to be
ill in an inn, or on a journey. Will you play piquet with me, Harry?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry was happy to be able to play piquet with his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) aunt. <div class="bookquote">``That absurd
Maria!''  (<font color='red'><b>Bernstein/Madame de Bernstein/Madame Bernstein</b></font>)</div>says Madame Bernstein, drinking from a great glass of negus,
<div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) takes liberties with herself. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) never had a good constitution.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) is forty-one years old. All her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) upper teeth are false, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) can't
eat with them. Thank Heaven, I have still got every tooth in my head.
How clumsily you deal, child!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Bernstein/Madame de Bernstein/Madame Bernstein</b></font>)</div><p/>Deal clumsily indeed! Had a dentist been extracting Harry's own grinders
at that moment, would he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) have been expected to mind his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) cards and deal
them neatly? When a man is laid on the rack at the Inquisition, is it
natural that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) should smile and speak politely and coherently to the
grave, quiet Inquisitor? Beyond that little question regarding the
cards, Harry's Inquisitor did not show the smallest disturbance. Her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>)
face indicated neither surprise, nor triumph, nor cruelty. Madame
Bernstein did not give one more stab to her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) niece that night: but she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>)
played at cards, and prattled with Harry, indulging in her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) favourite
talk about old times, and parting from him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) with great cordiality and
good-humour. Very likely he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) did not heed her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) stories. Very likely other
thoughts occupied his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) mind. Maria is forty-one years old, Maria has
false --. Oh, horrible, horrible! Has she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) a false eye? Has she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) false
hair? Has she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) a wooden leg? I envy not that boy's dreams that night.

<p/>Madame Bernstein, in the morning, said she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) had slept as sound as a top.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) had no remorse, that was clear. -LRB-Some folks are happy and easy in
mind when their victim is stabbed and done for.-RRB- Lady Maria made her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>)
appearance at the breakfast-table, too. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) ladyship's indisposition was
fortunately over: her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) aunt congratulated her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) affectionately on her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) good
looks. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) sate down to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) breakfast. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) looked appealingly in Harry's
face. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) remarked, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) usual brilliancy and originality, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
was very glad her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) ladyship was better. Why, at the tone of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) voice,
did she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) start, and again gaze at him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) with frightened eyes? There sate
the Chief Inquisitor, smiling, perfectly calm, eating ham and muffins.
O poor writhing, rack-rent victim! O stony Inquisitor! O Baroness
Bernstein! It was cruel! cruel!

<p/>Round about Farnham the hops were gloriously green in the sunshine, and
the carriages drove through the richest, most beautiful country. Maria
insisted upon taking her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) old seat. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) thanked her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) dear aunt. It
would not in the least incommode her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) now. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) gazed, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) had done
yesterday, in the face of the young knight riding by the carriage side.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) looked for those answering signals which used to be lighted up in
yonder two windows, and told that love was burning within. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) smiled
gently at him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>), to which token of regard he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) tried to answer with a sickly
grin of recognition. Miserable youth! Those were not false teeth he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) saw
when she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) smiled. He (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) thought they were, and they tore and lacerated him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>).

<p/>And so the day sped on--sunshiny and brilliant overhead, but all over
clouds for Harry and Maria. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) saw nothing: he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) thought of Virginia: he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
remembered how he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had been in love with Parson Broadbent's daughter at
Jamestown, and how quickly that business had ended. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) longed vaguely to
be at home again. A plague on all these cold-hearted English relations!
Did they not all mean to trick him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)? Were they not all scheming against
him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)? Had not that confounded Will cheated him (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) about the horse?

<p/>At this very juncture, Maria gave a scream so loud and shrill that
Madame Bernstein woke, that the coachman pulled his (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>) horses up, and the
footman beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>) sprang down from his (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>) box in a panic.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let me out! let me out!''  (<font color='red'><b>Maria/Lady Maria/Lady Maria Esmond</b></font>)</div>screamed Maria. <div class="bookquote">``Let me go to him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)! let me go
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What is it?''  (<font color='red'><b>the Baroness</b></font>)</div>asked the Baroness.

<p/>It was that Will's horse had come down on his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) knees and nose, had sent
his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) rider over his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) head, and Mr. Harry, who ought to have known better,
was lying on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) own face quite motionless.

<p/>Gumbo, who had been dallying with the maids of the second carriage,
clattered up, and mingled his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) howls with Lady Maria's lamentations.
Madame Bernstein descended from her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) landau, and came slowly up,
trembling a good deal.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) is dead--he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) is dead!''  (<font color='red'><b>Maria/Lady Maria/Lady Maria Esmond</b></font>)</div>sobbed Maria.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't be a goose, Maria!''  (<font color='red'><b>aunt</b></font>)</div>her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) aunt said. <div class="bookquote">``Ring at that gate, some one!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Will's horse had gathered himself up and stood perfectly quiet after his (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>)
feat: but his (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>) late rider gave not the slightest sign of life.




<p/>CHAPTER XXI. Samaritans


<p/>Lest any tender-hearted reader should be in alarm for Mr. Harry
Warrington's safety, and fancy that his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) broken-kneed horse had carried
him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) altogether out of this life and history, let us set her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) mind easy at
the beginning of this chapter by assuring her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) that nothing very serious
has happened. How can we afford to kill off our heroes, when they are
scarcely out of their teens, and we have not reached the age of manhood
of the story? We are in mourning already for one of our Virginians, who
has come to grief in America; surely we cannot kill off the other in
England? No, no. Heroes are not despatched with such hurry and violence
unless there is a cogent reason for making away with them. Were a
gentleman to perish every time a horse came down with him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>), not only the
hero, but the author of this chronicle would have gone under ground,
whereas the former is but sprawling outside it, and will be brought to
life again as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) has been carried into the house where Madame de
Bernstein's servants have rung the bell.

<p/>And to convince you that at least this youngest of the Virginians is
still alive, here is an authentic copy of a letter from the lady into
whose house he (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>) was taken after his (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>) fall from Mr. Will's brute of a
broken-kneed horse, and in whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) appears to have found a kind friend:


<p/>``TO MRS. ESMOND WARRINGTON, OF CASTLEWOOD

<p/>``At her (<font color='blue'><b>ESMOND</b></font>) House at Richmond, in Virginia

<p/>``If Mrs. Esmond Warrington of Virginia can call to mind twenty-three
years ago, when Miss Rachel Esmond was at Kensington Boarding School,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) may perhaps remember Miss Molly Benson, her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) class-mate, who has
forgotten all the little quarrels which they used to have together -LRB-in
which Miss Molly was very often in the wrong-RRB-, and only remembers
the generous, high-spirited, sprightly, Miss Esmond, the Princess
Pocahontas, to whom so many of our school-fellows paid court.

<p/>``Dear madam! I cannot forget that you were dear Rachel once upon a time,
as I was your dearest Molly. Though we parted not very good friends when
you went home to Virginia, yet you know how fond we once were. I
still, Rachel, have the gold etui your papa gave me when he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) came to our
speech-day at Kensington, and we two performed the quarrel of Brutus
and Cassius out of Shakspeare; and `twas only yesterday morning I was
dreaming that we were both called up to say our lesson before the awful
Miss Hardwood, and that I did not know it, and that as usual Miss Rachel
Esmond went above me. How well remembered those old days are! How young
we grow as we think of them! I remember our walks and our exercises,
our good King and Queen as they walked in Kensington Gardens, and their
court following them, whilst we of Miss Hardwood's school curtseyed in
a row. I can tell still what we had for dinner on each day of the week,
and point to the place where your garden was, which was always so much
better kept than mine. So was Miss Esmond's chest of drawers a model of
neatness, whilst mine were in a sad condition. Do you remember how we
used to tell stories in the dormitory, and Madame Hibou, the French
governess, would come out of bed and interrupt us with her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) hooting? Have
you forgot the poor dancing-master, who told us he (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) had been waylaid by
assassins, but who was beaten, it appears, by my lord your brother's
footmen? My dear, your cousin, the Lady Maria Esmond -LRB-her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) papa was, I
think, but Viscount Castlewood in those times-RRB-, has just been on a visit
to this house, where you may be sure I did not recall those sad times to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) remembrance, about which I am now chattering to Mrs. Esmond.

<p/>``Her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) ladyship has been staying here, and another relative of yours, the
Baroness of Bernstein, and the two ladies are both gone on to Tunbridge
Wells; but another and dearer relative still remains in my house, and
is sound asleep, I trust, in the very next room, and the name of this
gentleman is Mr. Henry Esmond Warrington. Now, do you understand how you
come to hear from an old friend? Do not be alarmed, dear madam! I know
you are thinking at this moment, `My boy is ill. That is why Miss Molly
Benson writes to me.' No, my dear; Mr. Warrington was ill yesterday, but
to-day he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) is very comfortable; and our doctor, who is no less a person
than my dear husband, Colonel Lambert, has blooded him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>), has set his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>)
shoulder, which was dislocated, and pronounces that in two days more Mr.
Warrington will be quite ready to take the road.

<p/>``I fear I and my girls are sorry that he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) is so soon to be well.
Yesterday evening, as we were at tea, there came a great ringing at our
gate, which disturbed us all, as the bell very seldom sounds in this
quiet place, unless a passing beggar pulls it for charity; and the
servants, running out, returned with the news, that a young gentleman,
who had a fall from his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) horse, was lying lifeless on the road,
surrounded by the friends in whose company he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was travelling. At this,
my Colonel -LRB-who is sure the most Samaritan of men!-RRB- hastens away, to see
how he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) can serve the fallen traveller, and presently, with the aid of
the servants, and followed by two ladies, brings into the house such
a pale, lifeless, beautiful, young man! Ah, my dear, how I rejoice to
think that your child has found shelter and succour under my roof! that
my husband has saved him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) from pain and fever, and has been the means of
restoring him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) to you and health! We shall be friends again now, shall we
not? I was very ill last year, and `twas even thought I should die. Do
you know, that I often thought of you then, and how you had parted from
me in anger so many years ago? I began then a foolish note to you, which
I was too sick to finish, to tell you that if I went the way appointed
for us all, I should wish to leave the world in charity with every
single being I had known in it.

<p/>``Your cousin, the Right Honourable Lady Maria Esmond, showed a great
deal of maternal tenderness and concern for her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) young kinsman after his (<font color='blue'><b>kinsman</b></font>)
accident. I am sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) hath a kind heart. The Baroness de Bernstein,
who is of an advanced age, could not be expected to feel so keenly as
we young people; but was, nevertheless, very much moved and interested
until Mr. Warrington was restored to consciousness, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) said she (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>)
was anxious to get on towards Tunbridge, whither she (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) was bound, and
was afraid of all things to lie in a place where there was no doctor at
hand. My Aesculapius laughingly said, he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) would not offer to attend upon
a lady of quality, though he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) would answer for his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) young patient.
Indeed, the Colonel, during his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) campaigns, has had plenty of practice in
accidents of this nature, and I am certain, were we to call in all
the faculty for twenty miles round, Mr. Warrington could get no better
treatment. So, leaving the young gentleman to the care of me and my
daughters, the Baroness and her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) ladyship took their leave of us, the
latter very loth to go. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) is well enough, my Colonel will ride
with him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) as far as Westerham, but on his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) own horses, where an old
army-comrade of Mr. Lambert's resides. And, as this letter will not take
the post for Falmouth until, by God's blessing, your son is well and
perfectly restored, you need be under no sort of alarm for him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) whilst
under the roof of, madam, your affectionate, humble servant, MARY
LAMBERT.

<p/>``P.S. Thursday.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am glad to hear -LRB-Mr. Warrington's coloured gentleman hath informed
our people of the gratifying circumstance-RRB- that Providence hath blessed
Mrs. Esmond with such vast wealth, and with an heir so likely to do
credit to it. Our present means are amply sufficient, but will be small
when divided amongst our survivors. Ah, dear madam! I have heard of
your calamity of last year. Though the Colonel and I have reared many
children -LRB-five-RRB-, we have lost two, and a mother's heart can feel for
yours! I own to you, mine yearned to your boy to-day, when -LRB-in a manner
inexpressibly affecting to me and Mr. Lambert-RRB- he (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) mentioned his (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) dear
brother. `Tis impossible to see your son, and not to love and regard
him (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>). I am thankful that it has been our lot to succour him (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>)
trouble, and that in receiving the stranger within our gates we should
be giving hospitality to the son of an old friend.''


 (<font color='red'><b>some men</b></font>)</div><p/>Nature has written a letter of credit upon some men's faces, which is
honoured almost wherever presented. Harry Warrington's countenance was
so stamped in his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) youth. His (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) eyes were so bright, his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) cheek so red and
healthy, his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) look so frank and open, that almost all who beheld him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>),
nay, even those who cheated him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>), trusted him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>). Nevertheless, as we have
hinted, the lad was by no means the artless stripling he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) seemed to be.
He (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) was knowing enough with all his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) blushing cheeks; perhaps more wily
and wary than he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) grew to be in after-age. Sure, a shrewd and generous
man -LRB-who has led an honest life and has no secret blushes for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
conscience-RRB- grows simpler as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) grows older; arrives at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sum of
right by more rapid processes of calculation; learns to eliminate false
arguments more readily, and hits the mark of truth with less previous
trouble of aiming, and disturbance of mind. Or is it only a senile
delusion, that some of our vanities are cured with our growing years,
and that we become more just in our perceptions of our own and our
neighbour's shortcomings? ... I would humbly suggest that young people,
though they look prettier, have larger eyes, and not near so many
wrinkles about their eyelids, are often as artful as some of their
elders. What little monsters of cunning your frank schoolboys are!
How they cheat mamma! how they hoodwink papa! how they humbug the
housekeeper! how they cringe to the big boy for whom they fag at school!
what a long lie and five years' hypocrisy and flattery is their conduct
towards Dr. Birch! And the little boys' sisters? Are they any better,
and is it only after they come out in the world that the little darlings
learn a trick or two?

<p/>You may see, by the above letter of Mrs. Lambert, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>), like all
good women -LRB-and, indeed, almost all bad women-RRB-, was a sentimental
person; and, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) looked at Harry Warrington laid in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) best bed,
after the Colonel had bled him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) and clapped in his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) shoulder, as holding
by her (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) husband's hand she (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) beheld the lad in a sweet slumber, murmuring a
faint inarticulate word or two in his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) sleep, a faint blush quivering on
his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) cheek, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) owned he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) was a pretty lad indeed, and confessed with
a sort of compunction that neither of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) two boys--Jack who was
at Oxford, and Charles who was just gone back to school after the
Bartlemytide holidays--was half so handsome as the Virginian. What a
good figure the boy had! and when papa bled him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>), his (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) arm was as white as
any lady's!

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, as you say, Jack might have been as handsome but for the
small-pox: and as for Charley--''  (<font color='red'><b>the Colonel</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Always took after his (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) papa, my dear
Molly,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Colonel</b></font>)</div>said the Colonel, looking at his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) own honest face in a little
looking-glass with a cut border and a japanned frame, by which the chief
guests of the worthy gentleman and lady had surveyed their patches and
powder, or shaved their hospitable beards.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Did I say so, my love?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Lambert/Lambert</b></font>)</div>whispered Mrs. Lambert, looking rather scared.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No; but you thought so, Mrs. Lambert.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How can you tell one's thoughts so, Martin?''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>asks the lady.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Because I am a conjurer, and because you tell them yourself, my dear,''
 (<font color='red'><b>husband</b></font>)</div>answered her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) husband. <div class="bookquote">``Don't be frightened: he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) won't wake after that
draught I gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>). Because you never see a young fellow but you are
comparing him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) with your own. Because you never hear of one but you are
thinking which of our girls he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) shall fall in love with and marry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't be foolish, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>says the lady, putting a hand up to the
Colonel's lips. They have softly trodden out of their guest's bedchamber
by this time, and are in the adjoining dressing-closet, a snug little
wainscoted room looking over gardens, with India curtains, more Japan
chests and cabinets, a treasure of china, and a most refreshing odour of
fresh lavender.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You can't deny it, Mrs. Lambert,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Colonel</b></font>)</div>the Colonel resumes; <div class="bookquote">``as you were
looking at the young gentleman just now, you were thinking to yourself
which of my girls will he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) marry? Shall it be Theo, or shall it be
Hester? And then you thought of Lucy who was at boarding-school.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Colonel</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There is no keeping anything from you, Martin Lambert,''  (<font color='red'><b>the wife</b></font>)</div>sighs the wife.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There is no keeping it out of your eyes, my dear. What is this burning
desire all you women have for selling and marrying your daughters? We
men don't wish to part with `em. I am sure, for my part, I should not
like yonder young fellow half as well if I thought he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) intended to carry
one of my darlings away with him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sure, Martin, I have been so happy myself,''  (<font color='red'><b>the wife mother</b></font>)</div>says the fond wife and
mother, looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) husband with her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) very best eyes, <div class="bookquote">``that I must
wish my girls to do as I have done, and be happy, too!''

 (<font color='red'><b>husband</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then you think good husbands are common, Mrs. Lambert, and that you may
walk any day into the road before the house and find one shot out at the
gate like a sack of coals?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Wasn't it providential, sir, that this young gentleman should be thrown
over his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) horse's head at our very gate, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) should turn out to
be the son of my old schoolfellow and friend?''  (<font color='red'><b>the wife</b></font>)</div>asked the wife. <div class="bookquote">``There
is something more than accident in such cases, depend upon that, Mr.
Lambert!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And this was the stranger you saw in the candle three nights running, I
suppose?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And in the fire, too, sir; twice a coal jumped out close by Theo. You
may sneer, sir, but these things are not to be despised. Did I not see
you distinctly coming back from Minorca, and dream of you at the very
day and hour when you were wounded in Scotland?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How many times have you seen me wounded, when I had not a scratch, my
dear? How many times have you seen me ill when I had no sort of hurt?
You are always prophesying, and `twere very hard on you if you were not
sometimes right. Come! Let us leave our guest asleep comfortably, and go
down and give the girls their French lesson.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div><p/>So saying, the honest gentleman put his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) wife's arm under his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>), and they
descended together the broad oak staircase of the comfortable old
hall, round which hung the effigies of many foregone Lamberts, worthy
magistrates, soldiers, country gentlemen, as was the Colonel whose
acquaintance we have just made. The Colonel was a gentleman of pleasant,
waggish humour. The French lesson which he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) daughters conned
together was a scene out of Monsieur Moliere's comedy of <div class="bookquote">``Tartuffe,''
 (<font color='red'><b>daughters</b></font>)</div>and papa was pleased to be very facetious with Miss Theo, by calling
her (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) Madam, and by treating her (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) with a great deal of mock respect and
ceremony. The girls read together with their father a scene or two of
his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) favourite author -LRB-nor were they less modest in those days, though
their tongues were a little more free-RRB-, and papa was particularly arch
and funny as he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) read from Orgon's part in that celebrated play:


<p/><div class="bookquote">``ORGON.
Or sus, nous voila bien. J’ai, Mariane, en vous
Reconnu de tout temps un esprit assez doux,
Et de tout temps aussi vous m'avez ete chere.

<p/>MARIANE.
Je suis fort redevable a cet amour de pere.

<p/>ORGON.
Fort bien. Que dites-vous de Tartuffe notre hote?

<p/>MARIANE.
Qui? Moi?

<p/>ORGON.
Vous. Voyez bien comme vous repondrez.

<p/>MARIANE.
Helas! J’en dirai, moi, tout ce que vous voudrez!

<p/>-LRB-Mademoiselle Mariane laughs and blushes in spite of herself, whilst
reading this line.-RRB-

<p/>ORGON.
C’est parler sagement. Dites-moi donc, ma fille,
Qu’en toute sa personne un haut merite brille,
Qu’il touche votre coeur, et qu’il vous seroit doux
De le voir par men choix devenir votre epoux!''


 (<font color='red'><b>ORGON/Orgon</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Have we not read the scene prettily, Elmire?''  (<font color='red'><b>the Colonel</b></font>)</div>says the Colonel,
laughing, and turning round to his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) wife.

<p/>Elmira prodigiously admired Orgon's reading, and so did his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) daughters,
and almost everything besides which Mr. Lambert said or did. Canst thou,
O friendly reader, count upon the fidelity of an artless and tender
heart or two, and reckon among the blessings which Heaven hath bestowed
on thee the love of faithful women! Purify thine own heart, and try to
make it worthy theirs. On thy knees, on thy knees, give thanks for the
blessing awarded thee! All the prizes of life are nothing compared to
that one. All the rewards of ambition, wealth, pleasure, only vanity and
disappointment--grasped at greedily and fought for fiercely, and, over
and over again, found worthless by the weary winners. But love seems to
survive life, and to reach beyond it. I think we take it with us past
the grave. Do we not still give it to those who have left us? May we not
hope that they feel it for us, and that we shall leave it here in one or
two fond bosoms, when we also are gone?

<p/>And whence, or how, or why, pray, this sermon? You see I know more about
this Lambert family than you do to whom I am just presenting them:
as how should you who never heard of them before! You may not like my
friends; very few people do like strangers to whom they are presented
with an outrageous flourish of praises on the part of the introducer.
You say -LRB-quite naturally-RRB-, What? Is this all? Are these the people he (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>)
is so fond of? Why, the girl's not a beauty--the mother is good-natured,
and may have been good-looking once, but she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) has no trace of it
now--and, as for the father, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) is quite an ordinary man. Granted but
don't you acknowledge that the sight of an honest man, with an honest,
loving wife by his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) side, and surrounded by loving and obedient children,
presents something very sweet and affecting to you? If you are made
acquainted with such a person, and see the eager kindness of the fond
faces round about him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and that pleasant confidence and affection
which beams from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own, do you mean to say you are not touched and
gratified? If you happen to stay in such a man's house, and at morning
or evening see him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) children and domestics gathered together in a
certain name, do you not join humbly in the petitions of those servants,
and close them with a reverent Amen? That first night of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stay at
Oakhurst, Harry Warrington, who had had a sleeping potion, and was awake
sometimes rather feverish, thought he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) heard the Evening Hymn, and that
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) dearest brother George was singing it at home, in which delusion the
patient went off again to sleep.




<p/>CHAPTER XXII. In Hospital


<p/>Sinking into a sweet slumber, and lulled by those harmonious sounds, our
young patient passed a night of pleasant unconsciousness, and awoke in
the morning to find a summer sun streaming in at the window, and his (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>)
kind host and hostess smiling at his (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) bed-curtains. He (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) was ravenously
hungry, and his (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) doctor permitted him (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) straightway to partake of a mess of
chicken, which the doctor's wife told him (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) had been prepared by the hands
of one of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) daughters.

<p/>One of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) daughters? A faint image of a young person--of two young
persons--with red cheeks and black waving locks, smiling round his (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>)
couch, and suddenly departing thence, soon after he (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) had come to
himself, arose in the young man's mind. Then, then, there returned the
remembrance of a female--lovely, it is true, but more elderly--certainly
considerably older--and with f--. Oh, horror and remorse! He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) writhed
with anguish, as a certain recollection crossed him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). An immense gulf of
time gaped between him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and the past. How long was it since he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had heard
that those pearls were artificial,--that those golden locks were only
pinchbeck? A long, long time ago, when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was a boy, an innocent boy.
Now he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was a man,--quite an old man. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had been bled copiously; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had
a little fever; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had had nothing to eat for very many hours; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had a
sleeping-draught, and a long, deep slumber after.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is it, my dear child?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Lambert/Lambert</b></font>)</div>cries kind Mrs. Lambert, as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) started.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing, madam; a twinge in my shoulder,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lad</b></font>)</div>said the lad. <div class="bookquote">``I speak to my
host and hostess? Sure you have been very kind to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We are old friends, Mr. Warrington. My husband, Colonel Lambert,
knew your father, and I and your mamma were schoolgirls together at
Kensington. You were no stranger to us when your aunt and cousin told us
who you were.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Are they here?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>asked Harry, looking a little blank.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They must have lain at Tunbridge Wells last night. They sent a horseman
from Reigate yesterday for news of you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! I remember,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>says Harry, looking at his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) bandaged arm.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have made a good cure of you, Mr. Warrington. And now Mrs. Lambert
and the cook must take charge of you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay; Theo prepared the chicken and rice, Mr. Lambert,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>said the lady.
<div class="bookquote">``Will Mr. Warrington get up after he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) has had his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) breakfast? We will send
your valet to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If howling proves fidelity, your man must be a most fond, attached
creature,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lambert</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Lambert.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) let your baggage travel off after all in your aunt's carriage,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Lambert/Lambert</b></font>)</div>said
Mrs. Lambert. <div class="bookquote">``You must wear my husband's linen, which, I dare say, is
not so fine as yours.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pish, my dear! my shirts are good shirts enough for any Christian,''
 (<font color='red'><b>the Colonel</b></font>)</div>cries the Colonel.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They are Theo's and Hester's work,''  (<font color='red'><b>mamma</b></font>)</div>says mamma. At which her (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) husband
arches his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) eyebrows and looks at her (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``And Theo hath ripped and sewed
your sleeve to make it quite comfortable for your shoulder,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>the lady
added.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What beautiful roses!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>cries Harry, looking at a fine China vase full
of them that stood on the toilet-table, under the japan-framed glass.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My daughter Theo cut them this morning. Well, Mr. Lambert? She (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) did cut
them!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I suppose the Colonel was thinking that his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) wife introduced Theo too
much into the conversation, and trod on Mrs. Lambert's slipper, or
pulled her (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) robe, or otherwise nudged her (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) into a sense of propriety.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And I fancied I heard some one singing the Evening Hymn very sweetly
last night--or was it only a dream?''  (<font color='red'><b>the patient</b></font>)</div>asked the young patient.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Theo again, Mr. Warrington!''  (<font color='red'><b>the Colonel</b></font>)</div>said the Colonel, laughing. <div class="bookquote">``My servants
said your negro man began to sing it in the kitchen as if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was a
church organ.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Our people sing it at home, sir. My grandpapa used to love it very
much. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife's father was a great friend of good Bishop Ken, who wrote
it; and--and my dear brother used to love it too;''  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div>said the boy, his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>)
voice dropping.

<p/>It was then, I suppose, that Mrs. Lambert felt inclined to give the boy
a kiss. His (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) little accident, illness and recovery, the kindness of
the people round about him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), had softened Harry Warrington's heart, and
opened it to better influences than those which had been brought to bear
on it for some six weeks past. He (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) was breathing a purer air than that
tainted atmosphere of selfishness, and worldliness, and corruption, into
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) had been plunged since his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) arrival in England. Sometimes the
young man's fate, or choice, or weakness, leads him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) into the fellowship
of the giddy and vain; happy he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>), whose lot makes him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) acquainted with
the wiser company, whose lamps are trimmed, and whose pure hearts keep
modest watch.

<p/>The pleased matron left her (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>) young patient devouring Miss Theo's mess of
rice and chicken, and the Colonel seated by the lad's bedside. Gratitude
to his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) hospitable entertainers, and contentment after a comfortable
meal, caused in Mr. Warrington a very pleasant condition of mind and
body. He (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) was ready to talk now more freely than usually was his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) custom;
for, unless excited by a strong interest or emotion, the young man was
commonly taciturn and cautious in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) converse with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fellows, and was
by no means of an imaginative turn. Of books our youth had been but a
very remiss student, nor were his (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) remarks on such simple works as he (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>)
had read, very profound or valuable; but regarding dogs, horses, and
the ordinary business of life, he (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) was a far better critic; and, with any
person interested in such subjects, conversed on them freely enough.

<p/>Harry's host, who had considerable shrewdness, and experience of books,
and cattle, and men, was pretty soon able to take the measure of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
young guest in the talk which they now had together. It was now, for the
first time, the Virginian learned that Mrs. Lambert had been an early
friend of his (<font color='blue'><b>Virginian</b></font>) mother's, and that the Colonel's own father had served
with Harry's grandfather, Colonel Esmond, in the famous wars of Queen
Anne. He (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) found himself in a friend's country. He (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) was soon at ease with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) honest host, whose manners were quite simple and cordial, and who
looked and seemed perfectly a gentleman, though he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) wore a plain fustian
coat, and a waistcoat without a particle of lace.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My boys are both away,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>said Harry's host, <div class="bookquote">``or they would have shown
you the country when you got up, Mr. Warrington. Now you can only have
the company of my wife and her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) daughters. Mrs. Lambert hath told you
already about one of them, Theo, our eldest, who made your broth, who
cut your roses, and who mended your coat. She (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) is not such a wonder
as her (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) mother imagines her (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) to be: but little Theo is a smart little
housekeeper, and a very good and cheerful lass, though her (<font color='blue'><b>lass</b></font>) father says
it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is very kind of Miss Lambert to take so much care for me,''  (<font color='red'><b>the patient</b></font>)</div>says the
young patient.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) is no kinder to you than to any other mortal, and doth but her (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>)
duty.''  (<font color='red'><b>the Colonel</b></font>)</div>Here the Colonel smiled. <div class="bookquote">``I laugh at their mother for praising
our children,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``and I think I am as foolish about them myself.
The truth is, God hath given us very good and dutiful children, and I
see no reason why I should disguise my thankfulness for such a blessing.
You have never a sister, I think?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, sir, I am alone now,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>Mr. Warrington said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, truly, I ask your pardon for my thoughtlessness. Your man hath told
our people what befell last year. I served with Braddock in Scotland;
and hope he (<font color='blue'><b>Braddock</b></font>) mended before he (<font color='blue'><b>Braddock</b></font>) died. A wild fellow, sir, but there was
a fund of truth about the man, and no little kindness under his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) rough
swaggering manner. Your black fellow talks very freely about his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) master
and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) affairs. I suppose you permit him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) these freedoms as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) rescued
you--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Rescued me?''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>cries Mr. Warrington.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``From ever so many Indians on that very expedition. My Molly and I did
not know we were going to entertain so prodigiously wealthy a gentleman.
He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) saith that half Virginia belongs to you; but if the whole of North
America were yours, we could but give you our best.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Those negro boys, sir, lie like the father of all lies. They think it
is for our honour to represent us as ten times as rich as we are. My
mother has what would be a vast estate in England, and is a very good
one at home. We are as well off as most of our neighbours, sir, but no
better; and all our splendour is in Mr. Gumbo's foolish imagination. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gumbo</b></font>)
never rescued me from an Indian in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gumbo</b></font>) life, and would run away at the
sight of one, as my poor brother's boy did on that fatal day when he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
fell.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The bravest man will do so at unlucky times,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Colonel</b></font>)</div>said the Colonel. <div class="bookquote">``I
myself saw the best troops in the world run at Preston, before a ragged
mob of Highland savages.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That was because the Highlanders fought for a good cause, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you think,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>asks Harry's host, <div class="bookquote">``that the French Indians had the good
cause in the fight of last year?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The scoundrels! I would have the scalp of every murderous redskin among
`em!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>cried Harry, clenching his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) fist. <div class="bookquote">``They were robbing and invading
the British territories, too. But the Highlanders were fighting for
their king.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We, on our side, were fighting for our king; and we ended by winning
the battle,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Colonel</b></font>)</div>said the Colonel, laughing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>cried Harry; <div class="bookquote">``if his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) Royal Highness the Prince had not turned back
at Derby, your king and mine, now, would be his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) Majesty King James the
Third!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who made such a Tory of you, Mr. Warrington?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Lambert/Lambert</b></font>)</div>asked Lambert.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, sir, the Esmonds were always loyal!''  (<font color='red'><b>the youth</b></font>)</div>answered the youth. <div class="bookquote">``Had we
lived at home, and twenty years sooner, brother and I often and often
agreed that our heads would have been in danger. We certainly would have
staked them for the king's cause.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yours is better on your shoulders than on a pole at Temple Bar. I have
seen them there, and they don't look very pleasant, Mr. Warrington.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall take off my hat, and salute them, whenever I pass the gate,''
 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>cried the young man, <div class="bookquote">``if the king and the whole court are standing by!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I doubt whether your relative, my Lord Castlewood, is as staunch a
supporter of the king over the water,''  (<font color='red'><b>Colonel</b></font>)</div>said Colonel Lambert, smiling:
<div class="bookquote">``or your aunt, the Baroness of Bernstein, who left you in our charge.
Whatever her (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>) old partialities may have been, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>) has repented of them;
she (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>) has rallied to our side, landed her (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>) nephews in the Household,
and looks to find a suitable match for her (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>) nieces. If you have Tory
opinions, Mr. Warrington, take an old soldier's advice, and keep them to
yourself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Lambert/Lambert</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, sir, I do not think that you will betray me!''  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div>said the boy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not I, but others might. You did not talk in this way at Castlewood? I
mean the old Castlewood which you have just come from.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I might be safe amongst my own kinsmen, surely, sir!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>cried Harry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Doubtless. I would not say no. But a man's own kinsmen can play him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
slippery tricks at times, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) finds himself none the better for
trusting them. I mean no offence to you or any of your family; but
lacqueys have ears as well as their masters, and they carry about all
sorts of stories. For instance, your black fellow is ready to tell all
he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) knows about you, and a great deal more besides, as it would appear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hath he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) told about the broken-kneed horse?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>cried out Harry, turning
very red.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``To say truth, my groom seemed to know something of the story, and said
it was a shame a gentleman should sell another such a brute; let alone
a cousin. I am not here to play the Mentor to you, or to carry about
servants' tittle-tattle. When you have seen more of your cousins, you
will form your own opinion of them; meanwhile, take an old soldier's
advice, I say again, and be cautious with whom you deal, and what you
say.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lambert</b></font>)</div><p/>Very soon after this little colloquy, Mr. Lambert's guest rose, with the
assistance of Gumbo, his (<font color='blue'><b>guest</b></font>) valet, to whom he (<font color='blue'><b>guest</b></font>), for the hundredth time at
least, promised a sound caning if ever he (<font color='blue'><b>guest</b></font>) should hear that Gumbo had
ventured to talk about his (<font color='blue'><b>guest</b></font>) affairs again in the servants'-hall,--which
prohibition Gumbo solemnly vowed and declared he (<font color='blue'><b>guest</b></font>) would for ever obey;
but I dare say he (<font color='blue'><b>guest</b></font>) was chattering the whole of the Castlewood secrets
to his (<font color='blue'><b>guest</b></font>) new friends of Colonel Lambert's kitchen; for Harry's hostess
certainly heard a number of stories concerning him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) which she (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>) could
not prevent her (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>) housekeeper from telling; though of course I would not
accuse that worthy lady, or any of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) sex or ours, of undue curiosity
regarding their neighbours' affairs. But how can you prevent servants
talking, or listening when the faithful attached creatures talk to you?

<p/>Mr. Lambert's house stood on the outskirts of the little town of
Oakhurst, which, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) but travels in the right direction, the patient
reader will find on the road between Farnham and Reigate,--and Madame
Bernstein's servants naturally pulled at the first bell at hand, when
the young Virginian met with his (<font color='blue'><b>Virginian</b></font>) mishap. A few hundred yards farther,
was the long street of the little old town, where hospitality might have
been found under the great swinging ensigns of a couple of tuns, and
medical relief was to be had, as a blazing gilt pestle and mortar
indicated. But what surgeon could have ministered more cleverly to
a patient than Harry's host, who tended him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) without a fee, or what
Boniface could make him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) more comfortably welcome?

<p/>Two tall gates, each surmounted by a couple of heraldic monsters, led
from the highroad up to a neat, broad stone terrace, whereon stood
Oakhurst House; a square brick building, with windows faced with stone,
and many high chimneys, and a tall roof surmounted by a fair balustrade.
Behind the house stretched a large garden, where there was plenty of
room for cabbages as well as roses to grow; and before the mansion,
separated from it by the highroad, was a field of many acres, where the
Colonel's cows and horses were at grass. Over the centre window was a
carved shield supported by the same monsters who pranced or ramped upon
the entrance-gates; and a coronet over the shield. The fact is, that the
house had been originally the jointure-house of Oakhurst Castle, which
stood hard by,--its chimneys and turrets appearing over the surrounding
woods, now bronzed with the darkest foliage of summer. Mr. Lambert's
was the greatest house in Oakhurst town; but the Castle was of
more importance than all the town put together. The Castle and the
jointure-house had been friends of many years' date. Their fathers had
fought side by side in Queen Anne's wars. There were two small pieces
of ordnance on the terrace of the jointure-house, and six before the
Castle, which had been taken out of the same privateer, which Mr.
Lambert and his (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) kinsman and commander, Lord Wrotham, had brought into
Harwich in one of their voyages home from Flanders with despatches from
the great Duke.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) toilet completed with Mr. Gumbo's aid, his (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) fair hair neatly dressed
by that artist, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) open ribboned sleeve and wounded shoulder
supported by a handkerchief which hung from his (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) neck, Harry Warrington
made his (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) way out of the sick-chamber, preceded by his (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) kind host, who
led him (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) first down a broad oak stair, round which hung many pikes and
muskets of ancient shape, and so into a square marble-paved room, from
which the living-rooms of the house branched off. There were more arms
in this hall-pikes and halberts of ancient date, pistols and jack-boots
of more than a century old, that had done service in Cromwell's wars,
a tattered French guidon which had been borne by a French gendarme at
Malplaquet, and a pair of cumbrous Highland broadswords, which, having
been carried as far as Derby, had been flung away on the fatal field of
Culloden. Here were breastplates and black morions of Oliver's troopers,
and portraits of stern warriors in buff jerkins and plain bands and
short hair. <div class="bookquote">``They fought against your grandfathers and King Charles, Mr.
Warrington,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>said Harry's host. <div class="bookquote">``I don't hide that. They rode to join
the Prince of Orange at Exeter. We were Whigs, young gentleman, and
something more. John Lambert, the Major-General, was a kinsman of our
house, and we were all more or less partial to short hair and long
sermons. You do not seem to like either?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>Indeed, Harry's face
manifested signs of anything but pleasure whilst he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) examined the
portraits of the Parliamentary heroes. <div class="bookquote">``Be not alarmed, we are very
good Churchmen now. My eldest son will be in orders ere long. He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) is now
travelling as governor to my Lord Wrotham's son in Italy, and as for our
women, they are all for the Church, and carry me with `em. Every woman
is a Tory at heart. Mr. Pope says a rake, but I think t'other is the
more charitable word. Come, let us go see them,''  (<font color='red'><b>Colonel</b></font>)</div>and, flinging open
the dark oak door, Colonel Lambert led his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) young guest into the parlour
where the ladies were assembled.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here is Miss Hester,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Colonel</b></font>)</div>said the Colonel, <div class="bookquote">``and this is Miss Theo, the
soup-maker, the tailoress, the harpsichord-player, and the songstress,
who set you to sleep last night. Make a curtsey to the gentleman, young
ladies! Oh, I forgot, and Theo is the mistress of the roses which you
admired a short while since in your bedroom. I think she (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) has kept some
of them in her (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) cheeks.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Colonel</b></font>)</div><p/>In fact, Miss Theo was making a profound curtsey and blushing
most modestly as her (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) papa spoke. I am not going to describe her (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>)
person,--though we shall see a great deal of her (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) in the course of this
history. She (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) was not a particular beauty. Harry Warrington was not over
head and ears in love with her (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) at an instant's warning, and faithless
to--to that other individual with whom, as we have seen, the youth had
lately been smitten. Miss Theo had kind eyes and a sweet voice; a ruddy
freckled cheek and a round white neck, on which, out of a little cap
such as misses wore in those times, fell rich curling clusters of dark
brown hair. She (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) was not a delicate or sentimental-looking person. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>)
arms, which were worn bare from the elbow like other ladies' arms in
those days, were very jolly and red. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) feet were not so miraculously
small but that you could see them without a telescope. There was nothing
waspish about her (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) waist. This young person was sixteen years of age, and
looked older. I don't know what call she (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) had to blush so when she (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) made
her (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) curtsey to the stranger. It was such a deep ceremonial curtsey as
you never see at present. She (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) sister both made these <div class="bookquote">``cheeses''
 (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div>in compliment to the new comer, and with much stately agility.

<p/>As Miss Theo rose up out of this salute, her (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) papa tapped her (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) under the
chin -LRB-which was of the double sort of chins-RRB-, and laughingly hummed out
the line which he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) had read the day. <div class="bookquote">``Eh bien! que dites-vous, ma fille,
de notre hote?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nonsense, Mr. Lambert!''  (<font color='red'><b>mamma</b></font>)</div>cries mamma.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nonsense is sometimes the best kind of sense in the world,''  (<font color='red'><b>Colonel</b></font>)</div>said
Colonel Lambert. His (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) guest looked puzzled.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you fond of nonsense?''  (<font color='red'><b>the Colonel</b></font>)</div>the Colonel continued to Harry, seeing by
the boy's face that the latter had no great love or comprehension of his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>)
favourite humour. <div class="bookquote">``We consume a vast deal of it in this house.
Rabelais is my favourite reading. My wife is all for Mr. Fielding and
Theophrastus. I think Theo prefers Tom Brown, and Mrs. Hetty here loves
Dean Swift.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Our papa is talking what he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) loves,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hetty/Miss Hetty/Lambert</b></font>)</div>says Miss Hetty.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And what is that, miss?''  (<font color='red'><b>the father</b></font>)</div>asks the father of his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) second daughter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sure, sir, you said yourself it was nonsense,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>answers the young lady,
with a saucy toss of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) head.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Which of them do you like best, Mr. Warrington?''  (<font color='red'><b>the Colonel</b></font>)</div>asked the honest
Colonel.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Which of whom, sir?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The Curate of Meudon, or the Dean of St. Patrick's, or honest Tom, or
Mr. Fielding?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And what were they, sir?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They! Why, they wrote books.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed, sir. I never heard of either one of `em,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>said Harry, hanging
down his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``I fear my book-learning was neglected at home, sir. My
brother had read every book that ever was wrote, I think. He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) could have
talked to you about `em for hours together.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Lambert/Lambert</b></font>)</div><p/>With this little speech Mrs. Lambert's eyes turned to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) daughter, and
Miss Theo cast hers down and blushed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Never mind, honesty is better than books any day, Mr. Warrington!''
 (<font color='red'><b>the Colonel</b></font>)</div>cried the jolly Colonel. <div class="bookquote">``You may go through the world very honourably
without reading any of the books I have been talking of, and some of
them might give you more pleasure than profit.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know more about horses and dogs than Greek and Latin, sir. We most of
us do in Virginia,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Warrington.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are like the Persians; you can ride and speak the truth.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Are the Prussians very good on horseback, sir? I hope I shall see their
king and a campaign or two, either with `em or against `em,''  (<font color='red'><b>Colonel</b></font>)</div>remarked
Colonel Lambert's guest. Why did Miss Theo look at her (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) mother, and why
did that good woman's face assume a sad expression?

<p/>Why? Because young lasses are bred in humdrum country towns, do you
suppose they never indulge in romances? Because they are modest and have
never quitted mother's apron, do you suppose they have no thoughts of
their own? What happens in spite of all those precautions which the
King and Queen take for their darling princess, those dragons, and
that impenetrable forest, and that castle of steel? The fairy prince
penetrates the impenetrable forest, finds the weak point in the dragon's
scale armour, and gets the better of all the ogres who guard the castle
of steel. Away goes the princess to him (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) knew him (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) at once. Her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>)
bandboxes and portmanteaux are filled with her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) best clothes and all her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>)
jewels. She (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) has been ready ever so long.

<p/>That is in fairy tales, you understand--where the blessed hour and youth
always arrive, the ivory horn is blown at the castle gate; and far off
in her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) beauteous bower the princess hears it, and starts up, and knows
that there is the right champion. He (<font color='blue'><b>champion</b></font>) is always ready. Look! how the
giants' heads tumble off as, falchion in hand, he (<font color='blue'><b>champion</b></font>) gallops over the
bridge on his (<font color='blue'><b>champion</b></font>) white charger! How should that virgin, locked up in that
inaccessible fortress, where she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) has never seen any man that was not
eighty, or humpbacked, or her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) father, know that there were such beings
in the world as young men? I suppose there's an instinct. I suppose
there's a season. I never spoke for my part to a fairy princess, or
heard as much from any unenchanted or enchanting maiden. Ne’er a one
of them has ever whispered her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) pretty little secrets to me, or perhaps
confessed them to herself, her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) mamma, or her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) nearest and dearest
confidante. But they will fall in love. Their little hearts are
constantly throbbing at the window of expectancy on the lookout for the
champion. They are always hearing his (<font color='blue'><b>champion</b></font>) horn. They are for ever on the
tower looking out for the hero. Sister Ann, Sister Ann, do you see him (<font color='blue'><b>champion</b></font>)?
Surely `tis a knight with curling mustachios, a flashing scimitar, and a
suit of silver armour. Oh no! it is only a costermonger with his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) donkey
and a pannier of cabbage! Sister Ann, Sister Ann, what is that cloud of
dust? Oh, it is only a farmer's man driving a flock of pigs from market.
Sister Ann, Sister Ann, who is that splendid warrior advancing in
scarlet and gold? He (<font color='blue'><b>warrior</b></font>) nears the castle, he (<font color='blue'><b>warrior</b></font>) clears the drawbridge, he (<font color='blue'><b>warrior</b></font>)
lifts the ponderous hammer at the gate. Ah me, he (<font color='blue'><b>warrior</b></font>) knocks twice! `Tis
only the postman with a double letter from Northamptonshire! So it is we
make false starts in life. I don't believe there is any such thing known
as first love--not within man's or woman's memory. No male or female
remembers his (<font color='blue'><b>male</b></font>) or her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) first inclination any more than his (<font color='blue'><b>male</b></font>) or her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) own
christening. What? You fancy that your sweet mistress, your spotless
spinster, your blank maiden just out of the schoolroom, never cared
for any but you? And she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) tells you so? Oh, you idiot! When she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) was four
years old she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) had a tender feeling towards the Buttons who brought the
coals up to the nursery, or the little sweep at the crossing, or the
music-master, or never mind whom. She (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) had a secret longing towards
her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) brother's schoolfellow, or the third charity boy at church, and
if occasion had served, the comedy enacted with you had been performed
along with another. I do not mean to say that she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) confessed this amatory
sentiment, but that she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) had it. Lay down this page, and think how
many and many and many a time you were in love before you selected the
present Mrs. Jones as the partner of your name and affections!

<p/>So, from the way in which Theo held her (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) head down, and exchanged looks
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) mother, when poor unconscious Harry called the Persians the
Prussians, and talked of serving a campaign with them, I make no doubt
she (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) was feeling ashamed, and thinking within herself, <div class="bookquote">``Is this the hero
with whom my mamma and I have been in love for these twenty-four hours,
and whom we have endowed with every perfection? How beautiful, pale, and
graceful he (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) looked yesterday as he (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) lay on the ground! How his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) curls fell
over his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) face! How sad it was to see his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) poor white arm, and the blood
trickling from it when papa bled him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>)! And now he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) is well and amongst us,
he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) is handsome certainly, but oh, is it possible he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) is--he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) is stupid?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) lighted the lamp and looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), did Psyche find Cupid out;
and is that the meaning of the old allegory? The wings of love drop
off at this discovery. The fancy can no more soar and disport in skyey
regions, the beloved object ceases at once to be celestial, and remains
plodding on earth, entirely unromantic and substantial.




<p/>CHAPTER XXIII. Holidays


<p/>Mrs. Lambert's little day-dream was over. Miss Theo and her (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) mother were
obliged to confess in their hearts that their hero was but an ordinary
mortal. They uttered few words on the subject, but each knew the other's
thoughts as people who love each other do; and mamma, by an extra
tenderness and special caressing manner towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) daughter, sought to
console her (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) for her (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) disappointment. <div class="bookquote">``Never mind, my dear'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--the maternal
kiss whispered on the filial cheek--<div class="bookquote">``our hero has turned out to be but
an ordinary mortal, and none such is good enough for my Theo. Thou shalt
have a real husband ere long, if there be one in England. Why, I was
scarce fifteen when your father saw me at the Bury Assembly, and while I
was yet at school, I used to vow that I never would have any other
man. If Heaven gave me such a husband--the best man in the whole
kingdom--sure it will bless my child equally, who deserves a king if she (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>)
fancies him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Indeed, I am not sure that Mrs. Lambert--who, of course,
knew the age of the Prince of Wales, and was aware how handsome and good
a young prince he (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) was--did not expect that he (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) too would come riding by
her (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) gate, and perhaps tumble down from his (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) horse there, and be taken
into the house, and be cured, and cause his (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) royal grandpapa to give
Martin Lambert a regiment, and fall in love with Theo.

<p/>The Colonel for his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) part, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) second daughter, Miss Hetty, were on
the laughing, scornful, unbelieving side. Mamma was always match-making.
Indeed, Mrs. Lambert was much addicted to novels, and cried her (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) eyes out
over them with great assiduity. No coach ever passed the gate, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>)
expected a husband for her (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) girls would alight from it and ring the bell.
As for Miss Hetty, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) allowed her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) tongue to wag in a more than
usually saucy way: she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) made a hundred sly allusions to their guest. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
introduced Prussia and Persia into their conversation with abominable
pertness and frequency. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) asked whether the present King of Prussia
was called the Shaw or the Sophy, and how far it was from Ispahan to
Saxony, which his (<font color='blue'><b>Shaw</b></font>) Majesty was at present invading, and about which war
papa was so busy with his (<font color='blue'><b>Shaw</b></font>) maps and his (<font color='blue'><b>Shaw</b></font>) newspapers? She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) brought down the
Persian Tales from her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) mamma's closet, and laid them slily on the table
in the parlour where the family sate. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) would not marry a Persian
prince for her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) part; she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) would prefer a gentleman who might not have
more than one wife at a time. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) called our young Virginian Theo's
gentleman, Theo's prince. She (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) mamma if she (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) wished her (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>), Hetty,
to take the other visitor, the black prince, for herself? Indeed, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
rallied her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) sister and her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) mother unceasingly on their sentimentalities,
and would never stop until she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) had made them angry, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) would begin
to cry herself, and kiss them violently one after the other, and coax
them back into good-humour. Simple Harry Warrington, meanwhile, knew
nothing of all the jokes, the tears, quarrels, reconciliations, hymeneal
plans, and so forth, of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) was the innocent occasion. A hundred
allusions to the Prussians and Persians were shot at him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>), and those
Parthian arrows did not penetrate his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) hide at all. A Shaw? A Sophy?
Very likely he (<font color='blue'><b>Shaw</b></font>) thought a Sophy was a lady, and would have deemed it the
height of absurdity that a man with a great black beard should have
any such name. We fall into the midst of a quiet family: we drop like a
stone, say, into a pool,--we are perfectly compact and cool, and little
know the flutter and excitement we make there, disturbing the fish,
frightening the ducks, and agitating the whole surface of the water.
How should Harry know the effect which his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) sudden appearance produced in
this little, quiet, sentimental family? He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) thought quite well enough of
himself on many points, but was diffident as yet regarding women, being
of that age when young gentlemen require encouragement and to be brought
forward, and having been brought up at home in very modest and primitive
relations towards the other sex. So Miss Hetty's jokes played round the
lad, and he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) minded them no more than so many summer gnats. It was not
that he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) was stupid, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) certainly thought him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>): he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) was simple, too
much occupied with himself and his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) own honest affairs to think of
others. Why, what tragedies, comedies, interludes, intrigues, farces,
are going on under our noses in friends' drawing-rooms where we visit
every day, and we remain utterly ignorant, self-satisfied, and blind!
As these sisters sate and combed their flowing ringlets of nights, or
talked with each other in the great bed where, according to the fashion
of the day, they lay together, how should Harry know that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had so
great a share in their thoughts, jokes, conversation? Three days after
his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) arrival, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) new and hospitable friends were walking with him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) in my
Lord Wrotham's fine park, where they were free to wander; and here, on a
piece of water, they came to some swans, which the young ladies were
in the habit of feeding with bread. As the birds approached the young
women, Hetty said, with a queer look at her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) mother and sister, and
then a glance at her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) father, who stood by, honest, happy, in a red
waistcoat,--Hetty said: <div class="bookquote">``Mamma's swans are something like these, papa.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hetty/Miss Hetty/Lambert</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What swans, my dear?''  (<font color='red'><b>mamma</b></font>)</div>says mamma.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Something like, but not quite. They have shorter necks than these, and
are, scores of them, on our common,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hetty/Miss Hetty/Lambert</b></font>)</div>continues Miss Hetty. <div class="bookquote">``I saw Betty
plucking one in the kitchen this morning. We shall have it for dinner,
with apple-sauce and--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't be a little goose!''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Theo</b></font>)</div>says Miss Theo.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And sage and onions. Do you love swan, Mr. Warrington?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shot three last winter on our river,''  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>said the Virginian gentleman.
<div class="bookquote">``Ours are not such white birds as these--they eat very well, though.''
 (<font color='red'><b>The youth</b></font>)</div>The simple youth had not the slightest idea that he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) himself was an
allegory at that very time, and that Miss Hetty was narrating a fable
regarding him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>). In some exceedingly recondite Latin work I have read
that, long before Virginia was discovered, other folks were equally dull
of comprehension.

<p/>So it was a premature sentiment on the part of Miss Theo--that little
tender flutter of the bosom which we have acknowledged she (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) felt on first
beholding the Virginian, so handsome, pale, and bleeding. This was not
the great passion which she (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) knew her (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) heart could feel. Like the birds,
it had wakened and begun to sing at a false dawn. Hop back to thy perch,
and cover thy head with thy wing, thou tremulous little fluttering
creature! It is not yet light, and roosting is as yet better than
singing. Anon will come morning, and the whole sky will redden, and you
shall soar up into it and salute the sun with your music.

<p/>One little phrase, some three-and-thirty lines back, perhaps the fair
and suspicious reader has remarked: <div class="bookquote">``Three days after his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) arrival, Harry
was walking with,''  (<font color='red'><b>the reader</b></font>)</div>etc. etc.. If he (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) could walk--which it appeared he (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>)
could do perfectly well--what business had he (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) to be walking with anybody
but Lady Maria Esmond on the Pantiles, Tunbridge Wells? His (<font color='blue'><b>Wells</b></font>) shoulder
was set: his (<font color='blue'><b>Wells</b></font>) health was entirely restored: he (<font color='blue'><b>Wells</b></font>) had not even a change of
coats, as we have seen, and was obliged to the Colonel for his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) raiment.
Surely a young man in such a condition had no right to be lingering
on at Oakhurst, and was bound by every tie of duty and convenience,
by love, by relationship, by a gentle heart waiting for him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>), by the
washerwoman finally, to go to Tunbridge. Why did he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) stay behind, unless
he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) was in love with either of the young ladies -LRB-and we say he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) wasn't-RRB-?
Could it be that he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) did not want to go? Hath the gracious reader
understood the meaning of the mystic S with which the last chapter
commences, and in which the designer has feebly endeavoured to depict
the notorious Sinbad the Sailor, surmounted by that odious old man of
the sea? What if Harry Warrington should be that sailor, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) fate
that choking, deadening, inevitable old man? What if for two days past
he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) has felt those knees throttling him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) round the neck? if his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) fell
aunt's purpose is answered, and if his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) late love is killed as dead
by her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) poisonous communications as fair Rosamond was by her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) royal and
legitimate rival? Is Hero then lighting the lamp up, and getting ready
the supper, whilst Leander is sitting comfortably with some other party,
and never in the least thinking of taking to the water? Ever since
that coward's blow was struck in Lady Maria's back by her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) own relative,
surely kind hearts must pity her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) ladyship. I know she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) has faults--ay,
and wears false hair and false never mind what. But a woman in distress,
shall we not pity her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)--a lady of a certain age, are we going to laugh at
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) because of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) years? Between her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) old aunt and her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) unhappy delusion,
be sure my Lady Maria Esmond is having no very pleasant time of it at
Tunbridge Wells. There is no one to protect her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>). Madam Beatrix has her (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrix</b></font>)
all to herself. Lady Maria is poor, and hopes for money from her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) aunt.
Lady Maria has a secret or two which the old woman knows, and brandishes
over her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>). I for one am quite melted and grow soft-hearted as I think
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>). Imagine her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) alone, and a victim to that old woman! Paint to
yourself that antique Andromeda -LRB-if you please we will allow that rich
flowing head of hair to fall over her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) shoulders-RRB- chained to a rock
on Mount Ephraim, and given up to that dragon of a Baroness! Succour,
Perseus! Come quickly with thy winged feet and flashing falchion!
Perseus is not in the least hurry. The dragon has her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) will of Andromeda
for day after day.

<p/>Harry Warrington, who would not have allowed his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) dislocated and mended
shoulder to keep him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) from going out hunting, remained day after day
contentedly at Oakhurst, with each day finding the kindly folks who
welcomed him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) more to his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) liking. Perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) had never, since his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>)
grandfather's death, been in such good company. His (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) lot had lain amongst
fox-hunting Virginian squires, with whose society he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) had put up very
contentedly, riding their horses, living their lives, and sharing their
punch-bowls. The ladies of his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) own and mother's acquaintance were
very well bred, and decorous, and pious, no doubt, but somewhat
narrow-minded. It was but a little place, his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) home, with its pompous
ways, small etiquettes and punctilios, small flatteries, small
conversations and scandals. Until he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) had left the place, some time
after, he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) did not know how narrow and confined his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) life had been there.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) was free enough personally. He (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) had dogs and horses, and might shoot
and hunt for scores of miles round about: but the little lady-mother
domineered at home, and when there he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) had to submit to her (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) influence and
breathe her (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) air.

<p/>Here the lad found himself in the midst of a circle where everything
about him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) was incomparably gayer, brighter, and more free. He (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) was living
with a man and woman who had seen the world, though they lived retired
from it, who had both of them happened to enjoy from their earliest
times the use not only of good books, but of good company--those live
books, which are such pleasant and sometimes such profitable reading.
Society has this good at least: that it lessens our conceit, by teaching
us our insignificance, and making us acquainted with our betters. If you
are a young person who read this, depend upon it, sir or madam, there is
nothing more wholesome for you than to acknowledge and to associate with
your superiors. If I could, I would not have my son Thomas first Greek
and Latin prize boy, first oar, and cock of the school. Better for his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>)
soul's and body's welfare that he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) should have a good place, not the
first--a fair set of competitors round about him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>), and a good thrashing
now and then, with a hearty shake afterwards of the hand which
administered the beating. What honest man that can choose his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lot would
be a prince, let us say, and have all society walking backwards before
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), only obsequious household-gentlemen to talk to, and all mankind mum
except when your High Mightiness asks a question and gives permission
to speak? One of the great benefits which Harry Warrington received from
this family, before whose gate Fate had shot him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>), was to begin to learn
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) was a profoundly ignorant young fellow, and that there were many
people in the world far better than he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) knew himself to be. Arrogant
a little with some folks, in the company of his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) superiors he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) was
magnanimously docile. We have seen how faithfully he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) admired his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) brother
at home, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) friend, the gallant young Colonel of Mount Vernon: of
the gentlemen, his (<font color='blue'><b>Vernon</b></font>) kinsmen at Castlewood, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vernon</b></font>) had felt himself at least
the equal. In his (<font color='blue'><b>Vernon</b></font>) new acquaintance at Oakhurst he (<font color='blue'><b>Vernon</b></font>) found a man who had
read far more books than Harry could pretend to judge of, who had seen
the world and come unwounded out of it, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had out of the dangers
and battles which he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had confronted, and who had goodness and honesty
written on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) face and breathing from his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) lips, for which qualities our
brave lad had always an instinctive sympathy and predilection.

<p/>As for the women, they were the kindest, merriest, most agreeable he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had
as yet known. They were pleasanter than Parson Broadbent's black-eyed
daughter at home, whose laugh carried as far as a gun. They were quite
as well-bred as the Castlewood ladies, with the exception of Madam
Beatrix -LRB-who, indeed, was as grand as an empress on some occasions-RRB-.
But somehow, after a talk with Madam Beatrix, and vast amusement and
interest in her (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrix</b></font>) stories, the lad would come away as with a bitter taste
in his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) mouth, and fancy all the world wicked round about him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>). They were
not in the least squeamish; and laughed over pages of Mr. Fielding, and
cried over volumes of Mr. Richardson, containing jokes and incidents
which would make Mrs. Grundy's hair stand on end, yet their merry
prattle left no bitterness behind it: their tales about this neighbour
and that were droll, not malicious; the curtseys and salutations with
which the folks of the little neighbouring town received them, how
kindly and cheerful! their bounties how cordial! Of a truth it is good
to be with good people. How good Harry Warrington did not know at the
time, perhaps, or until subsequent experience showed him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) contrasts, or
caused him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) to feel remorse. Here was a tranquil, sunshiny day of a life
that was to be agitated and stormy--a happy hour or two to remember.
Not much happened during the happy hour or two. It was only sweet sleep,
pleasant waking, friendly welcome, serene pastime. The gates of the old
house seemed to shut the wicked world out somehow, and the inhabitants
within to be better, and purer, and kinder than other people. He (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) was
not in love; oh no! not the least, either with saucy Hetty or generous
Theodosia but when the time came for going away, he (<font color='blue'><b>Theodosia</b></font>) fastened on both
their hands, and felt an immense regard for them. He (<font color='blue'><b>Theodosia</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Theodosia</b></font>) should
like to know their brothers, and that they must be fine fellows; and as
for Mrs. Lambert, I believe she (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) was as sentimental at his (<font color='blue'><b>Theodosia</b></font>) departure as
if he (<font color='blue'><b>Theodosia</b></font>) had been the last volume of Clarissa Harlowe.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) is very kind and honest,''  (<font color='red'><b>Theo/Lady Theo</b></font>)</div>said Theo, gravely, as, looking from the
terrace, they saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Theodosia</b></font>) and their father and servants riding away on the
road to Westerham.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) stupid at all now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hetty/Miss Hetty/Lambert</b></font>)</div>said little Hetty; <div class="bookquote">``and, mamma, I
think, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) is very like a swan indeed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hetty/Miss Hetty/Lambert</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It felt just like one of the boys going to school,''  (<font color='red'><b>mamma</b></font>)</div>said mamma.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Just like it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Theo</b></font>)</div>said Theo, sadly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am glad he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) has got papa to ride with him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) to Westerham,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hetty/Miss Hetty/Lambert</b></font>)</div>resumed Miss
Hetty, <div class="bookquote">``and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) bought Farmer Briggs's horse. I don't like his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) going
to those Castlewood people. I am sure that Madame Bernstein is a wicked
old woman. I expected to see her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) ride away on her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) crooked stick.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hetty/Miss Hetty/Lambert</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hush, Hetty!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you think she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) would float if they tried her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) in the pond, as poor old
mother Hely did at Elmhurst? The other old woman seemed fond of him (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>)--I
mean the one with the fair tour. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) looked very melancholy when she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
went away; but Madame Bernstein whisked her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) off with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) crutch, and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
was obliged to go. I don't care, Theo. I know she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is a wicked woman.
You think everybody good, you do, because you never do anything wrong
yourself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My Theo is a good girl,''  (<font color='red'><b>the mother</b></font>)</div>says the mother, looking fondly at both her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
daughters.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then why do we call her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) a miserable sinner?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We are all so, my love,''  (<font color='red'><b>mamma</b></font>)</div>said mamma.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What, papa too? You know you don't think so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hester/Miss Hester/Miss Hester Lambert</b></font>)</div>cries Miss Hester. And to
allow this was almost more than Mrs. Lambert could afford.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What was that you told John to give to Mr. Warrington's black man?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Mamma owned, with some shamefacedness, it was a bottle of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) cordial
water and a cake which she (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) had bid Betty make. <div class="bookquote">``I feel quite like a
mother to him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>), my dears, I can't help owning it,--and you know both
our boys still like one of our cakes to take to school or college with
them.''




 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER XXIV. From Oakhurst to Tunbridge


<p/>Having her (<font color='blue'><b>Betty</b></font>) lily handkerchief in token of adieu to the departing
travellers, Mrs. Lambert and her (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) girls watched them pacing leisurely on
the first few hundred yards of their journey, and until such time as a
tree-clumped corner of the road hid them from the ladies' view. Behind
that clump of limes the good matron had many a time watched those she (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>)
loved best disappear. Husband departing to battle and danger, sons to
school, each after the other had gone on his (<font color='blue'><b>Husband</b></font>) way behind yonder green
trees, returning as it pleased Heaven's will at his (<font color='blue'><b>Husband</b></font>) good time, and
bringing pleasure and love back to the happy little family. Besides
their own instinctive nature -LRB-which to be sure aids wonderfully in the
matter-RRB-, the leisure and contemplation attendant upon their home life
serve to foster the tenderness and fidelity of our women. The men gone,
there is all day to think about them, and to-morrow and to-morrow--when
there certainly will be a letter--and so on. There is the vacant room
to go look at, where the boy slept last night, and the impression of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
carpet bag is still on the bed. There is his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) whip hung up in the hall,
and his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) fishing-rod and basket--mute memorials of the brief bygone
pleasures. At dinner there comes up that cherry-tart, half of which
our darling ate at two o’clock in spite of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) melancholy, and with a
choking little sister on each side of him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>). The evening prayer is said
without that young scholar's voice to utter the due responses. Midnight
and silence come, and the good mother lies wakeful, thinking how one of
the dear accustomed brood is away from the nest. Morn breaks, home and
holidays have passed away, and toil and labour have begun for him (<font color='blue'><b>scholar</b></font>). So
those rustling limes formed, as it were, a screen between the world and
our ladies of the house at Oakhurst. Kind-hearted Mrs. Lambert always
became silent and thoughtful, if by chance she (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) girls walked up
to the trees in the absence of the men of the family. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) said she (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) would
like to carve their names up on the grey silvered trunks, in the midst
of true-lovers' knots, as was then the kindly fashion; and Miss Theo,
who had an exceeding elegant turn that way, made some verses regarding
the trees, which her (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) delighted parent transmitted to a periodical of
those days.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now we are out of sight of the ladies,''  (<font color='red'><b>Colonel</b></font>)</div>says Colonel Lambert, giving a
parting salute with his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) hat, as the pair of gentlemen trotted past the
limes in question. <div class="bookquote">``I know my wife always watches at her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) window until we
are round this corner. I hope we shall have you seeing the trees and the
house again, Mr. Warrington; and the boys being at home, mayhap there
will be better sport for you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I never want to be happier, sir, than I have been,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>replied Mr.
Warrington; <div class="bookquote">``and I hope you will let me say, that I feel as if I am
leaving quite old friends behind me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The friend at whose house we shall sup to-night hath a son, who is
an old friend of our family, too; and my wife, who is an inveterate
marriage-monger, would have made a match between him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) and one of my
girls, but that the Colonel hath chosen to fall in love with somebody
else.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah!''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>sighed Mr. Warrington.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Other folks have done the same thing. There were brave fellows before
Agamemnon.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I beg your pardon, sir. Is the gentleman's name--Aga--? I did not
quite gather it,''  (<font color='red'><b>the traveller</b></font>)</div>meekly inquired the young traveller.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) name is James Wolfe,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Colonel</b></font>)</div>cried the Colonel, smiling. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Wolfe</b></font>) is a
young fellow still, or what we call so, being scarce thirty years old.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Wolfe</b></font>) is the youngest lieutenant-colonel in the army, unless, to be sure,
we except a few scores of our nobility, who take rank before us common
folk.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course of course!''  (<font color='red'><b>the Colonel</b></font>)</div>says the Colonel's young companion with true
colonial notions of aristocratic precedence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And I have seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Wolfe</b></font>) commanding captains, and very brave captains, who
were thirty years his (<font color='blue'><b>Wolfe</b></font>) seniors, and who had neither his (<font color='blue'><b>Wolfe</b></font>) merit nor his (<font color='blue'><b>Wolfe</b></font>)
good fortune. But, lucky as he (<font color='blue'><b>Wolfe</b></font>) hath been, no one envies his (<font color='blue'><b>Wolfe</b></font>) superiority,
for, indeed, most of us acknowledge that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wolfe</b></font>) is our superior. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wolfe</b></font>) is
beloved by every man of our old regiment and knows every one of them. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wolfe</b></font>)
is a good scholar as well as a consummate soldier, and a master of many
languages.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, sir!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>said Harry Warrington, with a sigh of great humility; <div class="bookquote">``I feel
that I have neglected my own youth sadly; and am come to England but an
ignoramus. Had my dear brother been alive, he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) would have represented our
name and our colony, too, better than I can do. George was a scholar;
George was a musician; George could talk with the most learned people
in our country, and I make no doubt would have held his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) own here. Do you
know, sir, I am glad to have come home, and to you especially, if but to
learn how ignorant I am.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you know that well, `tis a great gain already,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Colonel</b></font>)</div>said the Colonel,
with a smile.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``At home, especially of late, and since we lost my brother, I used to
think myself a mighty fine fellow, and have no doubt that the folks
round about flattered me. I am wiser now,--that is, I hope I am,--though
perhaps I am wrong, and only bragging again. But you see, sir, the
gentry in our colony don't know very much, except about dogs and horses,
and betting and games. I wish I knew more about books, and less about
them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay. Dogs and horses are very good books, too, in their way, and we may
read a deal of truth out of `em. Some men are not made to be scholars,
and may be very worthy citizens and gentlemen in spite of their
ignorance. What call have all of us to be especially learned or wise, or
to take a first place in the world? His (<font color='blue'><b>men</b></font>) Royal Highness is commander, and
Martin Lambert is colonel, and Jack Hunt, who rides behind yonder, was a
private soldier, and is now a very honest, worthy groom. So as we all
do our best in our station, it matters not much whether that be high
or low. Nay, how do we know what is high and what is low? and whether
Jack's currycomb, or my epaulets, or his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) Royal Highness's baton, may
not turn out to be pretty equal? When I began life, et militavi non
sine--never mind what--I dreamed of success and honour; now I think of
duty, and yonder folks, from whom we parted a few hours ago. Let us trot
on, else we shall not reach Westerham before nightfall.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Westerham the friends</b></font>)</div><p/>At Westerham the two friends were welcomed by their hosts, a stately
matron, an old soldier, whose recollections and services were of
five-and-forty years back, and the son of this gentleman and lady, the
Lieutenant-Colonel of Kingsley's regiment, that was then stationed at
Maidstone, whence the Colonel had come over on a brief visit to his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>)
parents. Harry looked with some curiosity at this officer, who, young
as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was, had seen so much service, and obtained a character so high.
There was little of the beautiful in his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) face. He (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) was very lean and very
pale; his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) hair was red, his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) nose and cheek-bones were high; but he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) had
a fine courtesy towards his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) elders, a cordial greeting towards his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>)
friends, and an animation in conversation which caused those who heard
him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) to forget, even to admire, his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) homely looks.

<p/>Mr. Warrington was going to Tunbridge? Their James would bear him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>)
company, the lady of the house said, and whispered something to Colonel
Lambert at supper, which occasioned smiles and a knowing wink or two
from that officer. He (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) called for wine, and toasted <div class="bookquote">``Miss Lowther.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``With
all my heart,''  (<font color='red'><b>Colonel</b></font>)</div>cried the enthusiastic Colonel James, and drained his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>)
glass to the very last drop. Mamma whispered her (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) friend how James and
the lady were going to make a match, and how she (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) came of the famous
Lowther family of the North.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) was the daughter of King Charlemagne,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Lambert/Lambert</b></font>)</div>cries Lambert, <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) is
not too good for James Wolfe, or for his (<font color='blue'><b>Wolfe</b></font>) mother's son.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Lambert/Lambert</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Lambert would not say so if he (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) knew her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>the Colonel</b></font>)</div>the young Colonel
declared.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, of course, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) is the priceless pearl, and you are nothing,''  (<font color='red'><b>mamma</b></font>)</div>cries
mamma. <div class="bookquote">``No. I am of Colonel Lambert's opinion; and, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) brought all
Cumberland to you for a jointure, I should say it was my James's due.
That is the way with `em, Mr. Warrington. We tend our children through
fevers, and measles, and whooping-cough, and small-pox; we send them to
the army and can't sleep at night for thinking; we break our hearts at
parting with `em, and have them at home only for a week or two in the
year, or maybe ten years, and, after all our care, there comes a lass
with a pair of bright eyes, and away goes our boy, and never cares a fig
for us afterwards.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And pray, my dear, how did you come to marry James's papa?''  (<font color='red'><b>Colonel</b></font>)</div>said
the elder Colonel Wolfe. <div class="bookquote">``And why didn't you stay at home with your
parents?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because James's papa was gouty, and wanted somebody to take care of
him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>), I suppose; not because I liked him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) a bit,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>answers the lady: and so
with much easy talk and kindness the evening passed away.

<p/>On the morrow, and with many expressions of kindness and friendship for
his (<font color='blue'><b>Wolfe</b></font>) late guest, Colonel Lambert gave over the young Virginian to Mr.
Wolfe's charge, and turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Wolfe</b></font>) horse's head homewards, while the two
gentlemen sped towards Tunbridge Wells. Wolfe was in a hurry to reach
the place, Harry Warrington was, perhaps, not quite so eager: nay, when
Lambert rode towards his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) own home, Harry's thoughts followed him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) with
a great deal of longing desire to the parlour at Oakhurst, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>)
had spent three days in happy calm. Mr. Wolfe agreed in all Harry's
enthusiastic praises of Mr. Lambert, and of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) wife, and of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>)
daughters, and of all that excellent family. <div class="bookquote">``To have such a good name,
and to live such a life as Colonel Lambert's,''  (<font color='red'><b>James Wolfe/Wolfe</b></font>)</div>said Wolfe, <div class="bookquote">``seem to me
now the height of human ambition.''

 (<font color='red'><b>James Wolfe/Wolfe</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And glory and honour?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>asked Warrington, <div class="bookquote">``are those nothing? and would
you give up the winning of them?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They were my dreams once,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Colonel</b></font>)</div>answered the Colonel, who had now different
ideas of happiness, <div class="bookquote">``and now my desires are much more tranquil. I have
followed arms ever since I was fourteen years of age. I have seen almost
every kind of duty connected with my calling. I know all the garrison
towns in this country, and have had the honour to serve wherever there
has been work to be done during the last ten years. I have done pretty
near the whole of a soldier's duty, except, indeed, the command of
an army, which can hardly be hoped for by one of my years; and now,
methinks, I would like quiet, books to read, a wife to love me, and some
children to dandle on my knee. I have imagined some such Elysium for
myself, Mr. Warrington. True love is better than glory; and a tranquil
fireside, with the woman of your heart seated by it, the greatest good
the gods can send to us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Colonel</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry imagined to himself the picture which his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) comrade called up. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
said <div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>in answer to the other's remark; but, no doubt, did not give
a very cheerful assent, for his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) companion observed upon the expression
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You say `Yes' as if a fireside and a sweetheart were not particularly
to your taste.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, look you, Colonel, there are other things which a young fellow
might like to enjoy. You have had sixteen years of the world: and I am
but a few months away from my mother's apron-strings. When I have seen
a campaign or two, or six, as you have: when I have distinguished myself
like Mr. Wolfe, and made the world talk of me, I then may think of
retiring from it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wolfe/Wolfe</b></font>)</div><p/>To these remarks, Mr. Wolfe, whose heart was full of a very different
matter, replied by breaking out in a further encomium of the joys of
marriage; and a special rhapsody upon the beauties and merits of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wolfe</b></font>)
mistress--a theme intensely interesting to himself, though not so,
possibly, to his (<font color='blue'><b>Wolfe</b></font>) hearer, whose views regarding a married life, if
he (<font color='blue'><b>Wolfe</b></font>) permitted himself to entertain any, were somewhat melancholy and
despondent. A pleasant afternoon brought them to the end of their ride;
nor did any accident or incident accompany it, save, perhaps, a mistake
which Harry Warrington made at some few miles' distance from Tunbridge
Wells, where two horsemen stopped them, whom Harry was for charging,
pistol in hand, supposing them to be highwaymen. Colonel Wolfe,
laughing, bade Mr. Warrington reserve his (<font color='blue'><b>Wolfe</b></font>) fire, for these folks were
only innkeepers' agents, and not robbers -LRB-except in their calling-RRB-.
Gumbo, whose horse ran away with him (<font color='blue'><b>Wolfe</b></font>) at this particular juncture, was
brought back after a great deal of bawling on his (<font color='blue'><b>Wolfe</b></font>) master's part, and the
two gentlemen rode into the little town, alighted at their inn, and then
separated, each in quest of the ladies whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Wolfe</b></font>) had come to visit.

<p/>Mr. Warrington found his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) aunt installed in handsome lodgings, with a
guard of London lacqueys in her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) anteroom, and to follow her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) chair when
she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) went abroad. She (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) received him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) with the utmost kindness. His (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) cousin,
my Lady Maria, was absent when he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) arrived: I don't know whether the
young gentleman was unhappy at not seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>): or whether he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) disguised
his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) feelings, or whether Madame de Bernstein took any note regarding
them.

<p/>A beau in a rich figured suit, the first specimen of the kind Harry had
seen, and two dowagers with voluminous hoops and plenty of rouge, were
on a visit to the Baroness when her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) nephew made his (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) bow to her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>)
introduced the young man to these personages as her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) nephew, the young
Croesus out of Virginia, of whom they had heard. She (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) talked about the
immensity of his (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) estate, which was as large as Kent; and, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) had
read, infinitely more fruitful. She (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) mentioned how her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) half-sister, Madam
Esmond, was called Princess Pocahontas in her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) own country. She (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) never
tired in her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) praises of mother and son, of their riches and their good
qualities. The beau shook the young man by the hand, and was delighted
to have the honour to make his (<font color='blue'><b>beau</b></font>) acquaintance. The ladies praised him (<font color='blue'><b>beau</b></font>)
to his (<font color='blue'><b>beau</b></font>) aunt so loudly that the modest youth was fain to blush at their
compliments. They went away to inform the Tunbridge society of the news
of his (<font color='blue'><b>beau</b></font>) arrival. The little place was soon buzzing with accounts of the
wealth, the good breeding, and the good looks of the Virginian.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You could not have come at a better moment, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Baroness/Baroness Bernstein/Bernstein</b></font>)</div>the Baroness said
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) nephew, as her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) visitors departed with many curtseys and congees.
<div class="bookquote">``Those three individuals have the most active tongues in the Wells. They
will trumpet your good qualities in every company where they go. I have
introduced you to a hundred people already, and, Heaven help me! have
told all sorts of fibs about the geography of Virginia in order to
describe your estate. It is a prodigious large one, but I am afraid I
have magnified it. I have filled it with all sorts of wonderful animals,
gold mines, spices; I am not sure I have not said diamonds. As for
your negroes, I have given your mother armies of them, and, in fact,
represented her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) as a sovereign princess reigning over a magnificent
dominion. So she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) has a magnificent dominion: I cannot tell to a few
hundred thousand pounds how much her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) yearly income is, but I have no
doubt it is a very great one. And you must prepare, sir, to be treated
here as the heir-apparent of this royal lady. Do not let your head be
turned. From this day forth you are going to be flattered as you have
never been flattered in your life.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And to what end, ma’am?''  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>asked the young gentleman. <div class="bookquote">``I see no reason
why I should be reputed so rich, or get so much flattery.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In the first place, sir, you must not contradict your old aunt, who
has no desire to be made a fool of before her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) company. And as for your
reputation, you must know we found it here almost ready-made on our
arrival. A London newspaper has somehow heard of you, and come out with
a story of the immense wealth of a young gentleman from Virginia lately
landed, and a nephew of my Lord Castlewood. Immensely wealthy you are,
and can't help yourself. All the world is eager to see you. You shall
go to church to-morrow morning, and see how the whole congregation will
turn away from its books and prayers, to worship the golden calf in your
person. You would not have had me undeceive them, would you, and speak
ill of my own flesh and blood?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But how am I bettered by this reputation for money?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>asked Harry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are making your entry into the world, and the gold key will open
most of its doors to you. To be thought rich is as good as to be rich.
You need not spend much money. People will say that you hoard it, and
your reputation for avarice will do you good rather than harm. You'll
see how the mothers will smile upon you, and the daughters will curtsey!
Don't look surprised! When I was a young woman myself I did as all
the rest of the world did, and tried to better myself by more than one
desperate attempt at a good marriage. Your poor grandmother, who was a
saint upon earth to be sure, bating a little jealousy, used to scold me,
and called me worldly. Worldly, my dear! So is the world worldly; and
we must serve it as it serves us; and give it nothing for nothing. Mr.
Henry Esmond Warrington--I can't help loving the two first names, sir,
old woman as I am, and that I tell you--on coming here or to London,
would have been nobody. Our protection would have helped him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) but little.
Our family has little credit, and, entre nous, not much reputation. I
suppose you know that Castlewood was more than suspected in `45, and
hath since ruined himself by play?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry had never heard about Lord Castlewood or his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) reputation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) never had much to lose, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) has lost that and more: his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) wretched
estate is eaten up with mortgages. He (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) has been at all sorts of schemes
to raise money:--my dear, he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) has been so desperate at times, that I did
not think my diamonds were safe with him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>); and have travelled to and from
Castlewood without them. Terrible, isn't it, to speak so of one's own
nephew? But you are my nephew, too, and not spoiled by the world yet,
and I wish to warn you of its wickedness. I heard of your play-doings
with Will and the chaplain, but they could do you no harm,--nay, I am
told you had the better of them. Had you played with Castlewood, you
would have had no such luck: and you would have played, had not an old
aunt of yours warned my Lord Castlewood to keep his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) hands off you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What, ma’am, did you interfere to preserve me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I kept his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) clutches off from you: be thankful that you are come out of
that ogre's den with any flesh on your bones! My dear, it has been the
rage and passion of all our family. My poor silly brother played; both
his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) wives played, especially the last one, who has little else to live
upon now but her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) nightly assemblies in London, and the money for the
cards. I would not trust her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) at Castlewood alone with you: the passion
is too strong for them, and they would fall upon you, and fleece you;
and then fall upon each other, and fight for the plunder. But for his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)
place about the Court my poor nephew hath nothing, and that is Will's
fortune, too, sir, and Maria's and her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) sister's.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And are they, too, fond of the cards?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; to do poor Molly justice, gaming is not her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) passion: but when she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
is amongst them in London, little Fanny will bet her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) eyes out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
head. I know what the passion is, sir: do not look so astonished; I have
had it, as I had the measles when I was a child. I am not cured quite.
For a poor old woman there is nothing left but that. You will see some
high play at my card-tables to-night. Hush! my dear. It was that I
wanted, and without which I moped so at Castlewood! I could not win of
my nieces or their mother. They would not pay if they lost. `Tis best to
warn you, my dear, in time, lest you should be shocked by the discovery.
I can't live without the cards, there's the truth!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Castlewood relatives Harry</b></font>)</div><p/>A few days before, and while staying with his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) Castlewood relatives,
Harry, who loved cards, and cock-fighting, and betting, and every
conceivable sport himself, would have laughed very likely at this
confession. Amongst that family into whose society he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had fallen, many
things were laughed at, over which some folks looked grave. Faith and
honour were laughed at; pure lives were disbelieved; selfishness was
proclaimed as common practice; sacred duties were sneeringly spoken of,
and vice flippantly condoned. These were no Pharisees: they professed no
hypocrisy of virtue, they flung no stones at discovered sinners:--they
smiled, shrugged their shoulders, and passed on. The members of this
family did not pretend to be a whit better than their neighbours, whom
they despised heartily; they lived quite familiarly with the folks about
whom and whose wives they told such wicked, funny stories; they took
their share of what pleasure or plunder came to hand, and lived from day
to day till their last day came for them. Of course there are no such
people now; and human nature is very much changed in the last hundred
years. At any rate, card-playing is greatly out of mode: about that
there can be no doubt: and very likely there are not six ladies of
fashion in London who know the difference between Spadille and Manille.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How dreadfully dull you must have found those humdrum people at that
village where we left you--but the savages were very kind to you,
child!''  (<font color='red'><b>Bernstein/Madame de Bernstein/Madame Bernstein</b></font>)</div>said Madame de Bernstein, patting the young man's cheek with her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>)
pretty old hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They were very kind; and it was not at all dull, ma’am, and I think
they are some of the best people in the world,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>said Harry, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
face flushing up. His (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) aunt's tone jarred upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could not bear
that any one should speak or think lightly of the new friends whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
had found. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) did not want them in such company.

<p/>The old lady, imperious and prompt to anger, was about to resent the
check she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had received, but a second thought made her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) pause. <div class="bookquote">``Those two
girls,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) thought, <div class="bookquote">``a sick-bed--an interesting stranger--of course
he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) has been falling in love with one of them.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Madame Bernstein looked
round with a mischievous glance at Lady Maria, who entered the room at
this juncture.




<p/>CHAPTER XXV. New Acquaintances


<p/>Cousin Maria made her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) appearance, attended by a couple of gardener's
boys bearing baskets of flowers, with which it was proposed to decorate
Madame de Bernstein's drawing-room against the arrival of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) ladyship's
company. Three footmen in livery, gorgeously laced with worsted, set out
twice as many card-tables. A major-domo in black and a bag, with fine
laced ruffles; and looking as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>) ought to have a sword by his (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>) side,
followed the lacqueys bearing fasces of wax candles, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>) placed
a pair on each card-table, and in the silver sconces on the wainscoted
wall that was now gilt with the slanting rays of the sun, as was the
prospect of the green common beyond, with its rocks and clumps of trees
and houses twinkling in the sunshine. Groups of many-coloured figures in
hoops and powder and brocade sauntered over the green, and dappled the
plain with their shadows. On the other side from the Baroness's windows
you saw the Pantiles, where a perpetual fair was held, and heard the
clatter and buzzing of the company. A band of music was here performing
for the benefit of the visitors to the Wells. Madame Bernstein's chief
sitting-room might not suit a recluse or a student, but for those who
liked bustle, gaiety, a bright cross light, and a view of all that was
going on in the cheery busy place, no lodging could be pleasanter. And
when the windows were lighted up, the passengers walking below were
aware that her (<font color='blue'><b>recluse</b></font>) ladyship was at home and holding a card-assembly, to
which an introduction was easy enough. By the way, in speaking of the
past, I think the night-life of society a hundred years since was rather
a dark life. There was not one wax-candle for ten which we now see in a
lady's drawing-room: let alone gas and the wondrous new illuminations
of clubs. Horrible guttering tallow smoked and stunk in passages. The
candle-snuffer was a notorious officer in the theatre. See Hogarth's
pictures: how dark they are, and how his (<font color='blue'><b>Hogarth</b></font>) feasts are, as it were,
begrimed with tallow! In <div class="bookquote">``Marriage a la Mode,''  (<font color='red'><b>Viscount/Lord Viscount Squanderfield</b></font>)</div>in Lord Viscount
Squanderfield's grand saloons, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Squanderfield</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Squanderfield</b></font>) wife are sitting yawning
before the horror-stricken steward when their party is over--there are
but eight candles--one on each card-table, and half a dozen in a brass
chandelier. If Jack Briefless convoked his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) friends to oysters and beer
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) chambers, Pump Court, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) would have twice as many. Let us comfort
ourselves by thinking that Louis Quatorze in all his (<font color='blue'><b>Louis</b></font>) glory held his (<font color='blue'><b>Louis</b></font>)
revels in the dark, and bless Mr. Price and other Luciferous benefactors
of mankind, for banishing the abominable mutton of our youth.

<p/>So Maria with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) flowers -LRB-herself the fairest flower-RRB-, popped her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>)
roses, sweet-williams, and so forth, in vases here and there, and
adorned the apartment to the best of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) art. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) lingered fondly over
this bowl and that dragon jar, casting but sly timid glances the while
at young cousin Harry, whose own blush would have become any young
woman, and you might have thought that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) possibly intended to outstay
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) aunt; but that Baroness, seated in her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) arm-chair, her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) crooked
tortoiseshell stick in her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) hand, pointed the servants imperiously to
their duty; rated one and the other soundly: Tom for having a darn in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) stocking; John for having greased his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) locks too profusely out of the
candle-box; and so forth--keeping a stern domination over them. Another
remark concerning poor Jeames of a hundred years ago: Jeames slept two
in a bed, four in a room, and that room a cellar very likely, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
washed in a trough such as you would hardly see anywhere in London now
out of the barracks of her (<font color='blue'><b>servants</b></font>) Majesty's Foot Guards.

<p/>If Maria hoped a present interview, her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) fond heart was disappointed.
<div class="bookquote">``Where are you going to dine, Harry?''  (<font color='red'><b>Bernstein/Madame de Bernstein/Madame Bernstein</b></font>)</div>asks Madame de Bernstein. <div class="bookquote">``My
niece Maria and I shall have a chicken in the little parlour--I think
you should go to the best ordinary. There is one at the White Horse
at three, we shall hear his (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>) bell in a minute or two. And you will
understand, sir, that you ought not to spare expense, but behave like
Princess Pocahontas's son. Your trunks have been taken over to the
lodging I have engaged for you. It is not good for a lad to be always
hanging about the aprons of two old women. Is it, Maria?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>ladyship</b></font>)</div>says her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) ladyship, dropping her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) meek eyes; whilst the other lady's
glared in triumph. I think Andromeda had been a good deal exposed to the
Dragon in the course of the last five or six days: and if Perseus
had cut the latter's cruel head off he (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>) would have committed not
unjustifiable monstricide. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>) did not bare sword or shield; he (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>) only
looked mechanically at the lacqueys in tawny and blue as they creaked
about the room.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And there are good mercers and tailors from London always here to wait
on the company at the Wells. You had better see them, my dear, for your
suit is not of the very last fashion--a little lace--''

 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't go out of mourning, ma’am,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the young man, looking down at
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sables.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ho, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>cried the lady, rustling up from her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) chair and rising on her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
cane, <div class="bookquote">``wear black for your brother till you are as old as Methuselah,
if you like. I am sure I don't want to prevent you. I only want you to
dress, and to do like other people, and make a figure worthy of your
name.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Madam,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Warrington with great state, <div class="bookquote">``I have not done anything
to disgrace it that I know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div><p/>Why did the old Woman stop and give a little start as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Woman</b></font>) had been
struck? Let bygones be bygones. She (<font color='blue'><b>Woman</b></font>) and the boy had a score of little
passages of this kind in which swords were crossed and thrusts rapidly
dealt or parried. She (<font color='blue'><b>Woman</b></font>) liked Harry none the worse for his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) courage in
facing her (<font color='blue'><b>Woman</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Sure a little finer linen than that shirt you wear will not
be a disgrace to you, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Woman</b></font>) said, with rather a forced laugh.

<p/>Harry bowed and blushed. It was one of the homely gifts of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) Oakhurst
friends. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) felt pleased somehow to think he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wore it; thought of the
new friends, so good, so pure, so simple, so kindly, with immense
tenderness, and felt, while invested in this garment, as if evil could
not touch him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) would go to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) lodging, and make a point of
returning arrayed in the best linen he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come back here, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bernstein/Madame de Bernstein/Madame Bernstein</b></font>)</div>said Madame Bernstein, <div class="bookquote">``and if our company has
not arrived, Maria and I will find some ruffles for you!''  (<font color='red'><b>Bernstein/Madame de Bernstein/Madame Bernstein</b></font>)</div>And herewith,
under a footman's guidance, the young fellow walked off to his (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>) new
lodgings.

<p/>Harry found not only handsome and spacious apartments provided for him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>),
but a groom in attendance waiting to be engaged by his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) honour, and a
second valet, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was inclined to hire one to wait upon Mr. Gumbo. Ere
he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) had been many minutes in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) rooms, emissaries from a London tailor
and bootmaker waited him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) with the cards and compliments of their
employers, Messrs. Regnier and Tull; the best articles in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) modest
wardrobe were laid out by Gumbo, and the finest linen with which
his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) thrifty Virginian mother had provided him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>). Visions of the
snow-surrounded home in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) own country, of the crackling logs and the
trim quiet ladies working by the fire, rose up before him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>). For the
first time a little thought that the homely clothes were not quite smart
enough, the home-worked linen not so fine as it might be, crossed the
young man's mind. That he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) should be ashamed of anything belonging to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
or to Castlewood! That was strange. The simple folks there were only too
well satisfied with all things that were done, or said, or produced
at Castlewood; and Madam Esmond, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) sent her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) son forth on his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)
travels, thought no young nobleman need be better provided. The clothes
might have fitted better and been of a later fashion, to be sure--but
still the young fellow presented a comely figure enough when he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) issued
from his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) apartments, his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) toilet over; and Gumbo calling a chair, marched
beside it, until they reached the ordinary where the young gentleman was
to dine.

<p/>Here he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) expected to find the beau whose acquaintance he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) had made a few
hours before at his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) aunt's lodging, and who had indicated to Harry that
the White Horse was the most modish place for dining at the Wells, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Wells</b></font>) mentioned his (<font color='blue'><b>Wells</b></font>) friend's name to the host: but the landlord and waiters
leading him (<font color='blue'><b>Wells</b></font>) into the room with many smiles and bows assured his (<font color='blue'><b>Wells</b></font>) honour
that his (<font color='blue'><b>Wells</b></font>) honour did not need any other introduction than his (<font color='blue'><b>Wells</b></font>) own, helped
him (<font color='blue'><b>Wells</b></font>) to hang up his (<font color='blue'><b>Wells</b></font>) coat and sword on a peg, asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Wells</b></font>) whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Wells</b></font>) would
drink Burgundy, Pontac, or champagne to his (<font color='blue'><b>Wells</b></font>) dinner, and led him (<font color='blue'><b>Wells</b></font>) to a
table.

<p/>Though the most fashionable ordinary in the village, the White Horse did
not happen to be crowded on this day. Monsieur Barbeau, the landlord,
informed Harry that there was a great entertainment at Summer Hill,
which had taken away most of the company; indeed, when Harry entered
the room, there were but four other gentlemen in it. Two of these guests
were drinking wine, and had finished their dinner: the other two were
young men in the midst of their meal, to whom the landlord, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
passed, must have whispered the name of the new-comer, for they looked
at him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) with some appearance of interest, and made him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) a slight bow
across the table as the smiling host bustled away for Harry's dinner.

<p/>Mr. Warrington returned the salute of the two gentlemen, who bade him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>)
welcome to Tunbridge, and hoped he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) would like the place upon better
acquaintance. Then they smiled and exchanged waggish looks with each
other, of which Harry did not understand the meaning, nor why they cast
knowing glances at the two other guests over their wine.

<p/>One of these persons was in a somewhat tarnished velvet coat with a huge
queue and bag, and voluminous ruffles and embroidery. The other was a
little beetle-browed, hook-nosed, high-shouldered gentleman, whom his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
opposite companion addressed as milor, or my lord, in a very high voice.
My lord, who was sipping the wine before him (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>), barely glanced at the
new-comer, and then addressed himself to his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) own companion.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And so you know the nephew of the old woman--the Croesus who comes to
arrive?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You're thrown out there, Jack!''  (<font color='red'><b>gentleman</b></font>)</div>says one young gentleman to the other.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Never could manage the lingo,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Firebrace</b></font>)</div>said Jack. The two elders had begun to
speak in the French language.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But assuredly, my dear lord!''  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>says the gentleman with the long queue.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You have shown energy, my dear Baron! He (<font color='blue'><b>Baron</b></font>) has been here but two hours.
My people told me of him (<font color='blue'><b>Baron</b></font>) only as I came to dinner.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I knew him (<font color='blue'><b>Baron</b></font>) before!--I have met him (<font color='blue'><b>Baron</b></font>) often in London with the Baroness
and my lord, his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) cousin,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Baron</b></font>)</div>said the Baron.

<p/>A smoking soup for Harry here came in, borne by the smiling host.
<div class="bookquote">``Behold, sir! Behold a potage of my fashion!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>says my landlord, laying
down the dish and whispering to Harry the celebrated name of the
nobleman opposite. Harry thanked Monsieur Barbeau in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) own language,
upon which the foreign gentleman, turning round, grinned most graciously
at Harry, and said, <div class="bookquote">``Fous bossedez notre langue barfaidement, monsieur.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>Mr. Warrington had never heard the French language pronounced in that
manner in Canada. He (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) bowed in return to the foreign gentleman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell me more about the Croesus, my good Baron,''  (<font color='red'><b>lordship</b></font>)</div>continued his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) lordship,
speaking rather superciliously to his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) companion, and taking no notice of
Harry, which perhaps somewhat nettled the young man.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What will you, that I tell you, my dear lord? Croesus is a youth like
other youths; he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) is tall, like other youths; he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) is awkward, like other
youths; he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) has black hair, as they all have who come from the Indies.
Lodgings have been taken for him (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) at Mrs. Rose's toy-shop.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have lodgings there too,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>thought Mr. Warrington. <div class="bookquote">``Who is Croesus
they are talking of? How good the soup is!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) travels with a large retinue,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Baron</b></font>)</div>the Baron continued, <div class="bookquote">``four servants,
two postchaises, and a pair of outriders. His (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) chief attendant is a black
man who saved his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) life from the savages in America, and who will
not hear, on any account, of being made free. He (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) persists in wearing
mourning for his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) elder brother from whom he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) inherits his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) principality.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Baron</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Could anything console you for the death of yours, Chevalier?''  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>cried
out the elder gentleman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Milor! his (<font color='blue'><b>Chevalier</b></font>) property might,''  (<font color='red'><b>Chevalier</b></font>)</div>said the Chevalier, <div class="bookquote">``which you know is not
small.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Chevalier</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Your brother lives on his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) patrimony--which you have told me is
immense--you by your industry, my dear Chevalier.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Milor!''  (<font color='red'><b>Chevalier</b></font>)</div>cries the individual addressed as Chevalier.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``By your industry or your esprit,--how much more noble! Shall you be
at the Baroness's to-night? She (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) ought to be a little of your parents,
Chevalier?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Again I fail to comprehend your lordship,''  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>said the other gentleman,
rather sulkily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) is a woman of great wit--she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) is of noble birth--she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) has
undergone strange adventures--she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) has but little principle -LRB-there you
happily have the advantage of her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>)-RRB-. But what care we men of the world?
You intend to go and play with the young Creole, no doubt, and get as
much money from him (<font color='blue'><b>Chevalier</b></font>) as you can. By the way, Baron, suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>Baron</b></font>) should
be a guet-apens, that young Creole? Suppose our excellent friend has
invented him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) up in London, and brings him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) down with his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) character for
wealth to prey upon the innocent folks here?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``J’y ai souvent pense, milor,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Baron</b></font>)</div>says the little Baron, placing his (<font color='blue'><b>Baron</b></font>) finger
to his (<font color='blue'><b>Baron</b></font>) nose very knowingly, <div class="bookquote">``that Baroness is capable of anything.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Baron</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A Baron--a Baroness, que voulez-vous, my friend? I mean the late
lamented husband. Do you know who he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Intimately. A more notorious villain never dealt a card. At Venice, at
Brussels, at Spa, at Vienna--the gaols of every one of which places he (<font color='blue'><b>villain</b></font>)
knew. I knew the man, my lord.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought you would. I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>villain</b></font>) at the Hague, where I first had the
honour of meeting you, and a more disreputable rogue never entered my
doors. A minister must open them to all sorts of people, Baron,--spies,
sharpers, ruffians of every sort.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Parbleu, milor, how you treat them!''  (<font color='red'><b>lord</b></font>)</div>says my lord's companion.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A man of my rank, my friend--of the rank I held then--of course, must
see all sorts of people--entre autres your acquaintance. What his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) wife
could want with such a name as his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) I can't conceive.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Apparently, it was better than the lady's own.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Effectively! So I have heard of my friend Paddy changing clothes with
the scarecrow. I don't know which name is the most distinguished, that
of the English bishop or the German baron.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My lord,''  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>cried the other gentleman, rising and laying his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) hand on
a large star on his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) coat, <div class="bookquote">``you forget that I, too, am a Baron and a
Chevalier of the Holy Roman--''

 (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``--Order of the Spur!--not in the least, my dear knight and baron!
You will have no more wine? We shall meet at Madame de Bernstein's
to-night.''  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>The knight and baron quitted the table, felt in his (<font color='blue'><b>baron</b></font>)
embroidered pockets, as if for money to give the waiter, who brought him (<font color='blue'><b>baron</b></font>)
his (<font color='blue'><b>baron</b></font>) great laced hat, and waving that menial off with a hand surrounded
by large ruffles and blazing rings, he (<font color='blue'><b>baron</b></font>) stalked away from the room.

<p/>It was only when the person addressed as my lord had begun to speak of
the bishop's widow and the German baron's wife that Harry Warrington
was aware how his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) aunt and himself had been the subject of the two
gentlemen's conversation. Ere the conviction had settled itself on his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>)
mind, one of the speakers had quitted the room, and the other, turning
to a table at which two gentlemen sate, said, <div class="bookquote">``What a little sharper it
is! Everything I said about Bernstein relates mutato nomine to him (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>). I
knew the fellow to be a spy and a rogue. He (<font color='blue'><b>rogue</b></font>) has changed his (<font color='blue'><b>rogue</b></font>) religion I
don't know how many times. I had him (<font color='blue'><b>rogue</b></font>) turned out of the Hague myself when
I was ambassador, and I know he (<font color='blue'><b>rogue</b></font>) was caned in Vienna.''

 (<font color='red'><b>gentlemen</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wonder my Lord Chesterfield associates with such a villain!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>called
out Harry from his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) table. The other couple of diners looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). To
his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) surprise the nobleman so addressed went on talking.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There cannot be a more fieffe coquin than this Poellnitz. Why, Heaven
be thanked, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) has actually left me my snuff-box! You laugh?--the fellow
is capable of taking it.''  (<font color='red'><b>lord</b></font>)</div>And my lord thought it was his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) own satire at
which the young men were laughing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are quite right, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>the diners</b></font>)</div>said one of the two diners, turning to Mr.
Warrington, <div class="bookquote">``though, saving your presence, I don't know what business it
is of yours. My lord will play with anybody who will set him (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>). Don't be
alarmed, he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) is as deaf as a post, and did not hear a word that you said;
and that's why my lord will play with anybody who will put a pack of
cards before him (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>), and that is the reason why he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) consorts with this
rogue.''

 (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Faith, I know other noblemen who are not particular as to their
company,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Morris/Mr. Morris</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Jack.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you mean because I associate with you? I know my company, my good
friend, and I defy most men to have the better of me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div><p/>Not having paid the least attention to Mr. Warrington's angry
interruption, my lord opposite was talking in his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) favourite French with
Monsieur Barbeau, the landlord, and graciously complimenting him (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) on
his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) dinner. The host bowed again and again; was enchanted that his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>)
Excellency was satisfied: had not forgotten the art which he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) had learned
when he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) was a young man in his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) Excellency's kingdom of Ireland. The
salmi was to my lord's liking? He (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) had just served a dish to the young
American seigneur who sate opposite, the gentleman from Virginia.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``To whom?''  (<font color='red'><b>lord</b></font>)</div>My lord's pale face became red for a moment, as he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) asked this
question, and looked towards Harry Warrington, opposite to him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``To the young gentleman from Virginia who has just arrived, and who
perfectly possesses our beautiful language!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Barbeau, thinking
to kill two birds, as it were, with this one stone of a compliment.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And to whom your lordship will be answerable for language reflecting
upon my family, and uttered in the presence of these gentlemen,''
 (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>cried out Mr. Warrington, at the top of his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) voice, determined that his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>)
opponent should hear.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You must go and call into his (<font color='blue'><b>lordship</b></font>) ear, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>lordship</b></font>) may perchance hear you,''
 (<font color='red'><b>the guests</b></font>)</div>said one of the younger guests.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I will take care that his (<font color='blue'><b>lordship</b></font>) lordship shall understand my meaning, one way
or other,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>Mr. Warrington said, with much dignity; <div class="bookquote">``and will not suffer
calumnies regarding my relatives to be uttered by him (<font color='blue'><b>lordship</b></font>) or any other man!''

 (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div><p/>Whilst Harry was speaking, the little nobleman opposite to him (<font color='blue'><b>nobleman</b></font>) did
not hear him (<font color='blue'><b>nobleman</b></font>), but had time sufficient to arrange his (<font color='blue'><b>nobleman</b></font>) own reply. He (<font color='blue'><b>nobleman</b></font>) had
risen, passing his (<font color='blue'><b>nobleman</b></font>) handkerchief once or twice across his (<font color='blue'><b>nobleman</b></font>) mouth, and
laying his (<font color='blue'><b>nobleman</b></font>) slim fingers on the table. <div class="bookquote">``Sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>nobleman</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``you will believe,
on the word of a gentleman, that I had no idea before whom I was
speaking, and it seems that my acquaintance, Monsieur de Poellnitz, knew
you no better than myself. Had I known you, believe me that I should
have been the last man in the world to utter a syllable that should give
you annoyance; and I tender you my regrets and apologies, before my Lord
March and Mr. Morris here present.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>To these words, Mr. Warrington could only make a bow, and mumble out a
few words of acknowledgment: which speech having made believe to hear,
my lord made Harry another very profound bow, and saying he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) should have
the honour of waiting upon Mr. Warrington at his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) lodgings, saluted the
company, and went away.




<p/>CHAPTER XXVI. In which we are at a very Great Distance from Oakhurst


<p/>Within the precinct of the White Horse Tavern, and coming up to the
windows of the eating-room, was a bowling-green, with a table or two,
where guests might sit and partake of punch or tea. The three gentlemen
having come to an end of their dinner about the same time, Mr. Morris
proposed that they should adjourn to the Green, and there drink a cool
bottle. <div class="bookquote">``Jack Morris would adjourn to the Dust Hole, as a pretext for
a fresh drink,''  (<font color='red'><b>lord</b></font>)</div>said my lord. On which Jack said he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) supposed each
gentleman had his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) own favourite way of going to the deuce. His (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) weakness,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) owned, was a bottle.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My Lord Chesterfield's deuce is deuce-ace,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord</b></font>)</div>says my Lord March. <div class="bookquote">``His (<font color='blue'><b>Chesterfield</b></font>)
lordship can't keep away from the cards or dice.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My Lord March has not one devil, but several devils. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) loves gambling,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) loves horse-racing, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) loves betting, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) loves drinking, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) loves
eating, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) loves money, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) loves women; and you have fallen into bad
company, Mr. Warrington, when you lighted upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) lordship. He (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) will
play you for every acre you have in Virginia.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``With the greatest pleasure in life, Mr. Warrington!''  (<font color='red'><b>lord</b></font>)</div>interposes my
lord.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And for all your tobacco, and for all your spices, and for all your
slaves, and for all your oxen and asses, and for everything that is

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Unfortunately, my lord, the tobacco, and the slaves, and the asses, and

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A principality, I hear it is. I will bet that its value has been
exaggerated ten times at least amongst the quidnuncs here. How came
you by the name of Castlewood?--you are related to my lord? Oh, stay: I
know,--my lady, your mother, descends from the real head of the house.
He (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) took the losing side in `15. I have had the story a dozen times from
my old Duchess. She (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>) knew your grandfather. He (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) was friend of Addison and
Steele, and Pope and Milton, I dare say, and the bigwigs. It is a pity
he (<font color='blue'><b>Pope</b></font>) did not stay at home, and transport the other branch of the family to

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have just been staying at Castlewood with my cousin there,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>remarked
Mr. Warrington.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never, but for sixpences and a pool of commerce with the ladies.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So much the better for both of you. But you played with Will Esmond if

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry blushed, and owned that of an evening his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) cousin and he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) had had a
few games at cards.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And Tom Sampson, the chaplain,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Morris/Mr. Morris</b></font>)</div>cried Jack Morris, <div class="bookquote">``was he (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) of the

 (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Morris/Mr. Morris</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay; the truth is, I won of both of them,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Warrington.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And they paid you? Well, miracles will never cease!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I did not say anything about miracles,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Harry/Mr. Harry Warrington</b></font>)</div>remarked Mr. Harry, smiling
over his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wine.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And you don't tell tales out of school--the volto sciolto--hey, Mr.
Warrington?''  (<font color='red'><b>lord</b></font>)</div>says my lord.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I beg your pardon,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>said downright Harry, <div class="bookquote">``French is the only language
besides my own of which I know a little.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My Lord March has learned Italian at the Opera, and a pretty penny
his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) lessons have cost him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Morris/Mr. Morris</b></font>)</div>remarked Jack Morris. <div class="bookquote">``We must show him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) the
Opera--mustn't we, March?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Must we, Morris?''  (<font color='red'><b>lord</b></font>)</div>said my lord, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) only half liked the other's
familiarity.

<p/>Both of the two gentlemen were dressed alike, in small scratch-wigs
without powder, in blue frocks with plate buttons, in buckskins and
riding-boots, in little hats with a narrow cord of lace, and no outward
mark of fashion.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't care about the Opera much, my lord,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>says Harry, warming with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wine; <div class="bookquote">``but I should like to go to Newmarket, and long to see a good

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We will show you Newmarket and the hunting-field, sir. Can you ride
pretty well?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think I can,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>Harry said; <div class="bookquote">``and I can shoot pretty well, and jump
some.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What's your weight? I bet you we weigh even, or I weigh most. I bet you
Jack Morris beats you at birds or a mark, at five-and-twenty paces. I
bet you I jump farther than you on flat ground, here on this green.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know Mr. Morris's shooting--I never saw either gentleman
before--but I take your bets, my lord, at what you please,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>cries Harry,
who by this time was more than warm with Burgundy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ponies on each!''  (<font color='red'><b>lord</b></font>)</div>cried my lord.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Done and done!''  (<font color='red'><b>lord Harry</b></font>)</div>cried my lord and Harry together. The young man thought
it was for the honour of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) country not to be ashamed of any bet made
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We can try the last bet now, if your feet are pretty steady,''  (<font color='red'><b>lord</b></font>)</div>said my
lord, springing up, stretching his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) arms and limbs, and looking at the
crisp, dry grass. He (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) drew his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) boots off, then his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) coat and waistcoat,
buckling his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) belt round his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) waist, and flinging his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) clothes down to the
ground.

<p/>Harry had more respect for his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) garments. It was his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) best suit. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) took
off the velvet coat and waistcoat, folded them up daintily, and, as the
two or three tables round were slopped with drink, went to place the
clothes on a table in the eating-room, of which the windows were open.

<p/>Here a new guest had entered; and this was no other than Mr. Wolfe,
who was soberly eating a chicken and salad, with a modest pint of wine.
Harry was in high spirits. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) told the Colonel he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had a bet with my Lord
March--would Colonel Wolfe stand him (<font color='blue'><b>Wolfe</b></font>) halves? The Colonel said he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) was too
poor to bet. Would he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) come out and see fair play? That he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) would with
all his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) heart. Colonel Wolfe set down his (<font color='blue'><b>Wolfe</b></font>) glass, and stalked through the
open window after his (<font color='blue'><b>Wolfe</b></font>) young friend.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who is that tallow-faced Put with the carroty hair?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Morris/Mr. Morris</b></font>)</div>says Jack Morris,
on whom the Burgundy had had its due effect.

<p/>Mr. Warrington explained that this was Lieutenant-Colonel Wolfe, of the
20th Regiment.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your humble servant, gentlemen!''  (<font color='red'><b>the Colonel</b></font>)</div>says the Colonel, making the company a
rigid military bow.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Never saw such a figure in my life!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Morris/Mr. Morris</b></font>)</div>cries Jack Morris. <div class="bookquote">``Did
you--March?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I beg your pardon, I think you said March?''  (<font color='red'><b>the Colonel</b></font>)</div>said the Colonel, looking
very much surprised.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am the Earl of March, sir, at Colonel Wolfe's service,''  (<font color='red'><b>the nobleman</b></font>)</div>said the
nobleman, bowing. <div class="bookquote">``My friend, Mr. Morris, is so intimate with me, that,
after dinner, we are quite like brothers.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tunbridge/Tunbridge Wells/Wells</b></font>)</div><p/>Why is not all Tunbridge Wells by to hear this? thought Morris. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>)
was so delighted that he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) shouted out, <div class="bookquote">``Two to one on my lord!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Done!''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>calls out Mr. Warrington; and the enthusiastic Jack was obliged
to cry <div class="bookquote">``Done!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Firebrace</b></font>)</div>too.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Take him (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>), Colonel,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>Harry whispers to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) friend.

<p/>But the Colonel said he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) could not afford to lose, and therefore could
not hope to win.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I see you have won one of our bets already, Mr. Warrington,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord</b></font>)</div>my Lord
March remarked. <div class="bookquote">``I am taller than you by an inch or two, but you are
broader round the shoulders.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pooh, my dear Will! I bet you you weigh twice as much as he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) does!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Morris/Mr. Morris</b></font>)</div>cries Jack Morris.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Done, Jack!''  (<font color='red'><b>lord</b></font>)</div>says my lord, laughing. <div class="bookquote">``The bets are all ponies. Will you
take him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>), Mr. Warrington?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, my dear fellow--one's enough,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Firebrace</b></font>)</div>says Jack.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very good, my dear fellow,''  (<font color='red'><b>lord</b></font>)</div>says my lord; <div class="bookquote">``and now we will settle the
other wager.''

 (<font color='red'><b>lord</b></font>)</div><p/>Having already arrayed himself in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) best silk stockings, black
satin-net breeches, and neatest pumps, Harry did not care to take off
his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) shoes as his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) antagonist had done, whose heavy riding-boots and spurs
were, to be sure, little calculated for leaping. They had before them
a fine even green turf of some thirty yards in length, enough for a run
and enough for a jump. A gravel walk ran around this green, beyond which
was a wall and gate-sign--a field azure, bearing the Hanoverian White
Horse rampant between two skittles proper, and for motto the name of the
landlord and of the animal depicted.

<p/>My lord's friend laid a handkerchief on the ground as the mark whence
the leapers were to take their jump, and Mr. Wolfe stood at the other
end of the grass-plat to note the spot where each came down. <div class="bookquote">``My lord
went first,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>writes Mr. Warrington, in a letter to Mrs. Mountain, at
Castlewood, Virginia, still extant. ``He (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) was for having me take the lead;
but, remembering the story about the Battel of Fontanoy which my dearest
George used to tell, I says, `Monseigneur le Comte, tirez le premier,
s'il vous play.' So he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) run in his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) stocken feet, and for the
honour of Old Virginia, I had the gratafacation of beating his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) lordship
by more than two feet--viz., two feet nine inches--me jumping twenty-one
feet three inches, by the drawer's measured tape, and his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) lordship only
eighteen six. I had won from him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) about my weight before -LRB-which I knew
the moment I set my eye upon him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)-RRB-. So he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) and Mr. Jack paid me these two
betts. And with my best duty to my mother--she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) will not be displeased
with me, for I bett for the honor of the Old Dominion, and my opponent
was a nobleman of the first quality, himself holding two Erldomes, and
heir to a Duke. Betting is all the rage here, and the bloods and young
fellows of fashion are betting away from morning till night.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I told them--and that was my mischief perhaps--that there was a
gentleman at home who could beat me by a good foot; and when they asked
who it was, and I said Col. G. Washington, of Mount Vernon--as you know
he (<font color='blue'><b>Vernon</b></font>) can, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Vernon</b></font>)'s the only man in his (<font color='blue'><b>Vernon</b></font>) county or mine that can do it--Mr.
Wolfe asked me ever so many questions about Col. G. W., and showed that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Wolfe</b></font>) had heard of him (<font color='blue'><b>Wolfe</b></font>), and talked over last year's unhappy campane as
if he (<font color='blue'><b>Wolfe</b></font>) knew every inch of the ground, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Wolfe</b></font>) knew the names of all our
rivers, only he (<font color='blue'><b>Wolfe</b></font>) called the Potowmac Pottamac, at which we had a
good laugh at him (<font color='blue'><b>Wolfe</b></font>). My Lord of March and Ruglen was not in the least
ill-humour about losing, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) friend handed me notes out of
their pocket-books, which filled mine that was getting very empty, for
the vales to the servants at my cousin Castlewood's house and buying
a horse at Oakhurst have very nearly put me on the necessity of making
another draft upon my honoured mother or her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) London or Bristol agent.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the gentlemen</b></font>)</div><p/>These feats of activity over, the four gentlemen now strolled out of the
tavern garden into the public walk, where, by this time, a great deal of
company was assembled: upon whom Mr. Jack, who was of a frank and free
nature, with a loud voice, chose to make remarks that were not always
agreeable. And here, if my Lord March made a joke, of which his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) lordship
was not sparing, Jack roared, <div class="bookquote">``Oh, ho, ho! Oh, good Gad! Oh, my dear
earl! Oh, my dear lord, you'll be the death of me!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Firebrace</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It seemed as if he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>)
wished everybody to know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>writes Harry sagaciously to Mrs. Mountain,
<div class="bookquote">``that his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) friend and companion was an Erl!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Mountain/Mountain</b></font>)</div><p/>There was, indeed, a great variety of characters who passed. M.
Poellnitz, no finer dressed than he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had been at dinner, grinned, and
saluted with his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) great laced hat and tarnished feathers. Then came by
my Lord Chesterfield, in a pearl-coloured suit, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Chesterfield</b></font>) blue ribbon and
star, and saluted the young men in his (<font color='blue'><b>Chesterfield</b></font>) turn.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I will back the old boy for taking his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) hat off against the whole
kingdom, and France either,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord</b></font>)</div>says my Lord March. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) has never changed
the shape of that hat of his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) for twenty years. Look at it. There it goes
again! Do you see that great, big, awkward, pock-marked, snuff-coloured
man, who hardly touches his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) clumsy beaver in reply. D-- his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) confounded
impudence--do you know who that is?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, curse him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)! Who is it, March?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Firebrace</b></font>)</div>asks Jack, with an oath.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's one Johnson, a Dictionary-maker, about whom my Lord Chesterfield
wrote some most capital papers, when his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) dixonary was coming out, to
patronise the fellow. I know they were capital. I've heard Horry Walpole
say so, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Horry</b></font>) knows all about that kind of thing. Confound the impudent
schoolmaster!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hang him (<font color='blue'><b>Horry</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Horry</b></font>) ought to stand in the pillory!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Firebrace</b></font>)</div>roars Jack.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That fat man he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s walking with is another of your writing fellows,--a
printer,--his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) name is Richardson; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wrote Clarissa, you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Great heavens! my lord, is that the great Richardson? Is that the man
who wrote Clarissa?''  (<font color='red'><b>Colonel</b></font>)</div>called out Colonel Wolfe and Mr. Warrington, in a
breath.

<p/>Harry ran forward to look at the old gentleman toddling along the walk
with a train of admiring ladies surrounding him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed, my very dear sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>one was saying, <div class="bookquote">``you are too great and good
to live in such a world; but sure you were sent to teach it virtue!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, my Miss Mulso! Who shall teach the teacher?''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the good, fat old
man, raising a kind, round face skywards. <div class="bookquote">``Even he (<font color='blue'><b>Richardson</b></font>) has his (<font color='blue'><b>Richardson</b></font>) faults and

Heaven bless my soul, Mr. Johnson! I ask your pardon if I have trodden
on your corn.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You have done both, sir. You have trodden on the corn, and received the
pardon,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Johnson/Johnson</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Johnson, and went on mumbling some verses, swaying to
and fro, his (<font color='blue'><b>Johnson</b></font>) eyes turned towards the ground, his (<font color='blue'><b>Johnson</b></font>) hands behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Johnson</b></font>), and
occasionally endangering with his (<font color='blue'><b>Johnson</b></font>) great stick the honest, meek eyes of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Johnson</b></font>) companion-author.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They do not see very well, my dear Mulso,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Johnson</b></font>) says to the young lady,
<div class="bookquote">``but such as they are, I would keep my lash from Mr. Johnson's cudgel.
Your servant, sir.''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>Here he (<font color='blue'><b>Johnson</b></font>) made a low bow, and took off his (<font color='blue'><b>Johnson</b></font>) hat to Mr.
Warrington, who shrank back with many blushes, after saluting the great
author. The great author was accustomed to be adored. A gentler wind
never puffed mortal vanity. Enraptured spinsters flung tea-leaves round
him (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>), and incensed him (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) with the coffee-pot. Matrons kissed the slippers
they had worked for him (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>). There was a halo of virtue round his (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) nightcap.
All Europe had thrilled, panted, admired, trembled, wept, over the pages
of the immortal little, kind, honest man with the round paunch. Harry
came back quite glowing and proud at having a bow from him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Ah!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>says
he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``my lord, I am glad to have seen him (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Seen him (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>)! why, dammy, you may see him (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) any day in his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) shop, I suppose?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Firebrace</b></font>)</div>says Jack, with a laugh.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My brother declared that he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>), and Mr. Fielding, I think, was the name,

we came to Europe, his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) first pilgrimage would be to Mr. Richardson,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>cried Harry, always impetuous, honest, and tender, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) spoke of the
dearest friend.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your brother spoke like a man,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wolfe/Wolfe</b></font>)</div>cried Mr. Wolfe, too, his (<font color='blue'><b>Wolfe</b></font>) pale face
likewise flushing up. <div class="bookquote">``I would rather be a man of genius, than a peer of

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Every man to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) taste, Colonel,''  (<font color='red'><b>lord</b></font>)</div>says my lord, much amused. <div class="bookquote">``Your

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So it does me--by gad--perfectly refreshes me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Firebrace</b></font>)</div>cries Jack

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So it does Jack--you see--it actually refreshes Jack! I say, Jack,

Parliament with ten thousand a year?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``March--my Lord March, do you take me for a fool?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Firebrace</b></font>)</div>says Jack, with a
tearful voice. <div class="bookquote">``Have I done anything to deserve this language from you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I would rather win honour than honours: I would rather have genius than

parade towards a young and elderly lady and a gentleman, who were now
advancing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is the beautiful Miss Lowther. I remember now,''  (<font color='red'><b>lord</b></font>)</div>says my lord. <div class="bookquote">``See!

 (<font color='red'><b>Lord Chesterfield</b></font>)</div><p/>The Dictionary-maker, who had shown so little desire to bow to my Lord
Chesterfield, when that famous nobleman courteously saluted him (<font color='blue'><b>nobleman</b></font>), was
here seen to take off his (<font color='blue'><b>nobleman</b></font>) beaver, and bow almost to the ground, before
a florid personage in a large round hat, with bands and a gown, who
made his (<font color='blue'><b>nobleman</b></font>) appearance in the Walk. This was my Lord Bishop of Salisbury,
wearing complacently the blue riband and badge of the Garter, of which
Noble Order his (<font color='blue'><b>Bishop</b></font>) lordship was prelate.

<p/>Mr. Johnson stood, hat in hand, during the whole time of his (<font color='blue'><b>Johnson</b></font>)
conversation with Dr. Gilbert; who made many flattering and benedictory
remarks to Mr. Richardson, declaring that he (<font color='blue'><b>Richardson</b></font>) was the supporter of
virtue, the preacher of sound morals, the mainstay of religion, of all
which points the honest printer himself was perfectly convinced.

<p/>Do not let any young lady trip to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) grandpapa's bookcase in
consequence of this eulogium, and rashly take down Clarissa from the
shelf. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clarissa</b></font>) would not care to read the volumes, over which her (<font color='blue'><b>Clarissa</b></font>) pretty
ancestresses wept and thrilled a hundred years ago; which were commended
by divines from pulpits and belauded all Europe over. I wonder, are our
women more virtuous than their grandmothers, or only more squeamish? If
the former, then Miss Smith of New York is certainly more modest than
Miss Smith of London, who still does not scruple to say that tables,
pianos, and animals have legs. Oh, my faithful, good old Samuel
Richardson! Hath the news yet reached thee in Hades that thy sublime
novels are huddled away in corners, and that our daughters may no more
read Clarissa than Tom Jones? Go up, Samuel, and be reconciled with
thy brother-scribe, whom in life thou didst hate so. I wonder whether
a century hence the novels of to-day will be hidden behind locks and
wires, and make pretty little maidens blush?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who is yonder queer person in the high headdress of my grandmother's
time, who stops and speaks to Mr. Richardson?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>asked Harry, as a
fantastically dressed lady came up, and performed a curtsey and a
compliment to the bowing printer.

<p/>Jack Morris nervously struck Harry a blow in the side with the butt end
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) whip. Lord March laughed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yonder queer person is my gracious kinswoman, Katharine, Duchess of
Dover and Queensberry, at your service, Mr. Warrington. She (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>) was a beauty
price! She (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>) is changed now, isn't she (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>)? What an old Gorgon it is! She (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>) is a
great patroness of your book-men and when that old frump was young, they
actually made verses about her (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Earl</b></font>)</div><p/>The Earl quitted his (<font color='blue'><b>Earl</b></font>) friends for a moment to make his (<font color='blue'><b>Earl</b></font>) bow to the old
Duchess, Jack Morris explaining to Mr. Warrington how, at the Duke's
death, my Lord of March and Ruglen would succeed to his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) cousin's
dukedoms.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>says Harry, simply, <div class="bookquote">``his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) lordship is here in attendance
upon the old lady?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div><p/>Jack burst into a loud laugh.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh yes! very much! exactly!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>says he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Why, my dear fellow, you don't
mean to say you haven't heard about the little Opera-dancer?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am but lately arrived in England, Mr. Morris,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>said Harry, with a
smile, <div class="bookquote">``and in Virginia, I own, we have not heard much about the little
Opera-dancer.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div><p/>Luckily for us, the secret about the little Opera-dancer never was
revealed, for the young men's conversation was interrupted by a lady in
a cardinal cape, and a hat by no means unlike those lovely headpieces
which have returned into vogue a hundred years after the date of our
present history, who made a profound curtsey to the two gentlemen and
received their salutation in return. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) stopped opposite to Harry; she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
held out her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) hand, rather to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wonderment:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you so soon forgotten me, Mr. Warrington?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said.

<p/>Off went Harry's hat in an instant. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) started, blushed, stammered, and
called out Good Heavens! as if there had been any celestial wonder in
the circumstance! It was Lady Maria come out for a walk. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had not been
thinking about her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) was, to say truth, for the moment so utterly
out of the young gentleman's mind, that her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) sudden re-entry there and
appearance in the body startled Mr. Warrington's faculties, and caused
those guilty blushes to crowd into his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) cheeks.

<p/>No. He (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) was not even thinking of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>)! A week ago--a year, a hundred years
ago it seemed--he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) would not have been surprised to meet her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) anywhere.
Appearing from amidst darkling shrubberies, gliding over green garden
terraces, loitering on stairs or corridors, hovering even in his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) dreams,
all day or all night, bodily or spiritually, he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) had been accustomed to
meet her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>). A week ago his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) heart used to beat. A week ago, and at the very
instant when he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) jumped out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) sleep, there was her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) idea smiling on
him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>). And it was only last Tuesday that his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) love was stabbed and slain,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) not only had left off mourning for her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>), but had forgotten her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>)!

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You will come and walk with me a little?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Or would you like
the music best? I dare say you will like the music best.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>said Harry, <div class="bookquote">``I don't care about any music much, except'' (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>--he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
was thinking of the evening hymn--<div class="bookquote">``except of your playing.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) turned
very red again as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) spoke, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) felt he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was perjuring himself horribly.

<p/>The poor lady was agitated herself by the flutter and agitation which
she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) saw in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) young companion. Gracious Heaven! Could that tremor
and excitement mean that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was mistaken, and that the lad was still
faithful? <div class="bookquote">``Give me your arm, and let us take a little walk,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said,
waving round a curtsey to the other two gentlemen: <div class="bookquote">``my aunt is asleep
after her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) dinner.''  (<font color='red'><b>the gentlemen</b></font>)</div>Harry could not but offer the arm, and press the hand
that lay against his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) heart. Maria made another fine curtsey to Harry's
bowing companions, and walked off with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) prize. In her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) griefs, in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) rages, in the pains and anguish of wrong and desertion, how a woman
remembers to smile, curtsey, caress, dissemble! How resolutely they
discharge the social proprieties; how they have a word, or a hand, or
a kind little speech or reply for the passing acquaintance who crosses
unknowing the path of the tragedy, drops a light airy remark or two
-LRB-happy self-satisfied rogue!-RRB- and passes on. He (<font color='blue'><b>rogue</b></font>) passes on, and thinks
that woman was rather pleased with what I said. <div class="bookquote">``That joke I made was
rather neat. I do really think Lady Maria looks rather favourably at me,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>)'s a dev'lish fine woman, begad she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) is!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>O you wiseacre! Such was
Jack Morris's observation and case as he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) walked away leaning on the arm
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) noble friend, and thinking the whole Society of the Wells was
looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Wells</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Wells</b></font>) had made some exquisite remarks about a particular
run of cards at Lady Flushington's the night before, and Lady Maria had
replied graciously and neatly, and so away went Jack perfectly happy.

<p/>The absurd creature! I declare we know nothing of anybody -LRB-but that for
my part I know better and better every day-RRB-. You enter smiling to see
your new acquaintance, Mrs. A. and her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) charming family. You make your
bow in the elegant drawing-room of Mr. and Mrs. B.? I tell you that in
your course through life you are for ever putting your great clumsy foot
upon the mute invisible wounds of bleeding tragedies. Mrs. B.'s closets
for what you know are stuffed with skeletons. Look there under the
sofa-cushion. Is that merely Missy's doll, or is it the limb of
a stifled Cupid peeping out? What do you suppose are those ashes
smouldering in the grate?--Very likely a suttee has been offered up
there just before you came in: a faithful heart has been burned out upon
a callous corpse, and you are looking on the cineri doloso. You see B.
and his (<font color='blue'><b>Cupid</b></font>) wife receiving their company before dinner. Gracious powers! Do
you know that that bouquet which she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) wears is a signal to Captain C.,
and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) will find a note under the little bronze Shakespeare on
the mantelpiece in the study? And with all this you go up and say
some uncommonly neat thing -LRB-as you fancy-RRB- to Mrs. B. about the weather
-LRB-clever dog!-RRB-, or about Lady E.'s last party -LRB-fashionable buck!-RRB-, or
about the dear children in the nursery -LRB-insinuating rogue!-RRB-. Heaven and
earth, my good sir, how can you tell that B. is not going to pitch all
the children out of the nursery window this very night, or that his (<font color='blue'><b>rogue</b></font>) lady
has not made an arrangement for leaving them, and running off with
the Captain? How do you know that those footmen are not disguised
bailiffs?--that yonder large-looking butler -LRB-really a skeleton-RRB- is not
the pawnbroker's man? and that there are not skeleton rotis and entrees
under every one of the covers? Look at their feet peeping from under the
tablecloth. Mind how you stretch out your own lovely little slippers,
madam, lest you knock over a rib or two. Remark the death's-head moths
fluttering among the flowers. See, the pale winding-sheets gleaming in
the wax-candles! I know it is an old story, and especially that this
preacher has yelled vanitas vanitatum five hundred times before. I can't
help always falling upon it, and cry out with particular loudness and
wailing, and become especially melancholy, when I see a dead love tied
to a live love. Ha! I look up from my desk, across the street: and there
come in Mr. and Mrs. D. from their walk in Kensington Gardens. How she (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>)
hangs on him (<font color='blue'><b>preacher</b></font>)! how jolly and happy he (<font color='blue'><b>preacher</b></font>) looks, as the children frisk round!
My poor dear benighted Mrs. D., there is a Regent's Park as well as
a Kensington Gardens in the world. Go in, fond wretch! Smilingly lay
before him (<font color='blue'><b>Regent</b></font>) what you know he (<font color='blue'><b>Regent</b></font>) likes for dinner. Show him (<font color='blue'><b>Regent</b></font>) the children's
copies and the reports of their masters. Go with Missy to the piano, and
play your artless duet together; and fancy you are happy!

<p/>There go Harry and Maria taking their evening walk on the common, away
from the village which is waking up from its after-dinner siesta, and
where the people are beginning to stir and the music to play. With the
music Maria knows Madame de Bernstein will waken: with the candles
she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) must be back to the tea-table and the cards. Never mind. Here is a
minute. It may be my love is dead, but here is a minute to kneel over
the grave and pray by it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>) certainly was not thinking about her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>): he (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>)
was startled and did not even know her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>) was laughing and talking
with Jack Morris and my Lord March. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) is twenty years younger than she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>).
Never mind. To-day is to-day in which we are all equal. This moment is
ours. Come, let us walk a little way over the heath, Harry. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) will go,
though she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) feels a deadly assurance that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) will tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) all is over
between them, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) loves the dark-haired girl at Oakhurst.




<p/>CHAPTER XXVII. Plenus Opus Aleae


<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let me hear about those children, child, whom I saw running about at

so. You know you don't care for me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The people are the very best, kindest, dearest people I have ever met
in the world,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>cries Mr. Warrington. <div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Lambert was a friend of my
mother when she (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) was in Europe for her (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) education. Colonel Lambert is a
most accomplished gentleman, and has seen service everywhere. He (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) was in
Scotland with his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) Royal Highness, in Flanders, at Minorca. No natural
parents could be kinder than they were to me. How can I show my
gratitude to them? I want to make them a present: I must make them
a present,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>says Harry, clapping his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hand into his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) pocket, which was
filled with the crisp spoils of Morris and March.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We can go to the toy-shop, my dear, and buy a couple of dolls for the
children,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maria/Lady Maria/Lady Maria Esmond</b></font>)</div>says Lady Maria. <div class="bookquote">``You would offend the parents by offering

admirable; and Theo composes, and sings songs of her (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) own.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed! I scarcely saw them. I thought they were children. They looked
quite childish. I had no idea they had all these perfections, and were
such wonders of the world.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sure I would find fault with no one who is kind to you, Mr.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, Harry! I am not dear and good. There, sir, you needn't be so

dreadful Mr. Morris was perfectly tipsy when I came to you, and
frightened you so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I had just won great bets from both of them. What shall I buy for
you, my dear cousin?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>And Harry narrated the triumphs which he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had just
achieved. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was in high spirits: he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) laughed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) bragged a little. <div class="bookquote">``For
the honour of Virginia I was determined to show them what jumping was,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``With a little practice I think I could leap two foot farther.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maria/Lady Maria/Lady Maria Esmond</b></font>)</div><p/>Maria was pleased with the victories of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) young champion. <div class="bookquote">``But you
must beware about play, child,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``You know it hath been the

neither,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>says Harry, again fingering the delightful notes. <div class="bookquote">``What do you
play at Aunt Bernstein's? Cribbage, all-fours, brag, whist, commerce,

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you want to begin now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maria/Lady Maria/Lady Maria Esmond</b></font>)</div>said the plaintive Maria. <div class="bookquote">``You don't care

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hey! Youth is youth, cousin!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Harry/Mr. Harry Warrington</b></font>)</div>cried Mr. Harry, tossing up his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) head,
<div class="bookquote">``and a young fellow must have his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) fling!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Harry/Mr. Harry Warrington</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) strutted by his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
partner's side, confident, happy, and eager for pleasure. Not long ago
he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) did like to walk with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>). Only yesterday, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) liked to be with Theo
and Hester, and good Mrs. Lambert; but pleasure, life, gaiety, the
desire to shine and to conquer, had also their temptations for the lad,
who seized the cup like other lads, and did not care to calculate on
the headache in store for the morning. Whilst he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) cousin were
talking, the fiddles from the open orchestra on the Parade made a great
tuning and squeaking, preparatory to their usual evening concert. Maria
knew her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) aunt was awake again, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) must go back to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) slavery.
Harry never asked about that slavery, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) must have known it, had
he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) taken the trouble to think. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) never pitied his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) cousin. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was not
thinking about her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) at all. Yet when his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) mishap befell him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) had been
wounded far more cruelly than he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had scarce ever been out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>)
thoughts, which of course she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) had had to bury under smiling hypocrisies,
as is the way with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) sex. I know, my dear Mrs. Grundy, you think she (<font color='blue'><b>Grundy</b></font>)
was an old fool? Ah! do you suppose fools' caps do not cover grey hair,
as well as jet or auburn? Bear gently with our elderly fredaines, O you
Minerva of a woman! Or perhaps you are so good and wise that you don't
read novels at all. This I know, that there are late crops of wild oats,
as well as early harvests of them; and -LRB-from observation of self and
neighbour-RRB- I have an idea that the avena fatua grows up to the very last
days of the year.

<p/>Like worldly parents anxious to get rid of a troublesome child, and go
out to their evening party, Madame Bernstein and her (<font color='blue'><b>Minerva</b></font>) attendants had put
the sun to bed, whilst it was as yet light, and had drawn the curtains
over it, and were busy about their cards and their candles, and their
tea and negus, and other refreshments. One chair after another landed
ladies at the Baroness's door, more or less painted, patched, brocaded.
To these came gentlemen in gala raiment. Mr. Poellnitz's star was the
largest, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) coat the most embroidered of all present. My Lord of
March and Ruglen, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) made his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) appearance, was quite changed from
the individual with whom Harry had made acquaintance at the White Horse.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) tight brown scratch was exchanged for a neatly curled feather
top, with a bag and grey powder, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) jockey-dress and leather breeches
replaced by a rich and elegant French suit. Mr. Jack Morris had just
such another wig and a suit of stuff as closely as possible resembling
his (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) lordship's. Mr. Wolfe came in attendance upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Wolfe</b></font>) beautiful
mistress, Miss Lowther, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) aunt who loved cards, as all the world
did. When my Lady Maria Esmond made her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) appearance, `tis certain that
her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) looks belied Madame Bernstein's account of her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>). Her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) shape was very
fine, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) dress showed a great deal of it. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) complexion was by
nature exceeding fair, and a dark frilled ribbon, clasped by a jewel,
round her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) neck, enhanced its. snowy whiteness. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) cheeks were not
redder than those of other ladies present, and the roses were pretty
openly purchased by everybody at the perfumery-shops. An artful patch
or two, it was supposed, added to the lustre of her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) charms. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) hoop was
not larger than the iron contrivances which ladies of the present day
hang round their persons; and we may pronounce that the costume, if
absurd in some points, was pleasing altogether. Suppose our ladies took
to wearing of bangles and nose-rings? I dare say we should laugh at the
ornaments, and not dislike them, and lovers would make no difficulty
about lifting up the ring to be able to approach the rosy lips
underneath.

<p/>As for the Baroness de Bernstein, when that lady took the pains of
making a grand toilette, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) appeared as an object, handsome still, and
magnificent, but melancholy, and even somewhat terrifying to behold.
You read the past in some old faces, while some others lapse into
mere meekness and content. The fires go quite out of some eyes, as the
crow's-feet pucker round them; they flash no longer with scorn, or
with anger, or love; they gaze, and no one is melted by their sapphire
glances; they look, and no one is dazzled. My fair young reader, if
you are not so perfect a beauty as the peerless Lindamira, Queen of the
Ball; if, at the end of it, as you retire to bed, you meekly own that
you have had but two or three partners, whilst Lindamira has had a crowd
round her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) all night--console yourself with thinking that, at fifty, you
will look as kind and pleasant as you appear now at eighteen. You will
not have to lay down your coach-and-six of beauty and see another step
into it, and walk yourself through the rest of life. You will have
to forgo no long-accustomed homage; you will not witness and own the
depreciation of your smiles. You will not see fashion forsake your
quarter; and remain all dust, gloom, cobwebs within your once splendid
saloons, and placards in your sad windows, gaunt, lonely, and to let!
You may not have known any grandeur, but you won't feel any desertion.
You will not have enjoyed millions, but you will have escaped
bankruptcy. <div class="bookquote">``Our hostess,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Chesterfield</b></font>)</div>said my Lord Chesterfield to his (<font color='blue'><b>Chesterfield</b></font>) friend in a
confidential whisper, of which the utterer did not in the least know the
loudness, <div class="bookquote">``puts me in mind of Covent Garden in my youth. Then it was
the court end of the town, and inhabited by the highest fashion. Now, a
nobleman's house is a gaming-house, or you may go in with a friend and
call for a bottle.''

 (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hey! a bottle and a tavern are good things in their way,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord</b></font>)</div>says my Lord
March, with a shrug of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) shoulders. <div class="bookquote">``I was not born before the
Georges came in, though I intend to live to a hundred. I never knew the
Bernstein but as an old woman; and if she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) ever had beauty, hang me if I
know how she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) spent it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, hang me, how did she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) spend it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Morris/Mr. Morris</b></font>)</div>laughs out Jack Morris.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here's a table! Shall we sit down and have a game?--Don't let the
Frenchman come in. He (<font color='blue'><b>Frenchman</b></font>) won't pay. Mr. Warrington, will you take a card?''
 (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>Mr. Warrington and my Lord Chesterfield found themselves partners
against Mr. Morris and the Earl of March. <div class="bookquote">``You have come too late,
Baron,''  (<font color='red'><b>the nobleman</b></font>)</div>says the elder nobleman to the other nobleman who was advancing.
<div class="bookquote">``We have made our game. What, have you forgotten Mr. Warrington of
Virginia--the young gentleman whom you met in London?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The young gentleman whom I met at Arthur's Chocolate House had black
hair, a little cocked nose, and was by no means so fortunate in his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>)
personal appearance as Mr. Warrington,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Baron</b></font>)</div>said the Baron, with much
presence of mind. <div class="bookquote">``Warrington, Dorrington, Harrington? We of the
continent cannot retain your insular names. I certify that this
gentleman is not the individual of whom I spoke at dinner.''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>And,
glancing kindly upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Baron</b></font>), the old beau sidled away to a farther end
of the room, where Mr. Wolfe and Miss Lowther were engaged in deep
conversation in the embrasure of a window. Here the Baron thought fit to
engage the Lieutenant-Colonel upon the Prussian manual exercise, which
had lately been introduced into King George II.'s army--a subject with
which Mr. Wolfe was thoroughly familiar, and which no doubt would
have interested him (<font color='blue'><b>Wolfe</b></font>) at any other moment but that. Nevertheless the old
gentleman uttered his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) criticisms and opinions, and thought he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) perfectly
charmed the two persons to whom he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) communicated them.

<p/>At the commencement of the evening the Baroness received her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) guests
personally, and as they arrived engaged them in talk and introductory
courtesies. But as the rooms and tables filled, and the parties were
made up, Madame de Bernstein became more and more restless, and finally
retreated with three friends to her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) own corner, where a table specially
reserved for her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) was occupied by her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) major-domo. And here the old lady
sate down resolutely, never changing her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) place or quitting her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) game till
cock-crow. The charge of receiving the company devolved now upon my Lady
Maria, who did not care for cards, but dutifully did the honours of the
house to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) aunt's guests, and often rustled by the table where her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>)
young cousin was engaged with his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) three friends.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come and cut the cards for us,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord</b></font>)</div>said my Lord March to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) ladyship as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) passed on one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) wistful visits. <div class="bookquote">``Cut the cards and bring us
luck, Lady Maria! We have had none to-night, and Mr. Warrington is
winning everything.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope you are not playing high, Harry?''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>said the lady, timidly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh no, only sixpences,''  (<font color='red'><b>lord</b></font>)</div>cried my lord, dealing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Only sixpences,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Morris/Mr. Morris</b></font>)</div>echoed Mr. Morris, who was Lord March's partner. But
Mr. Morris must have been very keenly alive to the value of sixpence, if
the loss of a few such coins could make his (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) round face look so dismal.
My Lord Chesterfield sate opposite Mr. Warrington, sorting his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) cards. No
one could say, by inspecting that calm physiognomy, whether good or ill
fortune was attending his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) lordship.

<p/>Some word, not altogether indicative of delight, slipped out of Mr.
Morris's lips, on which his (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) partner cried out, <div class="bookquote">``Hang it, Morris, play
your cards, and hold your tongue!''  (<font color='red'><b>partner</b></font>)</div>Considering they were only playing
for sixpences, his (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) lordship, too, was strangely affected.

<p/>Maria, still fondly lingering by Harry's chair, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) hand at the
back of it, could see his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) cards, and that a whole covey of trumps was
ranged in one corner. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) had not taken away his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) luck. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) was pleased
to think she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) had cut that pack which had dealt him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) all those pretty
trumps. As Lord March was dealing, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) had said in a quiet voice to Mr.
Warrington, <div class="bookquote">``The bet as before, Mr. Warrington, or shall we double it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Anything you like, my lord,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Warrington, very quietly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We will say, then,--shillings.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, shillings,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Warrington, and the game proceeded.

<p/>The end of the day's, and some succeeding days' sport may be gathered
from the following letter, which was never delivered to the person to
whom it was addressed, but found its way to America in the papers of Mr.
Henry Warrington:


<p/>``TUNBRIDGE WELLS, August 10, 1756.

<p/>``DEAR GEORGE--As White's two bottles of Burgundy and a pack of cards
constitute all the joys of your life, I take for granted that you are in
London at this moment, preferring smoke and faro to fresh air and fresh
haystacks. This will be delivered to you by a young gentleman with whom
I have lately made acquaintance, and whom you will be charmed to know.
He (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) will play with you at any game for any stake, up to any hour of the
night, and drink any reasonable number of bottles during the play.
Mr. Warrington is no other than the Fortunate Youth about whom so many
stories have been told in the Public Advertiser and other prints. He (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>)
has an estate in Virginia as big as Yorkshire, with the incumbrance of a
mother, the reigning Sovereign; but, as the country is unwholesome, and
fevers plentiful, let us hope that Mrs. Esmond will die soon, and
leave this virtuous lad in undisturbed possession. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) is aunt of that
polisson of a Castlewood, who never pays his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) play-debts, unless he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) is
more honourable in his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) dealings with you than he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) has been with me. Mr.
W. is de bonne race. We must have him (<font color='blue'><b>W.</b></font>) of our society, if it be only that
I may win my money back from him (<font color='blue'><b>W.</b></font>).

<p/>``He (<font color='blue'><b>W.</b></font>) has had the devil's luck here, and has been winning everything,
whilst his (<font color='blue'><b>W.</b></font>) old card-playing beldam of an aunt has been losing. A few
nights ago, when I first had the ill-luck to make his (<font color='blue'><b>W.</b></font>) acquaintance, he (<font color='blue'><b>W.</b></font>)
beat me in jumping -LRB-having practised the art amongst the savages, and
running away from bears in his (<font color='blue'><b>W.</b></font>) native woods-RRB-; he (<font color='blue'><b>W.</b></font>) won bets off me and
Jack Morris about my weight; and at night, when we sat down to play, at
old Bernstein's, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>) won from us all round. If you can settle our last
Epsom account please hand over to Mr. Warrington 350 pounds, which I
still owe him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>), after pretty well emptying my pocket-book. Chesterfield
has dropped six hundred to him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>), too; but his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) lordship does not wish
to have it known, having sworn to give up play and live cleanly. Jack
Morris, who has not been hit as hard as either of us, and can afford it
quite as well, for the fat chuff has no houses nor train to keep up, and
all his (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) misbegotten father's money in hand, roars like a bull of Bashan
about his (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) losses. We had a second night's play, en petit comite, and
Barbeau served us a fair dinner in a private room. Mr. Warrington
holds his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) tongue like a gentleman, and none of us have talked about our
losses; but the whole place does, for us. Yesterday the Cattarina looked
as sulky as thunder, because I would not give her (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) a diamond necklace,
and says I refuse her (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) because I have lost five thousand to the
Virginian. My old Duchess of Q. has the very same story, besides knowing
to a fraction what Chesterfield and Jack have lost.

<p/>``Warrington treated the company to breakfast and music at the rooms; and
you should have seen how the women tore him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) to pieces. That fiend of
a Cattarina ogled him (<font color='blue'><b>fiend</b></font>) out of my vis-a-vis, and under my very nose,
yesterday, as we were driving to Penshurst, and I have no doubt has sent
him (<font color='blue'><b>fiend</b></font>) a billet-doux ere this. He (<font color='blue'><b>fiend</b></font>) shot Jack Morris all to pieces at a mark:
we shall try him (<font color='blue'><b>fiend</b></font>) with partridges when the season comes.

<p/>``He (<font color='blue'><b>fiend</b></font>) is a fortunate fellow, certainly. He (<font color='blue'><b>fiend</b></font>) has youth -LRB-which is not
deboshed by evil courses in Virginia, as ours is in England-RRB-; he (<font color='blue'><b>fiend</b></font>) has
good health, good looks, and good luck.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``In a word, Mr. Warrington has won our money in a very gentlemanlike
manner; and, as I like him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>), and wish to win some of it back again, I put
him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) under your worship's saintly guardianship. Adieu! I am going to the
North, and shall be back for Doncaster.--Yours ever, dear George, M. et R.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER XXVIII. The Way of the World


<p/>Our young Virginian found himself, after two or three days at Tunbridge
Wells, by far the most important personage in that merry little
watering-place. No nobleman in the place inspired so much curiosity. My
Lord Bishop of Salisbury himself was scarce treated with more respect.
People turned round to look after Harry as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) passed, and country-folks
stared at him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) as they came into market. At the rooms, matrons encouraged
him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) to come round to them, and found means to leave him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) alone with their
daughters, most of whom smiled upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). Everybody knew, to an acre and
a shilling, the extent of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) Virginian property, and the amount of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
income. At every tea-table in the Wells, his (<font color='blue'><b>Wells</b></font>) winnings at play were told
and calculated. Wonderful is the knowledge which our neighbours have
of our affairs! So great was the interest and curiosity which Harry
inspired, that people even smiled upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) servant, and took Gumbo aside
and treated him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) with ale and cold meat, in order to get news of the
young Virginian. Mr. Gumbo fattened under the diet, became a leading
member of the Society of Valets in the place, and lied more enormously
than ever. No party was complete unless Mr. Warrington attended it. The
lad was not a little amused and astonished by this prosperity, and bore
his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) new honours pretty well. He (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) had been bred at home to think too well
of himself, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) present good fortune no doubt tended to confirm his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>)
self-satisfaction. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) was not too much elated. He (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) did not brag about
his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) victories or give himself any particular airs. In engaging in play
with the gentlemen who challenged him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) had acted up to his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) queer code
of honour. He (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) felt as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) was bound to meet them when they summoned
him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>), and that if they invited him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) to a horse-race, or a drinking-bout,
or a match at cards, for the sake of Old Virginia he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) must not draw back.
Mr. Harry found his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) new acquaintances ready to try him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) at all these
sports and contests. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had a strong head, a skilful hand, a firm seat,
an unflinching nerve. The representative of Old Virginia came off very
well in his (<font color='blue'><b>representative</b></font>) friendly rivalry with the mother-country.

<p/>Madame de Bernstein, who got her (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintances</b></font>) fill of cards every night, and, no
doubt, repaired the ill-fortune of which we heard in the last chapter,
was delighted with her (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintances</b></font>) nephew's victories and reputation. He (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) had shot
with Jack Morris and beat him (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) had ridden a match with Mr. Scamper
and won it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) played tennis with Captain Batts, and, though the boy had
never tried the game before, in a few days he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) held his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) own uncommonly
well. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had engaged in play with those celebrated gamesters, my Lords
of Chesterfield and March; and they both bore testimony to his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) coolness,
gallantry, and good breeding. At his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) books Harry was not brilliant
certainly; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could write as well as a great number of men of
fashion; and the naivete of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) ignorance amused the old lady. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had
read books in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) time, and could talk very well about them with bookish
people: she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had a relish for humour and delighted in Moliere and Mr.
Fielding, but she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) loved the world far better than the library, and was
never so interested in any novel but that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) would leave it for a
game of cards. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) superintended with fond pleasure the improvements of
Harry's toilette: rummaged out fine laces for his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) ruffles and shirt,
and found a pretty diamond-brooch for his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) frill. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) attained the post of
prime favourite of all her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) nephews and kinsfolk. I fear Lady Maria was
only too well pleased at the lad's successes, and did not grudge him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>)
superiority over her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) brothers; but those gentlemen must have quaked with
fear and envy when they heard of Mr. Warrington's prodigious successes,
and the advance which he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) had made in their wealthy aunt's favour.

<p/>After a fortnight of Tunbridge, Mr. Harry had become quite a personage.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) knew all the good company in the place. Was it his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) fault if he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) became
acquainted with the bad likewise? Was he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) very wrong in taking the world
as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) found it, and drinking from that sweet sparkling pleasure-cup,
which was filled for him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) to the brim? The old aunt enjoyed his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) triumphs,
and for her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) part only bade him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) pursue his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) enjoyments. She (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) was not a
rigorous old moralist, nor, perhaps, a very wholesome preceptress for
youth. If the Cattarina wrote him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) billets-doux, I fear Aunt Bernstein
would have bade him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) accept the invitations: but the lad had brought with
him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) from his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) colonial home a stock of modesty which he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) still wore
along with the honest homespun linen. Libertinism was rare in those
thinly-peopled regions from which he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) came. The vices of great cities
were scarce known or practised in the rough towns of the American
continent. Harry Warrington blushed like a girl at the daring talk of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) new European associates: even Aunt Bernstein's conversation and
jokes astounded the young Virginian, so that the worldly old woman would
call him (<font color='blue'><b>Virginian</b></font>) Joseph, or simpleton.

<p/>But, however innocent he (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) was, the world gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) credit for being as
bad as other folks. How was he (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) to know that he (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) was not to associate with
that saucy Cattarina? He (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) had seen my Lord March driving her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) about in his (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>)
lordship's phaeton. Harry thought there was no harm in giving her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
arm, and parading openly with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) in the public walks. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) took a fancy
to a trinket at the toy-shop; and, as his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) pockets were full of money,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was delighted to make her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) a present of the locket, which she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) coveted.
The next day it was a piece of lace: again Harry gratified her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). The
next day it was something else: there was no end to Madame Cattarina's
fancies: but here the young gentleman stopped, turning off her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) request
with a joke and a laugh. He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was shrewd enough, and not reckless or
prodigal, though generous. He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had no idea of purchasing diamond drops
for the petulant little lady's pretty ears.

<p/>But who was to give him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) credit for his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) Modesty? Old Bernstein insisted
upon believing that her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) nephew was playing Don Juan's part, and
supplanting my Lord March. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) insisted the more when poor Maria was
by; loving to stab the tender heart of that spinster, and enjoying her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>)
niece's piteous silence and discomfiture.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Baroness/Baroness Bernstein/Bernstein</b></font>)</div>says the Baroness, <div class="bookquote">``boys will be boys, and I don't want
Harry to be the first milksop in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) family!''  (<font color='red'><b>Baroness/Baroness Bernstein/Bernstein</b></font>)</div>The bread which Maria
ate at her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) aunt's expense choked her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) sometimes. O me, how hard and
indigestible some women know how to make it!

<p/>Mr. Wolfe was for ever coming over from Westerham to pay court to the
lady of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wolfe</b></font>) love; and, knowing that the Colonel was entirely engaged
in that pursuit, Mr. Warrington scarcely expected to see much of him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>),
however much he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) liked that officer's conversation and society. It was
different from the talk of the ribald people round about Harry. Mr.
Wolfe never spoke of cards, or horses' pedigrees; or bragged of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wolfe</b></font>)
performances in the hunting-field; or boasted of the favours of women;
or retailed any of the innumerable scandals of the time. It was not a
good time. That old world was more dissolute than ours. There was an old
king with mistresses openly in his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) train, to whom the great folks of
the land did honour. There was a nobility, many of whom were mad and
reckless in the pursuit of pleasure; there was a looseness of words
and acts which we must note, as faithful historians, without going into
particulars, and needlessly shocking honest readers. Our young gentleman
had lighted upon some of the wildest of these wild people, and had found
an old relative who lived in the very midst of the rout.

<p/>Harry then did not remark how Colonel Wolfe avoided him (<font color='blue'><b>Wolfe</b></font>), or when they
casually met, at first, notice the Colonel's cold and altered demeanour.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) did not know the stories that were told of him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>). Who does know the
stories that are told of him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>)? Who makes them? Who are the fathers of
those wondrous lies? Poor Harry did not know the reputation he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was
getting; and that, whilst he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was riding his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) horse and playing his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) game
and taking his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) frolic, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was passing amongst many respectable persons
for being the most abandoned and profligate and godless of young men.

<p/>Alas, and alas! to think that the lad whom we liked so, and who was so
gentle and quiet when with us, so simple and so easily pleased, should
be a hardened profligate, a spendthrift, a confirmed gamester, a
frequenter of abandoned women! These stories came to honest Colonel
Lambert at Oakhurst: first one bad story, then another, then crowds of
them, till the good man's kind heart was quite filled with grief and
care, so that his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) family saw that something annoyed him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). At first he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
would not speak on the matter at all, and put aside the wife's fond
queries. Mrs. Lambert thought a great misfortune had happened; that
her (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) husband had been ruined; that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had been ordered on a dangerous
service; that one of the boys was ill, disgraced, dead; who can resist
an anxious woman, or escape the cross-examination of the conjugal
pillow? Lambert was obliged to tell a part of what he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) knew about Harry
Warrington. The wife was as much grieved and amazed as her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) husband had
been. From papa's and mamma's bedroom the grief, after being stifled for
a while under the bed-pillows there, came downstairs. Theo and Hester
took the complaint after their parents, and had it very bad. O kind,
little, wounded hearts! At first Hester turned red, flew into a great
passion, clenched her (<font color='blue'><b>Hester</b></font>) little fists, and vowed she (<font color='blue'><b>Hester</b></font>) would not believe a
word of the wicked stories; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Hester</b></font>) ended by believing them. Scandal
almost always does master people; especially good and innocent people.
Oh, the serpent they had nursed by their fire! Oh, the wretched,
wretched boy! To think of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) walking about with that horrible painted
Frenchwoman, and giving her (<font color='blue'><b>Frenchwoman</b></font>) diamond necklaces, and parading his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) shame
before all the society at the Wells! The three ladies having cried over
the story, and the father being deeply moved by it, took the parson
into their confidence. In vain he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) preached at church next Sunday his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
favourite sermon about scandal, and inveighed against our propensity to
think evil. We repent we promise to do so no more; but when the next
bad story comes about our neighbour we believe it. So did those kind,
wretched Oakhurst folks believe what they heard about poor Harry
Warrington.

<p/>Harry Warrington meanwhile was a great deal too well pleased with
himself to know how ill his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) friends were thinking of him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>), and was
pursuing a very idle and pleasant, if unprofitable, life, without having
the least notion of the hubbub he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) was creating, and the dreadful repute
in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) was held by many good men. Coming out from a match at tennis
with Mr. Batts, and pleased with his (<font color='blue'><b>Batts</b></font>) play and all the world, Harry
overtook Colonel Wolfe, who had been on one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) visits to the lady
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) heart. Harry held out his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hand, which the Colonel took, but
the latter's salutation was so cold, that the young man could not help
remarking it, and especially noting how Mr. Wolfe, in return for a fine
bow from Mr. Batts's hat, scarcely touched his (<font color='blue'><b>Batts</b></font>) own with his (<font color='blue'><b>Batts</b></font>) forefinger.
The tennis Captain walked away looking somewhat disconcerted, Harry
remaining behind to talk with his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) friend of Westerham. Mr. Wolfe walked
by him (<font color='blue'><b>Wolfe</b></font>) for a while, very erect, silent, and cold.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have not seen you these many days,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>says Harry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You have had other companions,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wolfe/Wolfe</b></font>)</div>remarks Mr. Wolfe, curtly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But I had rather be with you than any of them,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>cries the young man.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed I might be better company for you than some of them,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>says the
other.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it Captain Batts you mean?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>asked Harry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Batts</b></font>) is no favourite of mine, I own; he (<font color='blue'><b>Batts</b></font>) bore a rascally reputation when
he (<font color='blue'><b>Batts</b></font>) was in the army, and I doubt has not mended it since he (<font color='blue'><b>Batts</b></font>) was turned
out. You certainly might find a better friend than Captain Batts. Pardon
the freedom which I take in saying so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wolfe/Wolfe</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Wolfe, grimly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Friend! he (<font color='blue'><b>Friend</b></font>) is no friend: he (<font color='blue'><b>Friend</b></font>) only teaches me to play tennis: he (<font color='blue'><b>Friend</b></font>) is
hand-in-glove with my lord, and all the people of fashion here who
play.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not a man of fashion,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wolfe/Wolfe</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Wolfe.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear Colonel, what is the matter? Have I angered you in any way? You
speak almost as if I had, and I am not conscious of having done anything
to forfeit your regard,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Warrington.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I will be free with you, Mr. Warrington,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Colonel</b></font>)</div>said the Colonel, gravely,
<div class="bookquote">``and tell you with frankness that I don't like some of your friends!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Colonel</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, sure, they are men of the first rank and fashion in England,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>cries Harry, not choosing to be offended with his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) companion's bluntness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Exactly, they are men of too high rank and too great fashion for a
hard-working poor soldier like me; and if you continue to live with
such, believe me, you will find numbers of us humdrum people can't
afford to keep such company. I am here, Mr. Warrington, paying my
addresses to an honourable lady. I met you yesterday openly walking with
a French ballet-dancer, and you took off your hat. I must frankly tell
you, that I had rather you would not take off your hat when you go out
in such company.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Warrington, growing very red, <div class="bookquote">``do you mean that I am to
forgo the honour of Colonel Wolfe's acquaintance altogether?''

 (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I certainly shall request you to do so when you are in company with
that person,''  (<font color='red'><b>Colonel</b></font>)</div>said Colonel Wolfe, angrily; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Wolfe</b></font>) used a word not to be
written at present, though Shakespeare puts it in the mouth of Othello.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Great heavens! what a shame it is to speak so of any woman!''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>cries
Mr. Warrington. <div class="bookquote">``How dare any man say that that poor creature is not
honest?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You ought to know best, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry</b></font>)</div>says the other, looking at Harry with
some surprise, <div class="bookquote">``or the world belies you very much.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What ought I to know best? I see a poor little French dancer who is
come hither with her (<font color='blue'><b>dancer</b></font>) mother, and is ordered by the doctors to drink the
waters. I know that a person of my rank in life does not ordinarily
keep company with people of hers; but really, Colonel Wolfe, are you so
squeamish? Have I not heard you say that you did not value birth, and
that all honest people ought to be equal? Why should I not give this
little unprotected woman my arm? there are scarce half a dozen people
here who can speak a word of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) language. I can talk a little French,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is welcome to it; and if Colonel Wolfe does not choose to touch
his (<font color='blue'><b>Wolfe</b></font>) hat to me, when I am walking with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), by George he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) may leave it
alone,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>cried Harry, flushing up.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't mean to say,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wolfe/Wolfe</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Wolfe, eyeing him (<font color='blue'><b>Wolfe</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``that you don't
know the woman's character?''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course, sir, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is a dancer, and, I suppose, no better or worse
than her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) neighbours. But I mean to say that, had she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) been a duchess, or
your grandmother, I couldn't have respected her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) more.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't mean to say that you did not win her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) at dice, from Lord
March?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``At what?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``At dice, from Lord March. Everybody knows the story. Not a person at
the Wells is ignorant of it. I heard it but now, in the company of that
good old Mr. Richardson, and the ladies were saying that you would be a
character for a colonial Lovelace.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What on earth else have they said about me?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>asked Harry Warrington;
and such stories as he (<font color='blue'><b>Wolfe</b></font>) knew the Colonel told. The most alarming accounts
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) own wickedness and profligacy were laid before him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) was a
corrupter of virtue, an habitual drunkard and gamester, a notorious
blasphemer and freethinker, a fitting companion for my Lord March,
finally, and the company into whose society he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) had fallen. <div class="bookquote">``I tell you
these things,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wolfe/Wolfe</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Wolfe, <div class="bookquote">``because it is fair that you should know
what is said of you, and because I do heartily believe, from your manner
of meeting the last charge brought against you, that you are innocent of
most of the other counts. I feel, Mr. Warrington, that I, for one, have
been doing you a wrong; and sincerely ask you to pardon me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wolfe/Wolfe</b></font>)</div><p/>Of course, Harry was eager to accept his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) friend's apology, and they
shook hands with sincere cordiality this time. In respect of most of the
charges brought against him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), Harry rebutted them easily enough: as for
the play, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) owned to it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) thought that a gentleman should not refuse
a fair challenge from other gentlemen, if his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) means allowed him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>): and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
never would play beyond his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) means. After winning considerably at first,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could afford to play large stakes, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was playing with other
people's money. Play, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) thought, was fair,--it certainly was pleasant.
Why, did not all England, except the Methodists, play? Had he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) not seen
the best company at the Wells over the cards--his (<font color='blue'><b>Wells</b></font>) aunt amongst them?

<p/>Mr. Wolfe made no immediate comment upon Harry's opinion as to the
persons who formed the best company at the Wells, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Wells</b></font>) frankly talked
with the young man, whose own frankness had won him (<font color='blue'><b>Wells</b></font>), and warned him (<font color='blue'><b>Wells</b></font>) that
the life he (<font color='blue'><b>Wells</b></font>) was leading might be the pleasantest, but surely was not the
most profitable of lives. <div class="bookquote">``It can't be, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Colonel</b></font>)</div>said the Colonel, <div class="bookquote">``that
a man is to pass his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) days at horse-racing and tennis, and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) nights
carousing or at cards. Sure, every man was made to do some work: and a
gentleman, if he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) has none, must make some. Do you know the laws of your
country, Mr. Warrington? Being a great proprietor, you will doubtless
one day be a magistrate at home. Have you travelled over the country,
and made yourself acquainted with its trades and manufactures? These
are fit things for a gentleman to study, and may occupy him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) as well as
a cock-fight or a cricket-match. Do you know anything of our profession?
That, at least, you will allow, is a noble one; and, believe me, there
is plenty in it to learn, and suited, I should think, to you. I speak of
it rather than of books and the learned professions, because, as far as
I can judge, your genius does not lie that way. But honour is the aim of
life,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Colonel</b></font>)</div>cried Mr. Wolfe, <div class="bookquote">``and every man can serve his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) country one way or
the other. Be sure, sir, that idle bread is the most dangerous of all
that is eaten; that cards and pleasure may be taken by way of pastime
after work, but not instead of work, and all day. And do you know, Mr.
Warrington, instead of being the Fortunate Youth, as all the world calls
you, I think you are rather Warrington the Unlucky, for you are followed
by daily idleness, daily flattery, daily temptation, and the Lord, I
say, send you a good, deliverance out of your good fortune.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wolfe/Wolfe</b></font>)</div><p/>But Harry did not like to tell his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) aunt that afternoon why it was he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
looked so grave. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) would not drink, but there were some
jolly fellows at the ordinary who passed the bottle round; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) meant
not to play in the evening, but a fourth was wanted at his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) aunt's table,
and how could he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) resist? He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was the old lady's partner several times
during the night, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had Somebody's own luck to be sure; and once
more he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) saw the dawn, and feasted on chickens and champagne at sunrise.




<p/>CHAPTER XXIX. In which Harry continues to enjoy Otium sine Dignitate


<p/>Whilst there were card-players enough to meet her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) at her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) lodgings and
the assembly-rooms, Madame de Bernstein remained pretty contentedly at
the Wells, scolding her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) niece, and playing her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) rubber. At Harry's age
almost all places are pleasant, where you can have lively company,
fresh air, and your share of sport and diversion. Even all pleasure is
pleasant at twenty. We go out to meet it with alacrity, speculate upon
its coming, and when its visit is announced, count the days until it and
we shall come together. How very gently and coolly we regard it towards
the close of Life's long season! Madam, don't you recollect your first
ball; and does not your memory stray towards that happy past, sometimes,
as you sit ornamenting the wall whilst your daughters are dancing? I,
for my part, can remember when I thought it was delightful to walk three
miles and back in the country to dine with old Captain Jones. Fancy
liking to walk three miles, now, to dine with Jones and drink his (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>)
half-pay port! No doubt it was bought from the little country-town
wine-merchant, and cost but a small sum; but `twas offered with a kindly
welcome, and youth gave it a flavour which no age of wine or man can
impart to it nowadays. Viximus nuper. I am not disposed to look so
severely upon young Harry's conduct and idleness, as his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) friend the
stern Colonel of the Twentieth Regiment. O blessed idleness! Divine lazy
nymph! Reach me a novel as I lie in my dressing-gown at three o’clock in
the afternoon; compound a sherry-cobbler for me, and bring me a cigar!
Dear slatternly, smiling Enchantress! They may assail thee with bad
names--swear thy character away, and call thee the Mother of Evil; but,
for all that, thou art the best company in the world!

<p/>My Lord of March went away to the North; and my Lord Chesterfield,
finding the Tunbridge waters did no good to his (<font color='blue'><b>Chesterfield</b></font>) deafness, returned to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Chesterfield</b></font>) solitude at Blackheath; but other gentlemen remained to sport and
take their pleasure, and Mr. Warrington had quite enough of companions
at his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) ordinary at the White Horse. He (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) soon learned to order a French
dinner as well as the best man of fashion out of St. James's; could
talk to Monsieur Barbeau, in Monsieur B.'s native language, much more
fluently than most other folks,--discovered a very elegant and decided
taste in wines, and could distinguish between Clos Vougeot and Romande
with remarkable skill. He (<font color='blue'><b>Barbeau</b></font>) was the young King of the Wells, of which
the general frequenters were easygoing men of the world, who were by no
means shocked at that reputation for gallantry and extravagance which
Harry had got, and which had so frightened Mr. Wolfe.

<p/>Though our Virginian lived amongst the revellers, and swam and sported
in the same waters with the loose fish, the boy had a natural shrewdness
and honesty which kept him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) clear of the snares and baits which are
commonly set for the unwary. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) made very few foolish bets with the
jolly idle fellows round about him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), and the oldest hands found it
difficult to take him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) in. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) engaged in games outdoors and in, because
he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had a natural skill and aptitude for them, and was good to hold
almost any match with any fair competitor. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was scrupulous to play
only with those gentlemen whom he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) knew, and always to settle his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) own
debts on the spot. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) would have made but a very poor figure at a
college examination; though he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) possessed prudence and fidelity, keen,
shrewd perception, great generosity, and dauntless personal courage.

<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was not without occasions for showing of what stuff he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was made.
For instance, when that unhappy little Cattarina, who had brought him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
into so much trouble, carried her (<font color='blue'><b>competitor</b></font>) importunities beyond the mark at which
Harry thought his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) generosity should stop, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) withdrew from the advances
of the Opera-House Siren with perfect coolness and skill, leaving her (<font color='blue'><b>competitor</b></font>)
to exercise her (<font color='blue'><b>competitor</b></font>) blandishments upon some more easy victim. In vain the
mermaid's hysterical mother waited upon Harry, and vowed that a cruel
bailiff had seized all her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) daughter's goods for debt, and that her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
venerable father was at present languishing in a London gaol. Harry
declared that between himself and the bailiff there could be no
dealings, and that because he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had had the good fortune to become known
to Mademoiselle Cattarina, and to gratify her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) caprices by presenting her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
with various trinkets and knick-knacks for which she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had a fancy, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was
not bound to pay the past debts of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) family, and must decline being
bail for her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) papa in London, or settling her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) outstanding accounts at
Tunbridge. The Cattarina's mother first called him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) a monster and an
ingrate, and then asked him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>), with a veteran smirk, why he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) did not take
pay for the services he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) had rendered to the young person? At first, Mr.
Warrington could not understand what the nature of the payment might be:
but when that matter was explained by the old woman, the honest lad
rose up in horror, to think that a woman should traffic in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) child's
dishonour, told her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) came from a country where the very savages
would recoil from such a bargain; and, having bowed the old lady
ceremoniously to the door, ordered Gumbo to mark her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) well, and never
admit her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) lodgings again. No doubt she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) retired breathing
vengeance against the Iroquois: no Turk or Persian, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) declared, would
treat a lady so: and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) daughter retreated to London as soon
as their anxious landlord would let them. Then Harry had his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) perils of
gaming, as well as his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) perils of gallantry. A man who plays at bowls,
as the phrase is, must expect to meet with rubbers. After dinner at the
ordinary, having declined to play piquet any further with Captain Batts,
and being roughly asked his (<font color='blue'><b>Batts</b></font>) reason for refusing, Harry fairly told the
Captain that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) only played with gentlemen who paid, like himself:
but expressed himself so ready to satisfy Mr. Batts, as soon as their
outstanding little account was settled, that the Captain declared
himself satisfied d’avance, and straightway left the Wells without
paying Harry or any other creditor. Also he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had an occasion to show
his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) spirit by beating a chairman who was rude to old Miss Whiffler one
evening as she (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was going to the assembly: and finding that the calumny
regarding himself and that unlucky opera-dancer was repeated by Mr.
Hector Buckler, one of the fiercest frequenters of the Wells, Mr.
Warrington stepped up to Mr. Buckler in the pump-room, where the latter
was regaling a number of water-drinkers with the very calumny, and
publicly informed Mr. Buckler that the story was a falsehood, and that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Buckler</b></font>) should hold any person accountable to himself who henceforth uttered
it. So that though our friend, being at Rome, certainly did as Rome did,
yet he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) showed himself to be a valorous and worthy Roman; and, hurlant
avec les loups, was acknowledged by Mr. Wolfe himself to be as brave as
the best of the wolves.

<p/>If that officer had told Colonel Lambert the stories which had given the
latter so much pain, we may be sure that when Mr. Wolfe found his (<font color='blue'><b>Wolfe</b></font>) young
friend was innocent, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wolfe</b></font>) took the first opportunity to withdraw the
odious charges against him (<font color='blue'><b>Wolfe</b></font>). And there was joy among the Lamberts,
in consequence of the lad's acquittal--something, doubtless, of that
pleasure, which is felt by higher natures than ours, at the recovery of
sinners. Never had the little family been so happy--no, not even when
they got the news of Brother Tom winning his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) scholarship--as when
Colonel Wolfe rode over with the account of the conversation which he (<font color='blue'><b>Wolfe</b></font>)
had with Harry Warrington. <div class="bookquote">``Hadst thou brought me a regiment, James,
I think I should not have been better pleased,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lambert</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Lambert. Mrs.
Lambert called to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) daughters who were in the garden, and kissed
them both when they came in, and cried out the good news to them. Hetty
jumped for joy, and Theo performed some uncommonly brilliant operations
upon the harpsichord that night; and when Dr. Boyle came in for his (<font color='blue'><b>Boyle</b></font>)
backgammon, he (<font color='blue'><b>Boyle</b></font>) could not, at first, account for the illumination in all
their faces, until the three ladies, in a happy chorus, told him (<font color='blue'><b>Boyle</b></font>) how
right he (<font color='blue'><b>Boyle</b></font>) had been in his (<font color='blue'><b>Boyle</b></font>) sermon, and how dreadfully they had wronged
that poor dear, good young Mr. Warrington.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What shall we do, my dear?''  (<font color='red'><b>the Colonel</b></font>)</div>says the Colonel to his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) wife. <div class="bookquote">``The hay is
in, the corn won't be cut for a fortnight,--the horses have nothing to
do. Suppose we...''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And here he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) leans over the table and whispers in her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
ear.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dearest Martin! The very thing!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Lambert/Lambert</b></font>)</div>cries Mrs. Lambert, taking her (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>)
husband's hand and pressing it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What's the very thing, mother?''  (<font color='red'><b>Charley</b></font>)</div>cries young Charley, who is home for
his (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) Bartlemytide holidays.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The very thing is to go to supper. Come, Doctor! We will have a bottle
of wine to-night, and drink repentance to all who think evil.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Amen,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Doctor</b></font>)</div>says the Doctor; <div class="bookquote">``with all my heart!''  (<font color='red'><b>the Doctor</b></font>)</div>And with this the worthy
family went to their supper.




<p/>CHAPTER XXX. Contains a Letter to Virginia


<p/>Having repaired one day to his (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) accustomed dinner at the White Horse
ordinary, Mr. Warrington was pleased to see amongst the faces round the
table the jolly, good-looking countenance of Parson Sampson, who was
regaling the company when Harry entered, with stories and bons-mots,
which kept them in roars of laughter. Though he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had not been in London
for some months, the parson had the latest London news, or what passed
for such with the folks at the ordinary: what was doing in the King's
house at Kensington; and what in the Duke's in Pall Mall: how Mr. Byng
was behaving in prison, and who came to him (<font color='blue'><b>Byng</b></font>): what were the odds at
Newmarket, and who was the last reigning toast in Covent Garden;--the
jolly chaplain could give the company news upon all these points,--news
that might not be very accurate indeed, but was as good as if it
were for the country gentlemen who heard it. For suppose that my Lord
Viscount Squanderfield was ruining himself for Mrs. Polly, and Sampson
called her (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>) Mrs. Lucy? that it was Lady Jane who was in love with
the actor, and not Lady Mary? that it was Harry Hilton, of the Horse
Grenadiers, who had the quarrel with Chevalier Solingen, at Marybone
Garden, and not Tommy Ruffler, of the Foot Guards? The names and dates
did not matter much. Provided the stories were lively and wicked, their
correctness was of no great importance; and Mr. Sampson laughed and
chattered away amongst his (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) country gentlemen, charmed them with his (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>)
spirits and talk, and drank his (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) share of one bottle after another, for
which his (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) delighted auditory persisted in calling. A hundred years ago,
the Abbe Parson, the clergyman who frequented the theatre, the tavern,
the racecourse, the world of fashion, was no uncommon character
in English society: his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) voice might be heard the loudest in the
hunting-field; he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) could sing the jolliest song at the Rose or the
Bedford Head, after the play was over at Covent Garden, and could call a
main as well as any at the gaming-table.

<p/>It may have been modesty, or it may have been claret, which caused his (<font color='blue'><b>Head</b></font>)
reverence's rosy face to redden deeper, but when he (<font color='blue'><b>Head</b></font>) saw Mr. Warrington
enter, he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) whispered <div class="bookquote">``Maxima debetur''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>to the laughing country squire who
sat next him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) drab coat and gold-laced red waistcoat, and rose up
from his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) chair and ran, nay, stumbled forward, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) haste to greet the
Virginian: <div class="bookquote">``My dear sir, my very dear sir, my conqueror of spades, and
clubs, and hearts, too, I am delighted to see your honour looking so
fresh and well,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Virginian</b></font>)</div>cries the chaplain.

<p/>Harry returned the clergyman's greeting with great pleasure: he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was glad
to see Mr. Sampson; he (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) could also justly compliment his (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) reverence upon
his (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) cheerful looks and rosy gills.

<p/>The squire in the drab coat knew Mr. Warrington; he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) made a place beside
himself; he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) called out to the parson to return to his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) seat on the other
side, and to continue his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) story about Lord Ogle and the grocer's wife
in------. Where he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) did not say, for his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) sentence was interrupted by a
shout and an oath addressed to the parson for treading on his (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) gouty toe.

<p/>The chaplain asked pardon, hurriedly turned round to Mr. Warrington,
and informed him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>), and the rest of the company indeed, that my Lord
Castlewood sent his (<font color='blue'><b>Castlewood</b></font>) affectionate remembrances to his (<font color='blue'><b>Castlewood</b></font>) cousin, and had
given special orders to him (<font color='blue'><b>Castlewood</b></font>) -LRB-Mr. Sampson-RRB- to come to Tunbridge Wells and
look after the young gentleman's morals; that my Lady Viscountess and my
Lady Fanny were gone to Harrogate for the waters; that Mr. Will had won
his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) money at Newmarket, and was going on a visit to my Lord Duke;
that Molly the housemaid was crying her (<font color='blue'><b>housemaid</b></font>) eyes out about Gumbo, Mr.
Warrington's valet;--in fine, all the news of Castlewood and its
neighbourhood. Mr. Warrington was beloved by all the country round,
Mr. Sampson told the company, managing to introduce the names of some
persons of the very highest rank into his (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) discourse. <div class="bookquote">``All Hampshire had
heard of his (<font color='blue'><b>conqueror</b></font>) successes at Tunbridge, successes of every kind,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sampson/Mr. Sampson</b></font>)</div>says
Mr. Sampson, looking particularly arch; my lord hoped, their ladyships
hoped, Harry would not be spoilt for his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) quiet Hampshire home.

<p/>The guests dropped off one by one, leaving the young Virginian to his (<font color='blue'><b>Virginian</b></font>)
bottle of wine and the chaplain.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Though I have had plenty,''  (<font color='red'><b>the chaplain reason</b></font>)</div>says the jolly chaplain, <div class="bookquote">``that is no reason
why I should not have plenty more,''  (<font color='red'><b>the chaplain reason</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>chaplain</b></font>) drank toast after toast, and
bumper after bumper, to the amusement of Harry, who always enjoyed his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
society.

<p/>By the time when Sampson had had his (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``plenty more,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sampson/Mr. Sampson</b></font>)</div>Harry, too, was
become specially generous, warm-hearted, and friendly. A lodging--why
should Mr. Sampson go to the expense of an inn, when there was a room
at Harry's quarters? The chaplain's trunk was ordered thither, Gumbo was
bidden to make Mr. Sampson comfortable--most comfortable; nothing would
satisfy Mr. Warrington but that Sampson should go down to his (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) stables
and see his (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) horses; he (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) had several horses now; and when at the stable
Sampson recognised his (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) own horse which Harry had won from him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>); and the
fond beast whinnied with pleasure, and rubbed his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) nose against his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) old
master's coat; Harry rapped out a brisk energetic expression or two, and
vowed by Jupiter that Sampson should have his (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) old horse back again:
he (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) would give him (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) to Sampson, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) would; a gift which the chaplain
accepted by seizing Harry's hand, and blessing him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>),--by flinging his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
arms round the horse's neck, and weeping for joy there, weeping tears
of Bordeaux and gratitude. Arm-in-arm the friends walked to Madame
Bernstein's from the stable, of which they brought the odours into her (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
ladyship's apartment. Their flushed cheeks and brightened eyes showed
what their amusement had been. Many gentlemen's cheeks were in the habit
of flushing in those days, and from the same cause.

<p/>Madame Bernstein received her (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) nephew's chaplain kindly enough. The old
lady relished Sampson's broad jokes and rattling talk from time to time,
as she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) liked a highly-spiced dish or a new entree composed by her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) cook,
upon its two or three first appearances. The only amusement of which she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
did not grow tired, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) owned, was cards. <div class="bookquote">``The cards don't cheat,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
used to say. <div class="bookquote">``A bad hand tells you the truth to your face: and there is
nothing so flattering in the world as a good suite of trumps.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And when
she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was in a good humour, and sitting down to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) favourite pastime, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
would laughingly bid her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) nephew's chaplain say grace before the meal.
Honest Sampson did not at first care to take a hand at Tunbridge Wells.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) ladyship's play was too high for him (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) would own, slapping his (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>)
pocket with a comical piteous look, and its contents had already been
handed over to the fortunate youth at Castlewood. Like most persons of
her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) age, and indeed her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) sex, Madame Bernstein was not prodigal of money.
I suppose it must have been from Harry Warrington, whose heart was
overflowing with generosity as his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) purse with guineas, that the chaplain
procured a small stock of ready coin, with which he (<font color='blue'><b>chaplain</b></font>) was presently
enabled to appear at the card-table.

<p/>Our young gentleman welcomed Mr. Sampson to his (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) coin, as to all the rest
of the good things which he (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) had gathered about him (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>). `Twas surprising how
quickly the young Virginian adapted himself to the habits of life of
the folks amongst whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Virginian</b></font>) lived. His (<font color='blue'><b>Virginian</b></font>) suits were still black, but of the
finest cut and quality. <div class="bookquote">``With a star and ribbon, and his (<font color='blue'><b>conqueror</b></font>) stocking down,
and his (<font color='blue'><b>conqueror</b></font>) hair over his (<font color='blue'><b>conqueror</b></font>) shoulder, he (<font color='blue'><b>conqueror</b></font>) would make a pretty Hamlet,''  (<font color='red'><b>Duchess</b></font>)</div>said the
gay old Duchess Queensberry. <div class="bookquote">``And I make no doubt he (<font color='blue'><b>conqueror</b></font>) has been the death
of a dozen Ophelias already, here and amongst the Indians,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>) added,
thinking not at all the worse of Harry for his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) supposed successes among
the fair. Harry's lace and linen were as fine as his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) aunt could desire.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) purchased fine shaving-plate of the toy-shop women, and a couple of
magnificent brocade bedgowns, in which his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) worship lolled at ease, and
sipped his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) chocolate of a morning. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had swords and walking-canes, and
French watches with painted backs and diamond settings, and snuff boxes
enamelled by artists of the same cunning nation. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had a levee of
grooms, jockeys, tradesmen, daily waiting in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) anteroom, and admitted
one by one to him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) and Parson Sampson, over his (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) chocolate, by Gumbo, the
groom of the chambers. We have no account of the number of men whom Mr.
Gumbo now had under him (<font color='blue'><b>Gumbo</b></font>). Certain it is that no single negro could have
taken care of all the fine things which Mr. Warrington now possessed,
let alone the horses and the postchaise which his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) honour had bought.
Also Harry instructed himself in the arts which became a gentleman in
those days. A French fencing-master, and a dancing-master of the same
nation, resided at Tunbridge during that season when Harry made
his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) appearance: these men of science the young Virginian sedulously
frequented, and acquired considerable skill and grace in the peaceful
and warlike accomplishments which they taught. Ere many weeks were over
he (<font color='blue'><b>Virginian</b></font>) could handle the foils against his (<font color='blue'><b>Virginian</b></font>) master or any frequenter of the
fencing-school,--and, with a sigh, Lady Maria -LRB-who danced very elegantly
herself-RRB- owned that there was no gentleman at court who could walk a
minuet more gracefully than Mr. Warrington. As for riding, though Mr.
Warrington took a few lessons on the great horse from a riding-master
who came to Tunbridge, he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) declared that their own Virginian manner was
well enough for him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>), and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) saw no one amongst the fine folks
and the jockeys who could ride better than his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) friend Colonel George
Washington of Mount Vernon.

<p/>The obsequious Sampson found himself in better quarters than he (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) had
enjoyed for ever so long a time. He (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) knew a great deal of the world, and
told a great deal more, and Harry was delighted with his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) stories, real
or fancied. The man of twenty looks up to the man of thirty, admires
the latter's old jokes, stale puns, and tarnished anecdotes, that are
slopped with the wine of a hundred dinner-tables. Sampson's town and
college pleasantries were all new and charming to the young Virginian. A
hundred years ago,--no doubt there are no such people left in the world
now,--there used to be grown men in London who loved to consort with
fashionable youths entering life; to tickle their young fancies with
merry stories; to act as Covent Garden Mentors and masters of ceremonies
at the Round-house; to accompany lads to the gaming-table, and perhaps
have an understanding with the punters; to drink lemonade to Master
Hopeful's Burgundy, and to stagger into the streets with perfectly
cool heads when my young lord reeled out to beat the watch. Of this, no
doubt, extinct race, Mr. Sampson was a specimen: and a great comfort it
is to think -LRB-to those who choose to believe the statement-RRB- that in Queen
Victoria's reign there are no flatterers left, such as existed in the
reign of her (<font color='blue'><b>Victoria</b></font>) royal great-grandfather, no parasites pandering to the
follies of young men; in fact, that all the toads have been eaten off
the face of the island -LRB-except one or two that are found in stones,
where they have lain perdus these hundred years-RRB-, and the toad-eaters
have perished for lack of nourishment.

<p/>With some sauces, as I read, the above-mentioned animals are said to
be exceedingly fragrant, wholesome, and savoury eating. Indeed, no man
could look more rosy and healthy, or flourish more cheerfully, than
friend Sampson upon the diet. He (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) became our young friend's confidential
leader, and, from the following letter, which is preserved in the
Warrington correspondence, it will be seen that Mr. Harry not only
had dancing and fencing masters, but likewise a tutor, chaplain, and
secretary:--


<p/>TO MRS. ESMOND WARRINGTON OF CASTLEWOOD AT HER HOUSE AT RICHMOND,
VIRGINIA

<p/>Mrs. Bligh's Lodgings, Pantiles, Tunbridge Wells,

<p/>``August 25th, 1756.

<p/>``HONOURED MADAM--Your honoured letter of 20 June, per Mr. Trail of
Bristol, has been forwarded to me duly, and I have to thank your
goodness and kindness for the good advice which you are pleased to give
me, as also for the remembrances of dear home, which I shall love never
the worse for having been to the home of our ancestors in England.

<p/>``I writ you a letter by the last monthly packet, informing my honoured
mother of the little accident I had on the road hither, and of the
kind friends who I found and whom took me in. Since then I have been
profiting of the fine weather and the good company here, and have made
many friends among our nobility, whose acquaintance I am sure you will
not be sorry that I should make. Among their lordships I may mention the
famous Earl of Chesterfield, late Ambassador to Holland, and Viceroy of
the Kingdom of Ireland; the Earl of March and Ruglen, who will be Duke
of Queensberry at the death of his (<font color='blue'><b>Earl</b></font>) Grace; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Grace</b></font>) Grace the Duchess, a
celebrated beauty of the Queen's time, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) remembers my grandpapa
at Court. These and many more persons of the first fashion attend my
aunt's assemblies, which are the most crowded at this crowded place.
Also on my way hither I stayed at Westerham, at the house of an officer,
Lieut.-Gen. Wolfe, who served with my grandfather and General Webb
in the famous wars of the Duke of Marlborough. Mr. Wolfe has a son,
Lieut.-Col. James Wolfe, engaged to be married to a beautiful lady now
in this place, Miss Lowther of the North--and though but 30 years old he (<font color='blue'><b>Wolfe</b></font>)
is looked up to as much as any officer in the whole army, and has served
with honour under his (<font color='blue'><b>Wolfe</b></font>) Royal Highness the Duke wherever our arms have
been employed.

<p/>``I thank my honoured mother for announcing to me that a quarter's
allowance of 52l. 10s. will be paid me by Mr. Trail. I am in no present
want of cash, and by practising a rigid economy, which will be necessary
-LRB-as I do not disguise-RRB- for the maintenance of horses, Gumbo, and the
equipage and apparel requisite for a young gentleman of good family,
hope to be able to maintain my credit without unduly trespassing upon
yours. The linnen and clothes which I brought with me will with due care
last for some years--as you say. `Tis not quite so fine as worn here by
persons of fashion, and I may have to purchase a few very fine shirts
for great days: but those I have are excellent for daily wear.

<p/>``I am thankful that I have been quite without occasion to use your
excellent family pills. Gumbo hath taken them with great benefit, who
grows fat and saucy upon English beef, ale, and air. He (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) sends his (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) humble
duty to his (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) mistress, and prays Mrs. Mountain to remember him (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) to all
his (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) fellow-servants, especially Dinah and Lily, for whom he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) has bought
posey-rings at Tunbridge Fair.

<p/>``Besides partaking of all the pleasures of the place, I hope my honoured
mother will believe that I have not been unmindful of my education.
I have had masters in fencing and dancing, and my Lord Castlewood's
chaplain, the Reverend Mr. Sampson, having come hither to drink the
waters, has been so good as to take a vacant room at my lodging. Mr. S.
breakfasts with me, and we read together of a morning--he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) saying that I
am not quite such a dunce as I used to appear at home. We have read
in Mr. Rapin's History, Dr. Barrow's Sermons, and, for amusement,
Shakspeare, Mr. Pope's Homer, and -LRB-in French-RRB- the translation of an
Arabian Work of Tales, very diverting. Several men of learning have been
staying here besides the persons of fashion; and amongst the former was
Mr. Richardson, the author of the famous books which you and Mountain
and my dearest brother used to love so. He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) was pleased when I told him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)
that his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) works were in your closet in Virginia, and begged me to convey
his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) respectful compliments to my lady-mother. Mr. R. is a short fat man,
with little of the fire of genius visible in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) eye or person.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My aunt and my cousin, the Lady Maria, desire their affectionate
compliments to you, and with best regards for Mountain, to whom I
enclose a note, I am,--Honoured madam, your dutiful son, H. ESMOND
WARRINGTON.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Madam Esmond/Madam Esmond Warrington/Madam Warrington</b></font>)</div><p/>Note in Madam Esmond's Handwriting,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``From my son. Received October 15 at Richmond. Sent 16 jars preserved
peaches, 224 lbs. best tobacco, 24 finest hams, per Royal William of
Liverpool, 8 jars peaches, 12 hams for my nephew, the Rt.. Honourable
the Earl of Castlewood. 4 jars, 6 hams for the Baroness Bernstein, ditto
ditto for Mrs. Lambert of Oakhurst, Surrey, and 1/2 cwt. tobacco.

<p/>``For Mrs. Mountain.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you mien, you silly old Mountain, by sending an order for your
poor old divadends dew at Xmas? I'd have you to know I don't want your

money. But I'm obleaged to you all same. A kiss to Fanny from--Your
loving HARRY.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Madam Esmond/Madam Esmond Warrington/Madam Warrington</b></font>)</div><p/>Note in Madam Esmond's Handwriting

<p/>``This note, which I desired M. to show to me, proves that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) hath a
good heart, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) wished to show her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) gratitude to the family, by
giving up her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) half-yearly divd. -LRB-on L500 3 per ct.-RRB- to my boy. Hence
I reprimanded her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) very slightly for daring to send money to Mr. E.
Warrington, unknown to his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) mother. Note to Mountain not so well spelt as
letter to me.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mem. to write to Revd. Mr. Sampson desire to know what theolog. books
he (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) reads with H. Recommend Law, Baxter, Drelincourt.--Request H. to say
his (<font color='blue'><b>H.</b></font>) catechism to Mr. S., which he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) has never quite been able to master.
By next ship peaches -LRB-3-RRB-, tobacco 1/2 cwt. Hams for Mr. S.''


 (<font color='red'><b>The mother</b></font>)</div><p/>The mother of the Virginians and her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) sons have long long since passed
away. So how are we to account for the fact, that of a couple of letters
sent under one enclosure and by one packet, one should be well spelt,
and the other not entirely orthographical? Had Harry found some
wonderful instructor, such as exists in the present lucky times, and
who would improve his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) writing in six lessons? My view of the case, after
deliberately examining the two notes, is this: No. 1, in which there
appears a trifling grammatical slip -LRB-<div class="bookquote">``the kind, friends who I found and
whom took me in'' (<font color='red'><b>a tutor friend</b></font>)</div>-RRB-, must have been re-written from a rough copy which
had probably undergone the supervision of a tutor or friend. The more
artless composition, No. 2, was not referred to the scholar who prepared
No. 1 for the maternal eye, and to whose corrections of <div class="bookquote">``who''  (<font color='red'><b>the scholar</b></font>)</div>and <div class="bookquote">``whom''
 (<font color='red'><b>the scholar</b></font>)</div>Mr. Warrington did not pay very close attention. Who knows how he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>)
may have been disturbed? A pretty milliner may have attracted Harry's
attention out of window--a dancing bear with pipe and tabor may have
passed along the common--a jockey come under his (<font color='blue'><b>jockey</b></font>) windows to show off a
horse there? There are some days when any of us may be ungrammatical and
spell ill. Finally, suppose Harry did not care to spell so elegantly for
Mrs. Mountain as for his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) lady-mother, what affair is that of the
present biographer, century, reader? And as for your objection that Mr.
Warrington, in the above communication to his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) mother, showed some little
hypocrisy and reticence in his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) dealings with that venerable person, I
dare say, young folks, you in your time have written more than one prim
letter to your papas and mammas in which not quite all the transactions
of your lives were narrated, or if narrated, were exhibited in the most
favourable light for yourselves--I dare say, old folks! you, in your
time, were not altogether more candid. There must be a certain distance
between me and my son Jacky. There must be a respectful, an amiable, a
virtuous hypocrisy between us. I do not in the least wish that he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) should
treat me as his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) equal, that he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) should contradict me, take my arm-chair,
read the newspaper first at breakfast, ask unlimited friends to dine
when I have a party of my own, and so forth. No; where there is not
equality there must be hypocrisy. Continue to be blind to my faults; to
hush still as mice when I fall asleep after dinner; to laugh at my old
jokes; to admire my sayings; to be astonished at the impudence of those
unbelieving reviewers; to be dear filial humbugs, O my children! In my
castle I am king. Let all my royal household back before me. `Tis not
their natural way of walking, I know: but a decorous, becoming, and
modest behaviour highly agreeable to me. Away from me they may do, nay,
they do do, what they like. They may jump, skip, dance, trot, tumble
over heads and heels, and kick about freely, when they are out of the
presence of my majesty. Do not then, my dear young friends, be surprised
at your mother and aunt when they cry out, <div class="bookquote">``Oh, it was highly immoral
and improper of Mr. Warrington to be writing home humdrum demure letters
to his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) dear mamma, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) was playing all sorts of merry pranks!'' (<font color='red'><b>aunt</b></font>)</div>--but
drop a curtsey, and say, <div class="bookquote">``Yes, dear grandmamma -LRB-or aunt, as may be-RRB-,
it was very wrong of him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>): and I suppose you never had your fun when you
were young.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Of course, she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) didn't! And the sun never shone, and the
blossoms never budded, and the blood never danced, and the fiddles never
sang, in her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) spring-time. Eh, Babet! mon lait de poule et mon bonnet
de nuit! Ho, Betty! my gruel and my slippers! And go, ye frisky, merry
little souls! and dance, and have your merry little supper of cakes and
ale!




<p/>CHAPTER XXXI. The Bear and the Leader


<p/>Our candid readers know the real state of the case regarding Harry
Warrington and that luckless Cattarina; but a number of the old ladies
at Tunbridge Wells supposed the Virginian to be as dissipated as any
young English nobleman of the highest quality, and Madame de Bernstein
was especially incredulous about her (<font color='blue'><b>Betty</b></font>) nephew's innocence. It was the old
lady's firm belief that Harry was leading not only a merry life, but a
wicked one, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Betty</b></font>) wish was father to the thought that the lad might
be no better than his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) neighbours. An old Roman herself, she (<font color='blue'><b>Betty</b></font>) liked her (<font color='blue'><b>Betty</b></font>)
nephew to do as Rome did. All the scandal regarding Mr. Warrington's
Lovelace adventures she (<font color='blue'><b>Betty</b></font>) eagerly and complacently accepted. We have seen
how, on one or two occasions, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lovelace</b></font>) gave tea and music to the company at
the Wells; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Wells</b></font>) was so gallant and amiable to the ladies -LRB-to ladies of
a much better figure and character than the unfortunate Cattarina-RRB-, that
Madame Bernstein ceased to be disquieted regarding the silly love affair
which had had a commencement at Castlewood, and relaxed in her (<font color='blue'><b>Betty</b></font>) vigilance
over Lady Maria. Some folks--many old folks--are too selfish to interest
themselves long about the affairs of their neighbours. The Baroness had
her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) trumps to think of, her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) dinners, her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) twinges of rheumatism: and her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>)
suspicions regarding Maria and Harry, lately so lively, now dozed, and
kept a careless, unobservant watch. She (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) may have thought that the danger
was over, or she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) may have ceased to care whether it existed or not, or
that artful Maria, by her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) conduct, may have quite cajoled, soothed, and
misguided the old Dragon, to whose charge she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) was given over. At Maria's
age, nay, earlier indeed, maidens have learnt to be very sly, and at
Madame Bernstein's time of life dragons are not so fierce and alert.
They cannot turn so readily, some of their old teeth have dropped out,
and their eyes require more sleep than they needed in days when they
were more active, venomous, and dangerous. I, for my part, know a few
female dragons, de par le monde, and, as I watch them and remember what
they were, admire the softening influence of years upon these whilom
destroyers of man- and woman-kind. Their scales are so soft that any
knight with a moderate power of thrust can strike them: their claws,
once strong enough to tear out a thousand eyes, only fall with a feeble
pat that scarce raises the skin: their tongues, from their toothless old
gums, dart a venom which is rather disagreeable than deadly. See them
trailing their languid tails, and crawling home to their caverns
at roosting-time! How weak are their powers of doing injury! their
maleficence how feeble! How changed are they since the brisk days when
their eyes shot wicked fire; their tongue spat poison; their breath
blasted reputation; and they gobbled up a daily victim at least!

<p/>If the good folks at Oakhurst could not resist the testimony which
was brought to them regarding Harry's ill-doings, why should Madame
Bernstein, who in the course of her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) long days had had more experience of
evil than all the Oakhurst family put together, be less credulous
than they? Of course every single old woman of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) ladyship's society
believed every story that was told about Mr. Harry Warrington's
dissipated habits, and was ready to believe as much more ill of him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) as
you please. When the little dancer went back to London, as she (<font color='blue'><b>dancer</b></font>) did,
it was because that heartless Harry deserted her (<font color='blue'><b>dancer</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) deserted her (<font color='blue'><b>dancer</b></font>) for
somebody else, whose name was confidently given,--whose name?--whose
half-dozen names the society at Tunbridge Wells would whisper about;
where there congregated people of all ranks and degrees, women of
fashion, women of reputation, of demi-reputation, of virtue, of no
virtue,--all mingling in the same rooms, dancing to the same fiddles,
drinking out of the same glasses at the Wells, and alike in search of
health, or society, or pleasure. A century ago, and our ancestors, the
most free or the most straitlaced, met together at a score of such merry
places as that where our present scene lies, and danced, and frisked,
and gamed, and drank at Epsom, Bath, Tunbridge, Harrogate, as they do at
Homburg and Baden now.

<p/>Harry's bad reputation, then, comforted his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) old aunt exceedingly, and
eased her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) mind in respect to the boy's passion for Lady Maria. So easy
was she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) mind, that when the chaplain said he (<font color='blue'><b>chaplain</b></font>) came to escort
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) ladyship home, Madame Bernstein did not even care to part from her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>)
niece. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) preferred rather to keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) under her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) eye, to talk to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>)
about her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) wicked young cousin's wild extravagances, to whisper to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>)
that boys would be boys, to confide to Maria her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) intention of getting
a proper wife for Harry,--some one of a suitable age,--some one with a
suitable fortune,--all which pleasantries poor Maria had to bear with as
much fortitude as she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) could muster.

<p/>There lived, during the last century, a certain French duke and marquis,
who distinguished himself in Europe, and America likewise, and has
obliged posterity by leaving behind him (<font color='blue'><b>marquis</b></font>) a choice volume of memoirs,
which the gentle reader is specially warned not to consult. Having
performed the part of Don Juan in his (<font color='blue'><b>Juan</b></font>) own country, in ours, and in
other parts of Europe, he (<font color='blue'><b>Juan</b></font>) has kindly noted down the names of many
court-beauties who fell victims to his (<font color='blue'><b>Juan</b></font>) powers of fascination; and very
pleasant reading no doubt it must be for the grandsons and descendants
of the fashionable persons amongst whom our brilliant nobleman moved,
to find the names of their ancestresses adorning M. le Duc's sprightly
pages, and their frailties recorded by the candid writer who caused
them.

<p/>In the course of the peregrinations of this nobleman, he (<font color='blue'><b>nobleman</b></font>) visited North
America, and, as had been his (<font color='blue'><b>nobleman</b></font>) custom in Europe, proceeded straightway to
fall in love. And curious it is to contrast the elegant refinements of
European society, where, according to monseigneur, he (<font color='blue'><b>nobleman</b></font>) had but to lay
siege to a woman in order to vanquish her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), with the simple lives and
habits of the colonial folks, amongst whom this European enslaver of
hearts did not, it appears, make a single conquest. Had he (<font color='blue'><b>nobleman</b></font>) done so, he (<font color='blue'><b>nobleman</b></font>)
would as certainly have narrated his (<font color='blue'><b>nobleman</b></font>) victories in Pennsylvania and New
England, as he (<font color='blue'><b>nobleman</b></font>) described his (<font color='blue'><b>nobleman</b></font>) successes in this and his (<font color='blue'><b>nobleman</b></font>) own country.
Travellers in America have cried out quite loudly enough against the
rudeness and barbarism of transatlantic manners; let the present writer
give the humble testimony of his (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) experience that the conversation of
American gentlemen is generally modest, and, to the best of his (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) belief,
the lives of the women pure.

<p/>We have said that Mr. Harry Warrington brought his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) colonial modesty
along with him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) to the old country; and though he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) could not help hearing
the free talk of the persons amongst whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) lived, and who were men
of pleasure and the world, he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) sat pretty silent himself in the midst of
their rattle; never indulged in double entendre in his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) conversation
with women; had no victories over the sex to boast of; and was shy and
awkward when he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) heard such narrated by others.

<p/>This youthful modesty Mr. Sampson had remarked during his (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) intercourse
with the lad at Castlewood, where Mr. Warrington had more than once
shown himself quite uneasy whilst cousin Will was telling some of his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>)
choice stories; and my lord had curtly rebuked his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) brother, bidding
him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) keep his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) jokes for the usher's table at Kensington, and not give
needless offence to their kinsman. Hence the exclamation of <div class="bookquote">``Reverentia
pueris,''  (<font color='red'><b>the chaplain</b></font>)</div>which the chaplain had addressed to his (<font color='blue'><b>chaplain</b></font>) neighbour at the
ordinary on Harry's first appearance there. Mr. Sampson, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) had not
strength sufficient to do right himself, at least had grace enough not
to offend innocent young gentlemen by his (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) cynicism.

<p/>The chaplain was touched by Harry's gift of the horse; and felt a
genuine friendliness towards the lad. <div class="bookquote">``You see, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>says he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``I am of
the world, and must do as the rest of the world does. I have led a rough
life, Mr. Warrington, and can't afford to be more particular than my
neighbours. Video meliora, deteriora sequor, as we said at college. I
have got a little sister, who is at boarding-school, not very far from
here, and, as I keep a decent tongue in my head when I am talking with
my little Patty, and expect others to do as much, sure I may try and do
as much by you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The chaplain was loud in his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) praises of Harry to his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) aunt, the old
Baroness. She (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) liked to hear him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) praised. She (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) was as fond of him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>)
could be of anything; was pleased in his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) company, with his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) good looks,
his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) manly courageous bearing, his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) blushes, which came so readily, his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>)
bright eyes, his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) deep youthful voice. His (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) shrewdness and simplicity
constantly amused her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) would have wearied of him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) long before, had he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>)
been clever, or learned, or witty, or other than he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) was. <div class="bookquote">``We must find
a good wife for him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>), Chaplain,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) said to Mr. Sampson. <div class="bookquote">``I have one or
two in my eye, who, I think, will suit him (<font color='blue'><b>Chaplain</b></font>). We must set him (<font color='blue'><b>Chaplain</b></font>) up here;
he (<font color='blue'><b>Chaplain</b></font>) never will bear going back to his (<font color='blue'><b>Chaplain</b></font>) savages again, or to live with his (<font color='blue'><b>Chaplain</b></font>)
little Methodist of a mother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sampson/Mr. Sampson</b></font>)</div><p/>Now about this point Mr. Sampson, too, was personally anxious, and
had also a wife in his (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) eye for Harry. I suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) must have had some
conversations with his (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) lord at Castlewood, whom we have heard expressing
some intention of complimenting his (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) chaplain with a good living or other
provision, in event of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) being able to carry out his (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) lordship's wishes
regarding a marriage for Lady Maria. If his (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) good offices could help that
anxious lady to a husband, Sampson was ready to employ them: and he (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) now
waited to see in what most effectual manner he (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) could bring his (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) influence
to bear.

<p/>Sampson's society was most agreeable, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) young friend were
intimate in the course of a few hours. The parson rejoiced in
high spirits, good appetite, good humour; pretended to no sort of
squeamishness, and indulged in no sanctified hypocritical conversation;
nevertheless, he (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) took care not to shock his (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) young friend by any needless
outbreaks of levity or immorality of talk, initiating his (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) pupil, perhaps
from policy, perhaps from compunction, only into the minor mysteries,
as it were; and not telling him (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) the secrets with which the unlucky adept
himself was only too familiar. With Harry, Sampson was only a brisk,
lively, jolly companion, ready for any drinking bout, or any sport, a
cock-fight, a shooting-match, a game at cards, or a gallop across the
common; but his (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) conversation was decent, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) tried much more to
amuse the young man, than to lead him (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) astray. The chaplain was quite
successful: he (<font color='blue'><b>chaplain</b></font>) had immense animal spirits as well as natural wit, and
aptitude as well as experience in that business of toad-eater which
had been his (<font color='blue'><b>chaplain</b></font>) calling and livelihood from his (<font color='blue'><b>chaplain</b></font>) very earliest years,--ever
since he (<font color='blue'><b>chaplain</b></font>) first entered college as a servitor, and cast about to see by
whose means he (<font color='blue'><b>chaplain</b></font>) could make his (<font color='blue'><b>chaplain</b></font>) fortune in life. That was but satire just
now, when we said there were no toad-eaters left in the world. There are
many men of Sampson's profession now, doubtless; nay, little boys at our
public schools are sent thither at the earliest age, instructed by their
parents, and put out apprentices to toad-eating. But the flattery is not
so manifest as it used to be a hundred years since. Young men and old
have hangers-on, and led captains, but they assume an appearance of
equality, borrow money, or swallow their toads in private, and walk
abroad arm-in-arm with the great man, and call him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) by his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) name without
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) title. In those good old times, when Harry Warrington first came
to Europe, a gentleman's toad-eater pretended to no airs of equality at
all; openly paid court to his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) patron, called him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) by that name to other
folks, went on his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) errands for him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>),--any sort of errands which the
patron might devise,--called him (<font color='blue'><b>patron</b></font>) sir in speaking to him (<font color='blue'><b>patron</b></font>), stood up in
his (<font color='blue'><b>patron</b></font>) presence until bidden to sit down, and flattered him (<font color='blue'><b>patron</b></font>) ex officio. Mr.
Sampson did not take the least shame in speaking of Harry as his (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) young
patron,--as a young Virginian nobleman recommended to him (<font color='blue'><b>nobleman</b></font>) by his (<font color='blue'><b>nobleman</b></font>) other
noble patron, the Earl of Castlewood. He (<font color='blue'><b>nobleman</b></font>) was proud of appearing at
Harry's side, and as his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) humble retainer, in public talked about him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) to
the company, gave orders to Harry's tradesmen, from whom, let us hope,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) received a percentage in return for his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) recommendations, performed
all the functions of aide-de-camp--others, if our young gentleman
demanded them from the obsequious divine, who had gaily discharged the
duties of ami du prince to ever so many young men of fashion, since
his (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) own entrance into the world. It must be confessed that, since his (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>)
arrival in Europe, Mr. Warrington had not been uniformly lucky in the
friendships which he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) had made.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What a reputation, sir, they have made for you in this place!''  (<font color='red'><b>Sampson/Mr. Sampson</b></font>)</div>cries
Mr. Sampson, coming back from the coffee-house to his (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) patron. <div class="bookquote">``Monsieur
de Richelieu was nothing to you!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How do you mean, Monsieur de Richelieu?--Never was at Minorca in my
life,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>says downright Harry, who had not heard of those victories at
home, which made the French duke famous.

<p/>Mr. Sampson explained. The pretty widow Patcham who had just arrived
was certainly desperate about Mr. Warrington: her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) way of going on at
the rooms, the night before, proved that. As for Mrs. Hooper, that was a
known case, and the Alderman had fetched his (<font color='blue'><b>Alderman</b></font>) wife back to London for no
other reason. It was the talk of the whole Wells.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who says so?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>cries out Harry, indignantly. <div class="bookquote">``I should like to meet the
man who dares say so, and confound the villain!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should not like to show him (<font color='blue'><b>villain</b></font>) to you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sampson/Mr. Sampson</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Sampson, laughing. <div class="bookquote">``It
might be the worse for him (<font color='blue'><b>villain</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's a shame to speak with such levity about the character of ladies or
of gentlemen either,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>continues Mr. Warrington, pacing up and down the
room in a fume.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So I told them,''  (<font color='red'><b>the chaplain</b></font>)</div>says the chaplain, wagging his (<font color='blue'><b>chaplain</b></font>) head and looking very
much moved and very grave, though, if the truth were known, it had never
come into his (<font color='blue'><b>chaplain</b></font>) mind at all to be angry at hearing charges of this nature
against Harry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's a shame, I say, to talk away the reputation of any man or woman as
people do here. Do you know, in our country, a fellow's ears would not
be safe; and a little before I left home, three brothers shot down a
man, for having spoken ill of their sister.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Serve the villain right!''  (<font color='red'><b>Sampson/Mr. Sampson</b></font>)</div>cries Sampson.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Already they have had that calumny about me set a-going here,
Sampson,--about me and the poor little French dancing-girl.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have heard,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sampson/Mr. Sampson</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Sampson, shaking powder out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) wig.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Wicked; wasn't it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Abominable.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They said the very same thing about my Lord March. Isn't it shameful?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed it is,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sampson/Mr. Sampson</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Sampson, preserving a face of wonderful
gravity.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know what I should do if these stories were to come to my
mother's ears. It would break her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) heart, I do believe it would. Why,
only a few days before you came, a military friend of mine, Mr. Wolfe,
told me how the most horrible lies were circulated about me. Good
heavens! What do they think a gentleman of my name and country can
be capable of--I a seducer of women? They might as well say I was a
horse-stealer or a housebreaker. I vow if I hear any man say so, I'll
have his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ears!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have read, sir, that the Grand Seignior of Turkey has bushels of ears
sometimes sent in to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Sampson/Mr. Sampson</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Sampson, laughing. <div class="bookquote">``If you took all
those that had heard scandal against you or others, what basketsful you
would fill!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And so I would, Sampson, as soon as look at `em:--any fellow's who said
a word against a lady or a gentleman of honour!''  (<font color='red'><b>the Virginian</b></font>)</div>cries the Virginian.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you'll go down to the Well, you'll find a harvest of `em. I just
came from there. It was the high tide of Scandal. Detraction was at its
height. And you may see the nymphas discentes and the aures satyrorum
acutas,''  (<font color='red'><b>the chaplain</b></font>)</div>cries the chaplain, with a shrug of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) shoulders.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That may be as you say, Sampson,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>Mr. Warrington replies, <div class="bookquote">``but if ever
I hear any man speak against my character I'll punish him (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>). Mark that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall be very sorry for his (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) sake, that I should; for you'll mark him (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>)
in a way he (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) won't like, sir; and I know you are a man of your word.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You may be sure of that, Sampson. And now shall we go to dinner, and
afterwards to my Lady Trumpington's tea?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You know, sir, I can't resist a card or a bottle,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sampson/Mr. Sampson</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Sampson.
<div class="bookquote">``Let us have the last first and then the first shall come last.''  (<font color='red'><b>this the gentlemen</b></font>)</div>And
with this the two gentlemen went off to their accustomed place of
refection.

<p/>That was an age in which wine-bibbing was more common than in our
politer time; and, especially since the arrival of General Braddock's
army in his (<font color='blue'><b>Braddock</b></font>) native country, our young Virginian had acquired rather
a liking for the filling of bumpers and the calling of toasts; having
heard that it was a point of honour among the officers never to decline
a toast or a challenge. So Harry and his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) chaplain drank their claret in
peace and plenty, naming, as the simple custom was, some favourite lady
with each glass.

<p/>The chaplain had reasons of his (<font color='blue'><b>chaplain</b></font>) own for desiring to know how far
the affair between Harry and my Lady Maria had gone; whether it was
advancing, or whether it was ended; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) young friend were
just warm enough with the claret to be able to talk with that great
eloquence, that candour, that admirable friendliness, which good wine
taken in rather injudicious quantity inspires. O kindly harvests of
the Aquitanian grape! O sunny banks of Garonne! O friendly caves of
Gledstane and Morol, where the dusky flasks lie recondite! May we not
say a word of thanks for all the pleasure we owe you? Are the Temperance
men to be allowed to shout in the public places? are the Vegetarians to
bellow <div class="bookquote">``Cabbage for ever?''  (<font color='red'><b>the Vegetarians</b></font>)</div>and may we modest Enophilists not sing the
praises of our favourite plant? After the drinking of good Bordeaux
wine, there is a point -LRB-I do not say a pint-RRB- at which men arrive, when
all the generous faculties of the soul are awakened and in full vigour;
when the wit brightens and breaks out in sudden flashes; when the
intellects are keenest; when the pent-up words and confined thoughts get
a night-rule, and rush abroad and disport themselves; when the kindliest
affection, come out and shake hands with mankind, and the timid Truth
jumps up naked out of his (<font color='blue'><b>men</b></font>) well and proclaims himself to all the world.
How, by the kind influence of the wine-cup, we succour the poor and
humble! How bravely we rush to the rescue of the oppressed! I say, in
the face of all the pumps which ever spouted, that there is a moment in
a bout of good wine at which, if a man could but remain, wit, wisdom,
courage, generosity, eloquence, happiness were his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>); but the moment
passes, and that other glass somehow spoils the state of beatitude.
There is a headache in the morning; we are not going into Parliament
for our native town; we are not going to shoot those French officers
who have been speaking disrespectfully of our country; and poor Jeremy
Diddler calls about eleven o’clock for another half-sovereign, and we
are unwell in bed, and can't see him (<font color='blue'><b>Jeremy</b></font>), and send him (<font color='blue'><b>Jeremy</b></font>) empty away.

<p/>Well, then, as they sate over their generous cups, the company having
departed, and the bottle of claret being brought in by Monsieur Barbeau,
the chaplain found himself in an eloquent state, with a strong desire
for inculcating sublime moral precepts whilst Harry was moved by an
extreme longing to explain his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) whole private history, and to impart all
his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) present feelings to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) new friend. Mark that fact. Why must a
man say everything that comes uppermost in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) noble mind, because,
forsooth, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has swallowed a half-pint more wine than he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ordinarily
drinks? Suppose I had committed a murder -LRB-of course I allow the sherry,
and champagne at dinner-RRB-, should I announce that homicide somewhere
about the third bottle -LRB-in a small party of men-RRB- of claret at dessert?
Of course: and hence the fidelity to water-gruel announced a few pages
back.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am glad to hear what your conduct has really been with regard to the
Cattarina, Mr. Warrington; I am glad from my soul,''  (<font color='red'><b>the chaplain</b></font>)</div>says the impetuous
chaplain. <div class="bookquote">``The wine is with you. You have shown that you can bear down
calumny, and resist temptation. Ah! my dear sir, men are not all so
fortunate. What famous good wine this is!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>chaplain</b></font>) sucks up a glass with
<div class="bookquote">``A toast from you, my dear sir, if you please?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>``I give you `Miss Fanny Mountain, of Virginia,''' says Mr. Warrington,
filling a bumper as his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) thoughts fly straightway, ever so many thousand
miles, to home.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``One of your American conquests, I suppose?''  (<font color='red'><b>the chaplain</b></font>)</div>says the chaplain.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) is but ten years old, and I have never made any conquests at
all in Virginia, Mr. Sampson,''  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>says the young gentleman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are like a true gentleman, and don't kiss and tell, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I neither kiss nor tell. It isn't the custom of our country, Sampson,
to ruin girls, or frequent the society of low women. We Virginian
gentlemen honour women: we don't wish to bring them to shame,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>cries the
young toper, looking very proud and handsome. <div class="bookquote">``The young lady whose
name I mentioned hath lived in our family since her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) infancy, and I would
shoot the man who did her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) a wrong;--by Heaven, I would!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Your sentiments do you honour! Let me shake hands with you! I will
shake hands with you, Mr. Warrington,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sampson/Mr. Sampson</b></font>)</div>cried the enthusiastic Sampson.
<div class="bookquote">``And let me tell you `tis the grasp of honest friendship offered you,
and not merely the poor retainer paying court to the wealthy patron. No!
with such liquor as this, all men are equal;--faith, all men are rich,

honour with all the acres of your principality!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Let us have another bottle of riches,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>says Harry, with a laugh.
<div class="bookquote">``Encore du cachet jaune, mon bon Monsieur Barbeau!''  (<font color='red'><b>Monsieur Barbeau/Barbeau</b></font>)</div>and exit Monsieur
Barbeau to the caves below.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Another bottle of riches! Capital, capital! How beautifully you speak
French, Mr. Harry!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do speak it well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>says Harry. <div class="bookquote">``At least, when I speak, Monsieur
Barbeau understands me well enough.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You do everything well, I think. You succeed in whatever you try. That

sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There you go again about the women! I tell you I don't like these
stories about women. Confound me, Sampson, why is a gentleman's
character to be blackened so?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, at any rate, there is one, unless my eyes deceive me very much
indeed, sir!''  (<font color='red'><b>the chaplain</b></font>)</div>cries the chaplain.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Whom do you mean?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>asked Harry, flushing very red.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, I name no names. It isn't for a poor chaplain to meddle with his (<font color='blue'><b>chaplain</b></font>)
betters' doings, or to know their thoughts,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sampson/Mr. Sampson</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Sampson.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thoughts! what thoughts, Sampson?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I fancied I saw, on the part of a certain lovely and respected lady at
Castlewood, a preference exhibited. I fancied, on the side of a certain

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have watched it this month past,''  (<font color='red'><b>the chaplain</b></font>)</div>says the chaplain.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Confound me, sir, do you mean you have been a spy on me?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>says the
other hotly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A spy! You made little disguise of the matter, Mr. Warrington, and
her (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) ladyship wasn't a much better hand at deceiving. You were always
together. In the shrubberies, in the walks, in the village, in the
galleries of the house,--you always found a pretext for being together,
and plenty of eyes besides mine watched you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Gracious powers! What did you see, Sampson?''  (<font color='red'><b>the lad</b></font>)</div>cries the lad.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, sir, `tis forbidden to kiss and tell. I say so again,''  (<font color='red'><b>the chaplain</b></font>)</div>says the
chaplain.

<p/>The young man turned very red. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, Sampson!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cried, <div class="bookquote">``can I--can I
confide in you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dearest sir--dear generous youth--you know I would shed my heart's
blood for you!''  (<font color='red'><b>the chaplain</b></font>)</div>exclaimed the chaplain, squeezing his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) patron's hand, and
turning a brilliant pair of eyes ceilingwards.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Sampson! I tell you I am miserable. With all this play and wine,
whilst I have been here, I tell you I have been trying to drive away
care. I own to you that when we were at Castlewood there were things
passed between a certain lady and me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The parson</b></font>)</div><p/>The parson gave a slight whistle over his (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) glass of Bordeaux.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And they've made me wretched, those things have. I mean, you see, that
if a gentleman has given his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) word, why, it's his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) word, and he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) must stand
by it, you know. I mean that I thought I loved her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>),--and so I do very
much, and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)'s a most dear, kind, darling, affectionate creature, and
very handsome, too,--quite beautiful; but then, you know, our ages,
Sampson! Think of our ages, Sampson! She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)'s as old as my mother!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who would never forgive you.''

oh, hang it! Why did Aunt Bernstein tell me--?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell you what?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Something I can't divulge to anybody, something that tortures me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not about the--the--''  (<font color='red'><b>the chaplain</b></font>)</div>the chaplain paused: he (<font color='blue'><b>chaplain</b></font>) was going to say about
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) ladyship's little affair with the French dancing-master; about other
little anecdotes affecting her (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) character. But he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) had not drunk wine
enough to be quite candid, or too much, and was past the real moment of
virtue.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, yes, every one of `em false--every one of `em!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>shrieks out Harry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Great powers, what do you mean?''  (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div>asks his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) friend.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``These, sir, these!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>says Harry, beating a tattoo on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) own white
teeth. <div class="bookquote">``I didn't know it when I asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>). I swear I didn't know it.
Oh, it's horrible--it's horrible! and it has caused me nights of agony,
Sampson. My dear old grandfather had a set a Frenchman at Charleston
made them for him (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>), and we used to look at `em grinning in a tumbler, and
when they were out, his (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) jaws used to fall in--I never thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) had
`em.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Had what, sir?''  (<font color='red'><b>the chaplain</b></font>)</div>again asked the chaplain.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Confound it, sir, don't you see I mean teeth?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>says Harry, rapping the
table.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, only two.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And how the devil do you know, sir?''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>asks the young man, fiercely.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I--I had it from her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) maid. She (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) had two teeth knocked out by a stone
which cut her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) lip a little, and they have been replaced.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Sampson, do you mean to say they ain't all sham ones?''  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div>cries the
boy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But two, sir, at least so Peggy told me, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Peggy</b></font>) would just as soon
have blabbed about the whole two-and-thirty--the rest are as sound as
yours, which are beautiful.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And her (<font color='blue'><b>Peggy</b></font>) hair, Sampson, is that all right, too?''  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>asks the young
gentleman.

<p/>```Tis lovely--I have seen that. I can take my oath to that. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) ladyship
can sit upon it; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) figure is very fine; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) skin is as white
as snow; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) heart is the kindest that ever was; and I know, that is
I feel sure, it is very tender about you, Mr. Warrington.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Sampson! Heaven, Heaven bless you! What a weight you've taken off
my mind with those--those--never mind them! Oh, Sam! How happy--that is,
no, no--ob, how miserable I am! She (<font color='blue'><b>Peggy</b></font>)'s as old as Madam Esmond--by George
she (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) is--she (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>)'s as old as my mother. You wouldn't have a fellow marry
a woman as old as his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) mother? It's too bad: by George it is. It's too
bad.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>And here, I am sorry to say, Harry Esmond Warrington, Esquire, of
Castlewood, in Virginia, began to cry. The delectable point, you see,
must have been passed several glasses ago.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't want to marry her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), then?''  (<font color='red'><b>the chaplain</b></font>)</div>asks the chaplain.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What's that to you, sir? I've promised her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), and an Esmond--a Virginia
Esmond mind that--Mr. What's-your-name--Sampson--has but his (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) word!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>The sentiment was noble, but delivered by Harry with rather a doubtful
articulation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mind you, I said a Virginia Esmond,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>continued poor Harry, lifting up
his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) finger. <div class="bookquote">``I don't mean the younger branch here. I don't mean Will,
who robbed me about the horse, and whose bones I'll break. I give you
Lady Maria--Heaven bless her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>), and Heaven bless you, Sampson, and you
deserve to be a bishop, old boy!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There are letters between you, I suppose?''  (<font color='red'><b>Sampson/Mr. Sampson</b></font>)</div>says Sampson.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Letters! Dammy, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>)'s always writing me letters!--never lets me into a
window but she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) sticks one in my cuff. Letters! that is a good idea! Look
here! Here's letters!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) threw down a pocket-book containing a heap
of papers of the poor lady's composition.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Those are letters, indeed. What a post-bag!''  (<font color='red'><b>the chaplain</b></font>)</div>says the chaplain.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But any man who touches them--dies--dies on the spot!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>shrieks Harry,
starting from his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) seat, and reeling towards his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) sword; which he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) draws,
and then stamps with his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) foot, and says, <div class="bookquote">``Ha! ha!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and then lunges at
M. Barbeau, who skips away from the lunge behind the chaplain, who looks
rather alarmed. I know we could have had a much more exciting picture
than either of those we present of Harry this month, and the lad, with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hair dishevelled, raging about the room flamberge au vent, and
pinking the affrighted innkeeper and chaplain, would have afforded a
good subject for the pencil. But oh, to think of him (<font color='blue'><b>chaplain</b></font>) stumbling over a
stool, and prostrated by an enemy who has stole away his (<font color='blue'><b>chaplain</b></font>) brains! Come,
Gumbo! and help your master to bed!




<p/>CHAPTER XXXII. In which a Family Coach is ordered


<p/>Our pleasing duty now is to divulge the secret which Mr. Lambert
whispered in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) wife's ear at the close of the antepenultimate chapter,
and the publication of which caused such great pleasure to the whole of
the Oakhurst family. As the hay was in, the corn not ready for cutting,
and by consequence the farm horses disengaged, why, asked Colonel
Lambert, should they not be put into the coach, and should we not all
pay a visit to Tunbridge Wells, taking friend Wolfe at Westerham on our
way?

<p/>Mamma embraced this proposal, and I dare say the honest gentleman who
made it. All the children jumped for joy. The girls went off straightway
to get together their best calamancoes, paduasoys, falbalas, furbelows,
capes, cardinals, sacks, negligees, solitaires, caps, ribbons, mantuas,
clocked stockings, and high-heeled shoes, and I know not what articles
of toilet. Mamma's best robes were taken from the presses, whence they
only issued on rare, solemn occasions, retiring immediately afterwards
to lavender and seclusion; the brave Colonel produced his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) laced hat and
waistcoat and silver-hilted hanger; Charley rejoiced in a rasee holiday
suit of his (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) father's, in which the Colonel had been married, and which
Mrs. Lambert cut up, not without a pang. Ball and Dumpling had their
tails and manes tied with ribbon, and Chump, the old white cart-horse,
went as unicorn leader, to help the carriage-horses up the first hilly
five miles of the road from Oakhurst to Westerham. The carriage was an
ancient vehicle, and was believed to have served in the procession which
had brought George I. from Greenwich to London, on his (<font color='blue'><b>I.</b></font>) first arrival to
assume the sovereignty of these realms. It had belonged to Mr. Lambert's
father, and the family had been in the habit of regarding it, ever since
they could remember anything, as one of the most splendid coaches in the
three kingdoms. Brian, coachman, and--must it also be owned?--ploughman,
of the Oakhurst family, had a place on the box, with Mr. Charley by his (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>)
side. The precious clothes were packed in imperials on the roof. The
Colonel's pistols were put in the pockets of the carriage, and the
blunderbuss hung behind the box, in reach of Brian, who was an old
soldier. No highwayman, however, molested the convoy; not even an
innkeeper levied contributions on Colonel Lambert, who, with a slender
purse and a large family, was not to be plundered by those or any other
depredators on the king's highway; and a reasonable cheap modest lodging
had been engaged for them by young Colonel Wolfe, at the house where he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>)
was in the habit of putting up, and whither he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) himself accompanied them
on horseback.

<p/>It happened that these lodgings were opposite Madame Bernstein's; and as
the Oakhurst family reached their quarters on a Saturday evening, they
could see chair after chair discharging powdered beaux and patched and
brocaded beauties at the Baroness's door, who was holding one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>)
many card-parties. The sun was not yet down -LRB-for our ancestors began
their dissipations at early hours, and were at meat, drink, or cards,
any time after three o’clock in the afternoon until any time in the
night or morning-RRB-, and the young country ladies and their mother from
their window could see the various personages as they passed into the
Bernstein rout. Colonel Wolfe told the ladies who most of the characters
were. `Twas almost as delightful as going to the party themselves, Hetty
and Theo thought, for they not only could see the guests arriving, but
look into the Baroness's open casements and watch many of them there. Of
a few of the personages we have before had a glimpse. When the Duchess
of Queensberry passed, and Mr. Wolfe explained who she (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>) was, Martin
Lambert was ready with a score of lines about <div class="bookquote">``Kitty, beautiful and
young,''  (<font color='red'><b>Martin/Martin Lambert</b></font>)</div>from his (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) favourite Mat Prior.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Think that that old lady was once like you, girls!''  (<font color='red'><b>the Colonel</b></font>)</div>cries the Colonel.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Like us, papa? Well, certainly we never set up for being beauties!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hetty/Miss Hetty/Lambert</b></font>)</div>says Miss Hetty, tossing up her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) little head.

<p/>``Yes, like you, you little baggage; like you at this moment, who want to
go to that drum yonder:--

<p/>`Inflamed with rage at sad restraint
Which wise mamma ordained,
And sorely vexed to play the saint
Whilst wit and beauty reigned.'''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We were never invited, papa; and I am sure if there's no beauty more
worth seeing than that, the wit can't be much worth the hearing,''  (<font color='red'><b>the satirist</b></font>)</div>again
says the satirist of the family.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, but he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>)'s a rare poet, Mat Prior!''  (<font color='red'><b>the Colonel</b></font>)</div>continues the Colonel; ``though,
mind you, girls, you'll skip over all the poems I have marked with a
cross. A rare poet! and to think you should see one of his (<font color='blue'><b>poet</b></font>) heroines!
`Fondness prevailed, mamma gave way' -LRB-she (<font color='blue'><b>saint</b></font>) always will, Mrs. Lambert!-RRB---

<p/>`Fondness prevailed, mamma gave way,
Kitty at heart's desire
Obtained the chariot for a day,
And set the world on fire!'''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sure it must have been very inflammable,''  (<font color='red'><b>mamma</b></font>)</div>says mamma.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So it was, my dear, twenty years ago, much more inflammable than it is
now,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Colonel</b></font>)</div>remarks the Colonel.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nonsense, Mr. Lambert,''  (<font color='red'><b>mamma</b></font>)</div>is mamma's answer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Look, look!''  (<font color='red'><b>Hetty/Miss Hetty/Lambert</b></font>)</div>cries Hetty, running forward and pointing to the little
square, and the covered gallery, where was the door leading to Madame
Bernstein's apartments, and round which stood a crowd of street urchins,
idlers, and yokels, watching the company.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's Harry Warrington!''  (<font color='red'><b>Theo/Lady Theo</b></font>)</div>exclaims Theo, waving a handkerchief to the
young Virginian: but Warrington did not see Miss Lambert. The Virginian
was walking arm-in-arm with a portly clergyman in a crisp rustling silk
gown, and the two went into Madame de Bernstein's door.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) preach a most admirable sermon here last Sunday,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wolfe/Wolfe</b></font>)</div>says Mr.
Wolfe; <div class="bookquote">``a little theatrical, but most striking and eloquent.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wolfe/Wolfe</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You seem to be here most Sundays, James,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Lambert/Lambert</b></font>)</div>says Mrs. Lambert.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And Monday, and soon till Saturday,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Colonel</b></font>)</div>adds the Colonel. <div class="bookquote">``See, Harry has
beautified himself already, hath his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hair in buckle, and I have no doubt
is going to the drum too.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I had rather sit quiet generally of a Saturday evening,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wolfe/Wolfe</b></font>)</div>says sober Mr.
Wolfe; <div class="bookquote">``at any rate, away from card-playing and scandal; but I own, dear
Mrs. Lambert, I am under orders. Shall I go across the way and send Mr.
Warrington to you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wolfe/Wolfe</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, let him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) have his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) sport. We shall see him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) to-morrow. He (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) won't care
to be disturbed amidst his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) fine folks by us country-people,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Lambert/Lambert</b></font>)</div>said meek
Mrs. Lambert.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am glad he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) is with a clergyman who preaches so well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Theo/Lady Theo</b></font>)</div>says Theo,
softly; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) eyes seemed to say, You see, good people, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wolfe</b></font>) is not so
bad as you thought him (<font color='blue'><b>Wolfe</b></font>), and as I, for my part, never believed him (<font color='blue'><b>Wolfe</b></font>) to be.
<div class="bookquote">``The clergyman has a very kind, handsome face.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Here comes a greater clergyman,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wolfe/Wolfe</b></font>)</div>cries Mr. Wolfe. <div class="bookquote">``It is my Lord of
Salisbury, with his (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) blue ribbon, and a chaplain behind him (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And whom a mercy's name have we here?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Lambert/Lambert</b></font>)</div>breaks in Mrs. Lambert, as a
sedan-chair, covered with gilding, topped with no less than five earl's
coronets, carried by bearers in richly laced clothes, and preceded by
three footmen in the same splendid livery, now came up to Madame de
Bernstein's door. The Bishop, who had been about to enter, stopped, and
ran back with the most respectful bows and curtseys to the sedan-chair,
giving his (<font color='blue'><b>Bishop</b></font>) hand to the lady who stepped thence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who on earth is this?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Lambert/Lambert</b></font>)</div>asks Mrs. Lambert.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sprechen sie Deutsch? Ja, meinherr. Nichts verstand,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Colonel</b></font>)</div>says the waggish
Colonel.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Pooh, Martin.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, if you can't understand High Dutch, my love, how can I help it?
Your education was neglected at school. Can you understand heraldry?--I
know you can.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I make.''  (<font color='red'><b>Charley</b></font>)</div>cries Charley, reciting the shield, <div class="bookquote">``three merions on a field
or, with an earl's coronet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charley</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A countess's coronet, my son. The Countess of Yarmouth, my son.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And pray who is she (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It hath ever been the custom of our sovereigns to advance persons
of distinction to honour,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Colonel</b></font>)</div>continues the Colonel, gravely, <div class="bookquote">``and this
eminent lady hath been so promoted by our gracious monarch, to the rank
of Countess of this kingdom.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Colonel</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But why, papa?''  (<font color='red'><b>the daughters</b></font>)</div>asked the daughters together.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Never mind, girls!''  (<font color='red'><b>mamma</b></font>)</div>said mamma.

<p/>But that incorrigible Colonel would go on.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Y, my children, is one of the last and the most awkward letters of the
whole alphabet. When I tell you stories, you are always saying Why. Why
should my Lord Bishop be cringing to that lady? Look at him (<font color='blue'><b>Bishop</b></font>) rubbing his (<font color='blue'><b>Bishop</b></font>)
fat hands together, and smiling into her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) face! It's not a handsome face
any longer. It is all painted red and white like Scaramouch's in the
pantomime. See, there comes another blue-riband, as I live. My Lord
Bamborough. The descendant of the Hotspurs. The proudest man in England.
He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stops, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) bows, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) smiles; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is hat in hand, too. See, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) taps him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) fan. Get away, you crowd of little blackguard boys, and don't
tread on the robe of the lady whom the King delights to honour.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But why does the King honour her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>the girls</b></font>)</div>ask the girls once more.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There goes that odious last letter but one! Did you ever hear of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
Grace the Duchess of Kendal? No. Of the Duchess of Portsmouth? Non plus.
Of the Duchess of La Valliore? Of Fair Rosamond, then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hush, papa! There is no need to bring blushes on the cheeks of my
dear ones, Martin Lambert!''  (<font color='red'><b>the mother</b></font>)</div>said the mother, putting her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) finger to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
husband's lips.

<p/>```Tis not I; it is their sacred Majesties who are the cause of the
shame,'' cries the son of the old republican. <div class="bookquote">``Think of the bishops of
the Church and the proudest nobility of the world cringing and bowing
before that painted High Dutch Jezebel. Oh, it's a shame! a shame!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Confusion!''  (<font color='red'><b>Colonel</b></font>)</div>here broke out Colonel Wolfe, and making a dash at his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) hat,
ran from the room. He (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) had seen the young lady whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) admired and her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
guardian walking across the Pantiles on foot to the Baroness's party,
and they came up whilst the Countess of Yarmouth-Walmoden was engaged
in conversation with the two lords spiritual and temporal, and these two
made the lowest reverences and bows to the Countess, and waited until
she (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) had passed in at the door on the Bishop's arm.

<p/>Theo turned away from the window with a sad, almost awestricken face.
Hetty still remained there, looking from it with indignation in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
eyes, and a little red spot on each cheek.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A penny for little Hetty's thoughts,''  (<font color='red'><b>mamma</b></font>)</div>says mamma, coming to the window
to lead the child away.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am thinking what I should do if I saw papa bowing to that woman,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hetty/Miss Hetty/Lambert</b></font>)</div>says Hetty.

<p/>Tea and a hissing kettle here made their appearance, and the family sate
down to partake of their evening meal,--leaving, however, Miss Hetty,
from her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) place, command of the window, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) begged her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) brother
not to close. That young gentleman had been down amongst the crowd to
inspect the armorial bearings of the Countess's and other sedans, no
doubt, and also to invest sixpence in a cheese-cake, by mamma's order
and his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) own desire, and he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) returned presently with this delicacy wrapped
up in a paper.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Look, mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) comes back and says, <div class="bookquote">``do you see that big man in
brown beating all the pillars with a stick? That is the learned Mr.
Johnson. He (<font color='blue'><b>Johnson</b></font>) comes to the Friars sometimes to see our master. He (<font color='blue'><b>Johnson</b></font>) was
sitting with some friends just now at the tea-table before Mrs. Brown's
tart-shop. They have tea there, twopence a cup; I heard Mr. Johnson say
he (<font color='blue'><b>Johnson</b></font>) had had seventeen cups--that makes two-and-tenpence--what a sight of
money for tea!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What would you have, Charley?''  (<font color='red'><b>Theo/Lady Theo</b></font>)</div>asks Theo.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think I would have cheese-cakes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charley</b></font>)</div>says Charley, sighing, as his (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) teeth
closed on a large slice, <div class="bookquote">``and the gentleman whom Mr. Johnson was with,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Charley</b></font>)</div>continues Charley, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) mouth quite full, <div class="bookquote">``was Mr. Richardson who
wrote--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charley</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Clarissa!''  (<font color='red'><b>Charley</b></font>)</div>cry all the women in a breath, and run to the window to see
their favourite writer. By this time the sun was sunk, the stars were
twinkling overhead, and the footman came and lighted the candles in the
Baroness's room opposite our spies.

<p/>Theo and her (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) mother were standing together looking from their place of
observation. There was a small illumination at Mrs. Brown's tart-
and tea-shop, by which our friends could see one lady getting Mr.
Richardson's hat and stick, and another tying a shawl round his (<font color='blue'><b>Richardson</b></font>) neck,
after which he (<font color='blue'><b>Richardson</b></font>) walked home.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh dear me! he (<font color='blue'><b>Richardson</b></font>) does not look like Grandison!''  (<font color='red'><b>Theo</b></font>)</div>cries Theo.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I rather think I wish we had not seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Richardson</b></font>), my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>mamma</b></font>)</div>says mamma, who
has been described as a most sentimental woman and eager novel-reader;
and here again they were interrupted by Miss Hetty, who cried:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Never mind that little fat man, but look yonder, mamma.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hetty/Miss Hetty/Lambert</b></font>)</div><p/>And they looked yonder. And they saw, in the first place, Mr. Warrington
undergoing the honour of a presentation to the Countess of Yarmouth, who
was still followed by the obsequious peer and prelate with blue ribands.
And now the Countess graciously sate down to a card-table, the Bishop
and the Earl and a fourth person being her (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) partners. And now Mr.
Warrington came into the embrasure of the window with a lady whom they
recognised as the lady whom they had seen for a few minutes at Oakhurst.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How much finer he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is!''  (<font color='red'><b>remarks mamma</b></font>)</div>remarks mamma.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is improved in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) looks! What has he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) done to himself?''  (<font color='red'><b>Theo/Lady Theo</b></font>)</div>asks
Theo.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Look at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) grand lace frills and rules! My dear, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has not got on our
shirts any more,''  (<font color='red'><b>the matron</b></font>)</div>cries the matron.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What are you talking about, girls?''  (<font color='red'><b>papa</b></font>)</div>asks papa, reclining on his (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) sofa,
where, perhaps, he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) was dozing after the fashion of honest house-fathers.

<p/>The girls said how Harry Warrington was in the window, talking with his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>)
cousin Lady Maria Esmond.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come away!''  (<font color='red'><b>papa</b></font>)</div>cries papa. <div class="bookquote">``You have no right to be spying the young
fellow. Down with the curtains, I say!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the girls</b></font>)</div><p/>And down the curtains went, so that the girls saw no more of Madame
Bernstein's guests or doings for that night.

<p/>I pray you be not angry at my remarking, if only by way of contrast
between these two opposite houses, that while Madame Bernstein and her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>)
guests--bishop, dignitaries, noblemen, and what not--were gambling or
talking scandal, or devouring champagne and chickens -LRB-which I hold to be
venial sin-RRB-, or doing honour to her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) ladyship the king's favourite, the
Countess of Yarmouth-Walmoden, our country friends in their lodgings
knelt round their table, whither Mr. Brian the coachman came as silently
as his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) creaking shoes would let him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>), whilst Mr. Lambert, standing up,
read in a low voice, a prayer that Heaven would lighten their darkness
and defend them from the perils of that night, and a supplication that
it would grant the request of those two or three gathered together.

<p/>Our young folks were up betimes on Sunday morning, and arrayed
themselves in those smart new dresses which were to fascinate the
Tunbridge folks, and, with the escort of brother Charley, paced the
little town, and the quaint Pantiles, and the pretty common, long ere
the company was at breakfast, or the bells had rung to church. It
was Hester who found out where Harry Warrington's lodging must be, by
remarking Mr. Gumbo in an undress, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Gumbo</b></font>) lovely hair in curl-papers,
drawing a pair of red curtains aside, and opening a window-sash, whence
he (<font color='blue'><b>Gumbo</b></font>) thrust his (<font color='blue'><b>Gumbo</b></font>) head and inhaled the sweet morning breeze. Mr. Gumbo did
not happen to see the young people from Oakhurst, though they beheld him (<font color='blue'><b>Gumbo</b></font>)
clearly enough. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gumbo</b></font>) leaned gracefully from the window; he (<font color='blue'><b>Gumbo</b></font>) waved a large
feather brush, with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Gumbo</b></font>) condescended to dust the furniture of
the apartment within; he (<font color='blue'><b>Gumbo</b></font>) affably engaged in conversation with a
cherry-cheeked milkmaid, who was lingering under the casement, and
kissed his (<font color='blue'><b>Gumbo</b></font>) lily hand to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gumbo</b></font>). Gumbo's hand sparkled with rings, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Gumbo</b></font>)
person was decorated with a profusion of jewellery--gifts, no doubt, of
the fair who appreciated the young African. Once or twice more before
breakfast-time the girls passed near that window. It remained opened,
but the room behind it was blank. No face of Harry Warrington appeared
there. Neither spoke to the other of the subject on which both were
brooding. Hetty was a little provoked with Charley, who was clamorous
about breakfast, and told him (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) was always thinking of eating. In reply
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) sarcastic inquiry, he (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) artlessly owned he (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) should like another
cheese-cake, and good-natured Theo, laughing, said she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) had a sixpence,
and if the cake-shop were open of a Sunday morning Charley should have
one. The cake-shop was open: and Theo took out her (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) little purse, netted
by her (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) dearest friend at school, and containing her (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) pocket-piece, her (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>)
grandmother's guinea, her (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) slender little store of shillings--nay, some
copper money at one end; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) treated Charley to the meal which he (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>)
loved.

<p/>A great deal of fine company was at church. There was that funny old
Duchess, and old Madame Bernstein, with Lady Maria at her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) side; and Mr.
Wolfe, of course, by the side of Miss Lowther, and singing with her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) out
of the same psalm-book; and Mr. Richardson with a bevy of ladies. One
of them is Miss Fielding, papa tells them after church, Harry Fielding's
sister. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, girls, what good company he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) was! And his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) books are worth
a dozen of your milksop Pamelas and Clarissas, Mrs. Lambert: but what
woman ever loved true humour? And there was Mr. Johnson sitting amongst
the charity children. Did you see how he (<font color='blue'><b>Johnson</b></font>) turned round to the altar
at the Belief, and upset two or three of the scared little urchins in
leather breeches? And what a famous sermon Harry's parson gave, didn't
he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)? A sermon about scandal. How, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) touched up some of the old harridans
who were seated round! Why wasn't Mr. Warrington at church? It was a
shame he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) wasn't at church.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I really did not remark whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) was there or not,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hetty/Miss Hetty/Lambert</b></font>)</div>says Miss Hetty,
tossing her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) head up.

<p/>But Theo, who was all truth, said, <div class="bookquote">``Yes, I thought of him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>), and was sorry
he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) was not there; and so did you think of him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>), Hetty.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Theo/Lady Theo</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I did no such thing, miss,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hetty/Miss Hetty/Lambert</b></font>)</div>persists Hetty.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then why did you whisper to me it was Harry's clergyman who preached?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To think of Mr. Warrington's clergyman is not to think of Mr.
Warrington. It was a most excellent sermon, certainly, and the children
sang most dreadfully out of tune. And there is Lady Maria at the window
opposite, smelling at the roses; and that is Mr. Wolfe's step, I know
his (<font color='blue'><b>Wolfe</b></font>) great military tramp. Right left--right left! How do you do, Colonel
Wolfe?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why do you look so glum, James?''  (<font color='red'><b>Colonel</b></font>)</div>asks Colonel Lambert, good-naturedly.
<div class="bookquote">``Has the charmer been scolding thee, or is thy conscience pricked by the
sermon. Mr. Sampson, isn't the parson's name? A famous preacher, on my
word!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A pretty preacher, and a pretty practitioner!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wolfe/Wolfe</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Wolfe, with a
shrug of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wolfe</b></font>) shoulders.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, I thought the discourse did not last ten minutes, and madam did
not sleep one single wink during the sermon, didst thou, Molly?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did you see when the fellow came into church?''  (<font color='red'><b>Colonel</b></font>)</div>asked the indignant
Colonel Wolfe. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) came in at the open door of the common, just in time,
and as the psalm was over.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) had been reading the service probably to some sick person;
there are many here,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Lambert/Lambert</b></font>)</div>remarks Mrs. Lambert.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Reading the service! Oh, my good Mrs. Lambert! Do you know where I
found him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)? I went to look for your young scapegrace of a Virginian.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``His (<font color='blue'><b>Virginian</b></font>) own name is a very pretty name, I'm sure,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hetty/Miss Hetty/Lambert</b></font>)</div>cries out Hetty. <div class="bookquote">``It
isn't Scapegrace! It is Henry Esmond Warrington, Esquire.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Hester, I found the parson in his (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) cassock, and Henry Esmond
Warrington, Esquire, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) bedgown, at a quarter before eleven o’clock
in the morning, when all the Sunday bells were ringing, and they were
playing over a game of piquet they had had the night before!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, numbers of good people play at cards of a Sunday. The King plays
at cards of a Sunday.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hush, my dear!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) does,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hetty/Miss Hetty/Lambert</b></font>)</div>says Hetty, <div class="bookquote">``with that painted person we saw
yesterday--that Countess what-d’you-call-her?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hetty/Miss Hetty/Lambert</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think, my dear Miss Hester, a clergyman had best take to God's books
instead of the Devil's books on that day--and so I took the liberty of
telling your parson.''  (<font color='red'><b>Hetty/Miss Hetty/Lambert</b></font>)</div>Hetty looked as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) thought it was a liberty
which Mr. Wolfe had taken. <div class="bookquote">``And I told our young friend that I thought
he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had better have been on his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) way to church than there in his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) bedgown.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You wouldn't have Harry go to church in a dressing-gown and nightcap,
Colonel Wolfe? That would be a pretty sight, indeed!''  (<font color='red'><b>Hetty/Miss Hetty/Lambert</b></font>)</div>again says Hetty,
fiercely.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I would have my little girl's tongue not wag quite so fast,''  (<font color='red'><b>papa</b></font>)</div>remarks
papa, patting the girl's flushed little cheek.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not speak when a friend is attacked, and nobody says a word in his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)
favour? No; nobody!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Here the two lips of the little mouth closed on each other: the whole
little frame shook: the child flung a parting look of defiance at Mr.
Wolfe, and went out of the room, just in time to close the door, and
burst out crying on the stair.

<p/>Mr. Wolfe looked very much discomfited. <div class="bookquote">``I am sure, Aunt Lambert, I did
not intend to hurt Hester's feelings.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, James,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) said, very kindly--the young officer used to call her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
Aunt Lambert in quite early days--and she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Wolfe</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) hand.

<p/>Mr. Lambert whistled his (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) favourite tune of <div class="bookquote">``Over the hills and far
away,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lambert</b></font>)</div>with a drum accompaniment performed by his (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) fingers on the window.
<div class="bookquote">``I say, you mustn't whistle on Sunday, papa!''  (<font color='red'><b>Grey Friars/Friars</b></font>)</div>cries the artless young
gown-boy from Grey Friars; and then suggested that it was three hours
from breakfast, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Friars</b></font>) should like to finish Theo's cheese-cake.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, you greedy child!''  (<font color='red'><b>Theo</b></font>)</div>cries Theo. But here, hearing a little
exclamatory noise outside, she (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) ran out of the room, closing the door
behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>). And we will not pursue her (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>). The noise was that sob which
broke from Hester's panting, overloaded heart; and, though we cannot
see, I am sure the little maid flung herself on her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) sister's neck, and
wept upon Theo's kind bosom.

<p/>Hetty did not walk out in the afternoon when the family took the air
on the common, but had a headache and lay on her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) bed, where her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) mother
watched her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>). Charley had discovered a comrade from Grey Friars: Mr.
Wolfe of course paired off with Miss Lowther: and Theo and her (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) father,
taking their sober walk in the Sabbath sunshine, found Madame Bernstein
basking on a bench under a tree, her (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) niece and nephew in attendance.
Harry ran up to greet his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) dear friends: he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was radiant with pleasure at
beholding them--the elder ladies were most gracious to the Colonel and
his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) wife, who had so kindly welcomed their Harry.

<p/>How noble and handsome he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) looked! Theo thought: she (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) called him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) by his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
Christian name, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) were really her (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) brother. <div class="bookquote">``Why did we not see
you sooner to-day, Harry?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I never thought you were here, Theo.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you might have seen us if you wished.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Where?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>asked Harry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) said, pointing to the church. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) held her (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) hand
up as if in reproof; but a sweet kindness beamed in her (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) honest face.
Ah, friendly young reader, wandering on the world and struggling with
temptation, may you also have one or two pure hearts to love and pray
for you!




<p/>CHAPTER XXXIII. Contains a Soliloquy by Hester


<p/>Martin Lambert's first feeling, upon learning the little secret which
his (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) younger daughter's emotion had revealed, was to be angry with the
lad who had robbed his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) child's heart away from him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) family. <div class="bookquote">``A
plague upon all scapegraces, English or Indian!''  (<font color='red'><b>the Colonel</b></font>)</div>cried the Colonel to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) wife. <div class="bookquote">``I wish this one had broke his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) nose against any doorpost but
ours.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps we are to cure him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) of being a scapegrace, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Lambert/Lambert</b></font>)</div>says Mrs.
Lambert, mildly interposing, <div class="bookquote">``and the fall at our door hath something
providential in it. You laughed at me, Mr. Lambert, when I said so
before; but if Heaven did not send the young gentleman to us, who did?
And it may be for the blessing and happiness of us all that he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) came,
too.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Lambert/Lambert</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's hard, Molly!''  (<font color='red'><b>the Colonel</b></font>)</div>groaned the Colonel. <div class="bookquote">``We cherish and fondle and rear
`em: we tend them through sickness and health: we toil and we scheme:
we hoard away money in the stocking, and patch our own old coats: if
they've a headache we can't sleep for thinking of their ailment; if
they have a wish or fancy, we work day and night to compass it, and `tis
darling daddy and dearest pappy, and whose father is like ours? and so
forth. On Tuesday morning I am king of my house and family. On Tuesday
evening Prince Whippersnapper makes his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) appearance, and my reign is
over. A whole life is forgotten and forsworn for a pair of blue eyes, a
pair of lean shanks, and a head of yellow hair.''

 (<font color='red'><b>women</b></font>)</div><p/>```Tis written that we women should leave all to follow our husband. I
think our courtship was not very long, dear Martin!'' said the matron,
laying her (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>) hand on her (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>) husband's arm.

<p/>```Tis human nature, and what can you expect of the jade?'' sighed the
Colonel.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And I think I did my duty to my husband, though I own I left my papa
for him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Lambert/Lambert</b></font>)</div>added Mrs. Lambert, softly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Excellent wench! Perdition catch my soul! but I do love thee, Molly!''
 (<font color='red'><b>the Colonel</b></font>)</div>says the good Colonel; <div class="bookquote">``but, then, mind you, your father never did me;
and if ever I am to have sons-in-law--''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Colonel</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ever, indeed! Of course my girls are to have husbands, Mr. Lambert!''
 (<font color='red'><b>the Colonel</b></font>)</div>cries mamma.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, when they come, I'll hate them, madam, as your father did me; and
quite right too, for taking his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) treasure away from him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't be irreligious and unnatural, Martin Lambert! I say you are
unnatural, sir!''  (<font color='red'><b>the matron</b></font>)</div>continues the matron.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, my dear, I have an old tooth in my left jaw, here; and `tis
natural that the tooth should come out. But when the toothdrawer pulls
it, `tis natural that I should feel pain. Do you suppose, madam, that
I don't love Hetty better than any tooth in my head?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lambert</b></font>)</div>asks Mr. Lambert.
But no woman was ever averse to the idea of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) daughter getting a
husband, however fathers revolt against the invasion of the son-in-law.
As for mothers and grandmothers, those good folks are married over again
in the marriage of their young ones; and their souls attire themselves
in the laces and muslins of twenty-forty years ago; the postillion's
white ribbons bloom again, and they flutter into the postchaise, and
drive away. What woman, however old, has not the bridal favours and
raiment stowed away, and packed in lavender, in the inmost cupboards of
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) heart?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It will be a sad thing, parting with her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Lambert/Lambert</b></font>)</div>continued Mrs. Lambert, with
a sigh.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You have settled that point already, Molly,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Colonel</b></font>)</div>laughs the Colonel. <div class="bookquote">``Had I
not best go out and order raisins and corinths for the wedding-cake?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And then I shall have to leave the house in their charge when I go to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>), you know, in Virginia. How many miles is it to Virginia, Martin? I
should think it must be thousands of miles.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A hundred and seventy-three thousand three hundred and ninety-one and
three-quarters, my dear, by the near way,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Lambert/Lambert</b></font>)</div>answers Lambert, gravely;
<div class="bookquote">``that through Prester John's country. By the other route, through
Persia--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Lambert/Lambert</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, give me the one where there is the least of the sea, and your
horrid ships, which I can't bear!''  (<font color='red'><b>the Colonel</b></font>)</div>cries the Colonel's spouse. <div class="bookquote">``I hope
Rachel Esmond and I shall be better friends. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) had a very high spirit
when we were girls at school.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Had we not best go about the baby-linen, Mrs. Martin Lambert?''  (<font color='red'><b>husband</b></font>)</div>here
interposed her (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) wondering husband. Now, Mrs. Lambert, I dare say, thought
there was no matter for wonderment at all, and had remarked some very
pretty lace caps and bibs in Mrs. Bobbinit's toy-shop. And on that
Sunday afternoon, when the discovery was made, and while little Hetty
was lying upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) pillow with feverish cheeks, closed eyes, and a
piteous face, her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) mother looked at the child with the most perfect ease
of mind, and seemed to be rather pleased than otherwise at Hetty's woe.

<p/>The girl was not only unhappy, but enraged with herself for having
published her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) secret. Perhaps she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had not known it until the sudden
emotion acquainted her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) own state of mind; and now the little
maid chose to be as much ashamed as if she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) had done a wrong, and been
discovered in it. She (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) was indignant with her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) own weakness, and broke
into transports of wrath against herself. She (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) vowed she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) never would
forgive herself for submitting to such a humiliation. So the young pard,
wounded by the hunter's dart, chafes with rage in the forest, is angry
with the surprise of the rankling steel in her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) side, and snarls and
bites at her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) sister-cubs, and the leopardess, her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) spotted mother.

<p/>Little Hetty tore and gnawed, and growled, so that I should not like to
have been her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) fraternal cub, or her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) spotted dam or sire. <div class="bookquote">``What business
has any young woman,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) cried out, <div class="bookquote">``to indulge in any such nonsense?
Mamma, I ought to be whipped, and sent to bed. I know perfectly well
that Mr. Warrington does not care a fig about me. I dare say he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) likes
French actresses and the commonest little milliner-girl in the toy-shop
better than me. And so he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) ought, and so they are better than me. Why,
what a fool I am to burst out crying like a ninny about nothing, and
because Mr. Wolfe said Harry played cards of a Sunday! I know he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) is not
clever, like papa. I believe he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) is stupid--I am certain he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) is stupid:
but he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) is not so stupid as I am. Why, of course, I can't marry him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>).
How am I to go to America, and leave you and Theo? Of course, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) likes
somebody else, at America, or at Tunbridge, or at Jericho, or somewhere.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) is a prince in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) own country, and can't think of marrying a poor
half-pay officer's daughter, with twopence to her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) fortune. Used not you
to tell me how, when I was a baby, I cried and wanted the moon? I am
a baby now, a most absurd, silly, little baby--don't talk to me, Mrs.
Lambert, I am. Only there is this to be said, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) don't know anything
about it, and I would rather cut my tongue out than tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Dire were the threats with which Hetty menaced Theo, in case her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
sister should betray her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>). As for the infantile Charley, his (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) mind being
altogether set on cheese-cakes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) had not remarked or been moved by
Miss Hester's emotion; and the parents and the kind sister of course all
promised not to reveal the little maid's secret.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I begin to think it had been best for us to stay at home,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Lambert/Lambert</b></font>)</div>sighed Mrs.
Lambert to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) husband.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>replied the other. <div class="bookquote">``Human nature will be human nature;
surely Hetty's mother told me herself that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had the beginning of a
liking for a certain young curate before she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) fell over head and ears in
love with a certain young officer of Kingsley's. And as for me, my
heart was wounded in a dozen places ere Miss Molly Benson took entire
possession of it. Our sons and daughters must follow in the way of their
parents before them, I suppose. Why, but yesterday, you were scolding me
for grumbling at Miss Het's precocious fancies. To do the child justice,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Het</b></font>) disguises her (<font color='blue'><b>Het</b></font>) feelings entirely, and I defy Mr. Warrington to know
from her (<font color='blue'><b>Het</b></font>) behaviour how she (<font color='blue'><b>Het</b></font>) is disposed towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A daughter of mine and yours, Martin,''  (<font color='red'><b>the mother</b></font>)</div>cries the mother, with great
dignity, <div class="bookquote">``is not going to fling herself at a gentleman's head!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the mother</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Neither herself nor the teacup, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Colonel</b></font>)</div>answers the Colonel. Little
Miss Het treats Mr. Warrington like a vixen. He (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) never comes to us, but
she (<font color='blue'><b>vixen</b></font>) boxes his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) ears in one fashion or t'other. I protest she (<font color='blue'><b>vixen</b></font>) is barely
civil to him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>); but, knowing what is going on in the young hypocrite's
mind, I am not going to be angry at her (<font color='blue'><b>vixen</b></font>) rudeness.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) hath no need to be rude at all, Martin; and our girl is good
enough for any gentleman in England or America. Why, if their ages suit,
shouldn't they marry after all, sir?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, if he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) wants her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), shouldn't he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) ask her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), my dear? I am sorry we
came. I am for putting the horses into the carriage, and turning their
heads towards home again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>mamma</b></font>)</div><p/>But mamma fondly said, <div class="bookquote">``Depend on it, my dear, that these matters are
wisely ordained for us. Depend upon it, Martin, it was not for nothing
that Harry Warrington was brought to our gate in that way; and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>)
and our children are thus brought together again. If that marriage has
been decreed in Heaven, a marriage it will be.''

 (<font color='red'><b>mamma</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``At what age, Molly, I wonder, do women begin and leave off
match-making? If our little chit falls in love and falls out again, she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
will not be the first of her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) sex, Mrs. Lambert. I wish we were on our
way home again, and, if I had my will, would trot off this very night.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) has promised to drink his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) tea here to-night. You would not take away
our child's pleasure, Martin?''  (<font color='red'><b>the mother</b></font>)</div>asked the mother, softly.

<p/>In his (<font color='blue'><b>hypocrite</b></font>) fashion, the father was not less good-natured. <div class="bookquote">``You know, my
dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Lambert/Lambert</b></font>)</div>says Lambert, <div class="bookquote">``that if either of `em had a fancy to our ears, we
would cut them off and serve them in a fricassee.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Lambert/Lambert</b></font>)</div><p/>Mary Lambert laughed at the idea of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) pretty little delicate ears
being so served. When her (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) husband was most tender-hearted, his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) habit
was to be most grotesque. When he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) pulled the pretty little delicate ear,
behind which the matron's fine hair was combed back, wherein twinkled
a shining line or two of silver, I dare say he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) did not hurt her (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>) much. I
dare say she (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>) was thinking of the soft, well-remembered times of her (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>) own
modest youth and sweet courtship. Hallowed remembrances of sacred times!
If the sight of youthful love is pleasant to behold, how much more
charming the aspect of the affection that has survived years, sorrows,
faded beauty perhaps, and life's doubts, differences, trouble!

<p/>In regard of her (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>) promise to disguise her (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>) feelings for Mr. Warrington in
that gentleman's presence, Miss Hester was better, or worse if you will,
than her (<font color='blue'><b>Hester</b></font>) word. Harry not only came to take tea with his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) friends, but
invited them for the next day to an entertainment at the Rooms, to be
given in their special honour.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A dance, and given for us!''  (<font color='red'><b>Theo</b></font>)</div>cries Theo. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, Harry, how delightful! I
wish we could begin this very minute!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, for a savage Virginian, I declare, Harry Warrington, thou art the
most civilised young man possible!''  (<font color='red'><b>the Colonel</b></font>)</div>says the Colonel. <div class="bookquote">``My dear, shall we
dance a minuet together?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We have done such a thing before, Martin Lambert!''  (<font color='red'><b>the soldier</b></font>)</div>says the soldier's
fond wife. Her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) husband hums a minuet tune; whips a plate from the
tea-table, and makes a preparatory bow and flourish with it as if it
were a hat, whilst madam performs her (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>) best curtsey.

<p/>Only Hetty, of the party, persists in looking glum and displeased. <div class="bookquote">``Why,
child, have you not a word of thanks to throw to Mr. Warrington?''  (<font color='red'><b>Theo</b></font>)</div>asks
Theo of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) sister.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I never did care for dancing much,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hetty/Miss Hetty/Lambert</b></font>)</div>says Hetty. <div class="bookquote">``What is the use of
standing up opposite a stupid man, and dancing down a room with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Merci du compliment!''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Warrington.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't say that you are stupid--that is--that is, I--I only meant
country dances,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hetty/Miss Hetty/Lambert</b></font>)</div>says Hetty, biting her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) lips, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) caught her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) sister's
eye. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) remembered she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) had said Harry was stupid, and Theo's droll
humorous glance was her (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) only reminder.

<p/>But with this Miss Hetty chose to be as angry as if it had been quite a
cruel rebuke. <div class="bookquote">``I hate dancing--there--I own it,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) says, with a toss
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) head.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, you used to like it well enough, child!!''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>interposes her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) mother.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That was when she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) was a child: don't you see she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) is grown up to be an
old woman?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hetty/Miss Hetty/Lambert</b></font>)</div>remarks Hetty's father. <div class="bookquote">``Or perhaps Miss Hester has got the
gout?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Fiddle!''  (<font color='red'><b>Hester/Miss Hester/Miss Hester Lambert</b></font>)</div>says Hester, snappishly, drubbing with her (<font color='blue'><b>Hester</b></font>) little feet.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What's a dance without a fiddle?''  (<font color='red'><b>papa</b></font>)</div>says imperturbed papa.

<p/>Darkness has come over Harry Warrington's face. <div class="bookquote">``I come to try my best,
and give them pleasure and a dance,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) thinks, <div class="bookquote">``and the little thing
tells me she (<font color='blue'><b>Hester</b></font>) hates dancing. We don't practise kindness, or acknowledge
hospitality so in our country. No--nor speak to our parents so,
neither.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>I am afraid, in this particular usages have changed in the
United States during the last hundred years, and that the young folks
there are considerably Hettified.

<p/>Not content with this, Miss Hester must proceed to make such fun of
all the company at the Wells, and especially of Harry's own immediate
pursuits and companions, that the honest lad was still further pained at
her (<font color='blue'><b>Hester</b></font>) behaviour; and, when he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) saw Mrs. Lambert alone, asked how or in
what he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) had again offended, that Hester was so angry with him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>)? The kind
matron felt more than ever well disposed towards the boy, after her (<font color='blue'><b>Hester</b></font>)
daughter's conduct to him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Hester</b></font>) would have liked to tell the secret
which Hester hid so fiercely. Theo, too, remonstrated with her (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) sister in
private; but Hester would not listen to the subject, and was as angry in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Hester</b></font>) bedroom, when the girls were alone, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Hester</b></font>) had been in the parlour
before her (<font color='blue'><b>Hester</b></font>) mother's company. <div class="bookquote">``Suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>parents</b></font>) hates me?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>says she (<font color='blue'><b>Hester</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I expect
he (<font color='blue'><b>parents</b></font>) will. I hate myself, I do, and scorn myself for being such an idiot.
How ought he (<font color='blue'><b>idiot</b></font>) to do otherwise than hate me? Didn't I abuse him (<font color='blue'><b>idiot</b></font>), call him (<font color='blue'><b>idiot</b></font>)
goose, all sorts of names? And know he (<font color='blue'><b>idiot</b></font>) is not clever all the time. I
know I have better wits than he (<font color='blue'><b>idiot</b></font>) has. It is only because he (<font color='blue'><b>idiot</b></font>) is tall, and
has blue eyes, and a pretty nose that I like him (<font color='blue'><b>idiot</b></font>). What an absurd fool a
girl must be to like a man merely because he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has a blue nose and hooked
eyes! So I am a fool, and I won't have you say a word to the contrary,
Theo!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Theo</b></font>)</div><p/>Now Theo thought that her (<font color='blue'><b>Hester</b></font>) little sister, far from being a fool, was
a wonder of wonders, and that if any girl was worthy of any prince in
Christendom, Hetty was that spinster. <div class="bookquote">``You are silly sometimes, Hetty,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Theo/Lady Theo</b></font>)</div>says Theo, <div class="bookquote">``that is when you speak unkindly to people who mean you well,
as you did to Mr. Warrington at tea to-night. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) proposed to us his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>)
party at the Assembly Rooms, and nothing could be more gallant of him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>),
why did you say you didn't care for music, or dancing, or tea? You know
you love them all!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Theo/Lady Theo</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I said it merely to vex myself, Theo, and annoy myself, and whip
myself, as I deserve, child. And, besides, how can you expect such an
idiot as I am to say anything but idiotic things? Do you know, it
quite pleased me to see him (<font color='blue'><b>idiot</b></font>) angry. I thought, ah! now I have hurt his (<font color='blue'><b>idiot</b></font>)
feelings! Now he (<font color='blue'><b>idiot</b></font>) will say, Hetty Lambert is an odious little set-up,
sour-tempered vixen. And that will teach him (<font color='blue'><b>idiot</b></font>), and you, and mamma, and
papa, at any rate, that I am not going to set my cap at Mr. Harry. No;
our papa is ten times as good as he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) is. I will stay by our papa, and if
he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) asked me to go to Virginia with him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) to-morrow, I wouldn't, Theo. My
sister is worth all the Virginians that ever were made since the world
began.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>And here, I suppose, follow osculations between the sisters, and
mother's knock comes to the door, who has overheard their talk through
the wainscot, and calls out, <div class="bookquote">``Children, `tis time to go to sleep.''
 (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>Theo's eyes close speedily, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) is at rest; but ob, poor little
Hetty! Think of the hours tolling one after another, and the child's
eyes wide open, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) lies tossing and wakeful with the anguish of the
new wound!

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is a judgment upon me,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) says, <div class="bookquote">``for having thought and spoke
scornfully of him (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>). Only, why should there be a judgment upon me? I was
only in fun. I knew I liked him (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) very much all the time: but I thought
Theo liked him (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) too, and I would give up anything for my darling Theo. If
she (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) had, no tortures should ever have drawn a word from me--I would have
got a rope-ladder to help her (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) to run away with Harry, that I would,
or fetched the clergyman to marry them. And then I would have retired
alone, and alone, and alone, and taken care of papa and mamma, and of
the poor in the village, and have read sermons, though I hate `em, and
would have died without telling a word--not a word--and I shall die
soon, I know I shall.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>But when the dawn rises, the little maid is
asleep, nestling by her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) sister, the stain of a tear or two upon her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>)
flushed downy cheek.

<p/>Most of us play with edged tools at some period of our lives, and cut
ourselves accordingly. At first the cut hurts and stings, and down drops
the knife, and we cry out like wounded little babies as we are. Some
very very few and unlucky folks at the game cut their heads sheer off,
or stab themselves mortally, and perish outright, and there is an end
of them. But,--heaven help us!--many people have fingered those ardentes
sagittas which Love sharpens on his (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) whetstone, and are stabbed, scarred,
pricked, perforated, tattooed all over with the wounds, who recovered,
and live to be quite lively. Wir auch have tasted das irdische Glueck;
we also have gelebt and--und so weiter. Warble your death-song, sweet
Thekla! Perish off the face of the earth, poor pulmonary victim, if so
minded! Had you survived to a later period of life, my dear, you would
have thought of a sentimental disappointment without any reference to
the undertaker. Let us trust there is no present need of a sexton for
Miss Hetty. But meanwhile, the very instant she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) wakes, there, tearing
at her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) little heart, will that Care be, which has given her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) a few hours'
respite, melted, no doubt, by her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) youth and her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) tears.




<p/>CHAPTER XXXIV. In which Mr. Warrington treats the Company with Tea and a
Ball


<p/>Generous with his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) very easily gotten money, hospitable and cordial to
all, our young Virginian, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Virginian</b></font>) capacity of man of fashion, could
not do less than treat his (<font color='blue'><b>Virginian</b></font>) country friends to an entertainment at the
Assembly Rooms, whither, according to the custom of the day, he (<font color='blue'><b>Virginian</b></font>) invited
almost all the remaining company at the Wells. Card-tables were set in
one apartment, for all those who could not spend an evening without the
pastime then common to all European society: a supper with champagne in
some profusion and bowls of negus was prepared in another chamber: the
large assembly-room was set apart for the dance, of which enjoyment
Harry Warrington's guests partook in our ancestors' homely fashion. I
cannot fancy that the amusement was especially lively. First, minuets
were called, two or three of which were performed by as many couple. The
spinsters of the highest rank in the assembly went out for the minuet,
and my Lady Maria Esmond, being an earl's daughter, and the person of
the highest rank present -LRB-with the exception of Lady Augusta Crutchley,
who was lame-RRB-, Mr. Warrington danced the first minuet with his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) cousin,
acquitting himself to the satisfaction of the whole room, and performing
much more elegantly than Mr. Wolfe, who stood up with Miss Lowther.
Having completed the dance with Lady Maria, Mr. Warrington begged Miss
Theo to do him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) the honour of walking the next minuet, and accordingly
Miss Theo, blushing and looking very happy, went through her (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) exercise to
the great delight of her (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) parents and the rage of Miss Humpleby, Sir John
Humpleby's daughter, of Liphook, who expected, at least, to have stood
up next after my Lady Maria. Then, after the minuets, came country
dances, the music being performed by a harp, fiddle, and flageolet,
perched in a little balcony, and thrumming through the evening rather
feeble and melancholy tunes. Take up an old book of music, and play a
few of those tunes now, and one wonders how people at any time could
have found the airs otherwise than melancholy. And yet they loved and
frisked and laughed and courted to that sad accompaniment. There is
scarce one of the airs that has not an amari aliquid, a tang of sadness.
Perhaps it is because they are old and defunct, and their plaintive
echoes call out to us from the limbo of the past, whither they have been
consigned for this century. Perhaps they were gay when they were alive;
and our descendants when they hear--well, never mind names--when they
hear the works of certain maestri now popular, will say: Bon Dieu, is
this the music which amused our forefathers?

<p/>Mr. Warrington had the honour of a duchess's company at his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>)
tea-drinking--Colonel Lambert's and Mr. Prior's heroine, the Duchess
of Queensberry. And though the duchess carefully turned her (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) back upon a
countess who was present, laughed loudly, glanced at the latter over her (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>)
shoulder, and pointed at her (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) with her (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) fan, yet almost all the company
pushed, and bowed, and cringed, and smiled, and backed before this
countess, scarcely taking any notice of her (<font color='blue'><b>countess</b></font>) Grace of Queensberry and her (<font color='blue'><b>countess</b></font>)
jokes, and her (<font color='blue'><b>countess</b></font>) fan, and her (<font color='blue'><b>countess</b></font>) airs. Now this countess was no other than
the Countess of Yarmouth-Walmoden, the lady whom his (<font color='blue'><b>fan</b></font>) Majesty George the
Second, of Great Britain, France, and Ireland, King, Defender of the
Faith, delighted to honour. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had met Harry Warrington in the walks
that morning, and had been mighty gracious to the young Virginian. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
had told him (<font color='blue'><b>Virginian</b></font>) they would have a game at cards that night; and purblind
old Colonel Blinkinsop, who fancied the invitation had been addressed to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>), had made the profoundest of bows. <div class="bookquote">``Pooh! pooh!''  (<font color='red'><b>the Countess</b></font>)</div>said the Countess
of England and Hanover, <div class="bookquote">``I don't mean you. I mean the young Firshinian!''
 (<font color='red'><b>the Countess</b></font>)</div>And everybody congratulated the youth on his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) good fortune. At night, all
the world, in order to show their loyalty, doubtless, thronged round
my Lady Yarmouth; my Lord Bamborough was eager to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) parti at
quadrille. My Lady Blanche Pendragon, that model of virtue; Sir Lancelot
Quintain, that pattern of knighthood and valour; Mr. Dean of Ealing,
that exemplary divine and preacher; numerous gentlemen, noblemen,
generals, colonels, matrons, and spinsters of the highest rank, were
on the watch for a smile from her (<font color='blue'><b>Blanche</b></font>), or eager to jump up and join her (<font color='blue'><b>Blanche</b></font>)
card-table. Lady Maria waited upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) with meek respect, and Madame
de Bernstein treated the Hanoverian lady with profound gravity and
courtesy.

<p/>Harry's bow had been no lower than hospitality required; but, such as it
was, Miss Hester chose to be indignant with it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hester</b></font>) scarce spoke a word
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hester</b></font>) partner during their dance together; and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) took her (<font color='blue'><b>Hester</b></font>) to the
supper-room for refreshment she (<font color='blue'><b>Hester</b></font>) was little more communicative. To
enter that room they had to pass by Madame Walmoden's card-table, who
good-naturedly called out to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hester</b></font>) host as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was passing, and asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
if his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``breddy liddle bardner liked tanzing?''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I thank your ladyship, I don't like tanzing, and I don't like cards,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hester/Miss Hester/Miss Hester Lambert</b></font>)</div>says Miss Hester, tossing up her (<font color='blue'><b>Hester</b></font>) head; and, dropping a curtsey like a
<div class="bookquote">``cheese,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hester/Miss Hester/Miss Hester Lambert</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Hester</b></font>) strutted away from the Countess's table.

<p/>Mr. Warrington was very much offended. Sarcasm from the young to the old
pained him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>): flippant behaviour towards himself hurt him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>). Courteous in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) simple way to all persons whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) met, he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) expected a like politeness
from them. Hetty perfectly well knew what offence she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) was giving; could
mark the displeasure reddening on her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) partner's honest face, with a
sidelong glance of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) eye; nevertheless she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) tried to wear her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) most
ingenuous smile; and, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) came up to the sideboard where the
refreshments were set, artlessly said:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What a horrid, vulgar old woman that is; don't you think so?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What woman?''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>asked the young man.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That German woman--my Lady Yarmouth--to whom all the men are bowing and
cringing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) ladyship has been very kind to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>says Harry, grimly. <div class="bookquote">``Won't you
have some of this custard?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you have been bowing to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>), too! You look as if your negus was not
nice,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hetty/Miss Hetty/Lambert</b></font>)</div>harmlessly continues Miss Hetty.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is not very good negus,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>says Harry, with a gulp.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And the custard is bad too! I declare `tis made with bad eggs!''  (<font color='red'><b>Hetty/Miss Hetty/Lambert</b></font>)</div>cries
Miss Lambert.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish, Hester, that the entertainment and the company had been better
to your liking,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>says poor Harry.

<p/>```Tis very unfortunate; but I dare say you could not help it,'' cries the
young woman, tossing her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) little curly head.

<p/>Mr. Warrington groaned in spirit, perhaps in body, and clenched his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>)
fists and his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) teeth. The little torturer artlessly continued, <div class="bookquote">``You seem
disturbed: shall we go to my mamma?''

 (<font color='red'><b>The torturer</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, let us go to your mamma,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>cries Mr. Warrington, with glaring eyes
and a <div class="bookquote">``Curse you, why are you always standing in the way?''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>to an unlucky
waiter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``La! Is that the way you speak in Virginia?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>asks Miss Pertness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We are rough there sometimes, madam, and can't help being disturbed,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) says slowly, and with a quiver in his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) whole frame, looking down upon
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) with fire flashing out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) eyes. Hetty saw nothing distinctly
afterwards, and until she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) came to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) mother. Never had she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) seen Harry
look so handsome or so noble.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You look pale, child!''  (<font color='red'><b>mamma</b></font>)</div>cries mamma, anxious, like all pavidae matres.

<p/>```Tis the cold--no, I mean the heat. Thank you, Mr. Warrington.'' And
she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) makes him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) a faint curtsey, as Harry bows a tremendous bow, and
walks elsewhere amongst his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) guests. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hardly knows what is happening at
first, so angry is he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>).

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) is aroused by another altercation, between his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) aunt and the Duchess
of Queensberry. When the royal favourite passed the Duchess, her (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>) Grace
gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>) Ladyship an awful stare out of eyes that were not so bright now
as they had been in the young days when they <div class="bookquote">``set the world on fire;''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ladyship</b></font>)</div>turned round with an affected laugh to her (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>) neighbour, and shot at
the jolly Hanoverian lady a ceaseless fire of giggles and sneers.
The Countess pursued her (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) game at cards, not knowing, or not choosing,
perhaps, to know how her (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) enemy was gibing at her (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>). There had been a feud
of many years' date between their Graces of Queensberry and the family
on the throne.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How you all bow down to the idol! Don't tell me! You are as bad as
the rest, my good Madame Bernstein!''  (<font color='red'><b>the Duchess</b></font>)</div>the Duchess says. <div class="bookquote">``Ah, what a true
Christian country this is! and how your dear first husband, the Bishop,
would have liked to see such a sight!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Forgive me, if I fail quite to understand your Grace.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We are both of us growing old, my good Bernstein, or, perhaps, we won't
understand when we don't choose to understand. That is the way with us
women, my good young Iroquois.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Your Grace remarked, that it was a Christian country,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bernstein/Madame de Bernstein/Madame Bernstein</b></font>)</div>said Madame de
Bernstein, <div class="bookquote">``and I failed to perceive the point of the remark.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Bernstein/Madame de Bernstein/Madame Bernstein</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed, my good creature, there is very little point in it! I meant
we were such good Christians, because we were so forgiving. Don't
you remember reading, when you were young, or your husband the Bishop
reading, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Bishop</b></font>) was in the pulpit, how when a woman amongst the Jews
was caught doing wrong, the Pharisees were for stoning her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) out of hand?
Far from stoning such a woman now, look, how fond we are of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)! Any man
in this room would go round it on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knees if yonder woman bade him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
Yes, Madame Walmoden, you may look up from your cards with your great
painted face, and frown with your great painted eyebrows at me. You know
I am talking about you; and intend to go on talking about you, too. I
say any man here would go round the room on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knees, if you bade him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think, madam, I know two or three who wouldn't!''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Warrington,
with some spirit.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Quick, let me hug them to my heart of hearts!''  (<font color='red'><b>the Duchess</b></font>)</div>cries the old Duchess.
<div class="bookquote">``Which are they? Bring `em to me, my dear Iroquois! Let us have a game
of four--of honest men and women; that is to say, if we can find a
couple more partners, Mr. Warrington!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Here are we three,''  (<font color='red'><b>Baroness/Baroness Bernstein/Bernstein</b></font>)</div>says the Baroness Bernstein, with a forced laugh;
<div class="bookquote">``let us play a dummy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Baroness/Baroness Bernstein/Bernstein</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pray, madam, where is the third?''  (<font color='red'><b>the Duchess</b></font>)</div>asks the old Duchess, looking round.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Madam!''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>cries out the other elderly lady, <div class="bookquote">``I leave your Grace to boast
of your honesty, which I have no doubt is spotless: but I will thank you
not to doubt mine before my own relatives and children!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``See how she (<font color='blue'><b>Grace</b></font>) fires up at a word! I am sure, my dear creature, you are
quite as honest as most of the company,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Duchess</b></font>)</div>says the Duchess.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Which may not be good enough for her (<font color='blue'><b>Grace</b></font>) Grace the Duchess of Queensberry
and Dover, who, to be sure, might have stayed away in such a case, but
it is the best my nephew could get, madam, and his (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) best he (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) has given
you. You look astonished, Harry, my dear--and well you may. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) is not
used to our ways, madam.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Madam, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) has found an aunt who can teach him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) our ways, and a great
deal more!''  (<font color='red'><b>the Duchess</b></font>)</div>cries the Duchess, rapping her (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>) fan.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) will teach him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) to try and make all his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) guests welcome, old or
young, rich or poor. That is the Virginian way, isn't it, Harry? She (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>)
will tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), when Catherine Hyde is angry with his (<font color='blue'><b>Hyde</b></font>) old aunt, that they
were friends as girls, and ought not to quarrel now they are old women.
And she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) will not be wrong, will she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>), Duchess?''  (<font color='red'><b>the dowager</b></font>)</div>And herewith the
one dowager made a superb curtsey to the other, and the battle just
impending between them passed away.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Egad, it was like Byng and Galissoniere!''  (<font color='red'><b>Chaplain</b></font>)</div>cried Chaplain Sampson, as
Harry talked over the night's transactions with his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) tutor next morning.
<div class="bookquote">``No power on earth, I thought, could have prevented those two from going
into action!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Seventy-fours at least--both of `em!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>laughs Harry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But the Baroness declined the battle, and sailed out of fire with
inimitable skill.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why should she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) be afraid? I have heard you say my aunt is as witty as
any woman alive, and need fear the tongue of no dowager in England.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hem! Perhaps she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) had good reasons for being peaceable!''  (<font color='red'><b>Sampson/Mr. Sampson</b></font>)</div>Sampson knew
very well what they were, and that poor Bernstein's reputation was so
hopelessly flawed and cracked, that any sarcasms levelled at Madame
Walmoden were equally applicable to her (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>cried Harry, in great amazement, <div class="bookquote">``you don't mean to say there is
anything against the character of my aunt, the Baroness de Bernstein!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div><p/>The chaplain looked at the young Virginian with such an air of utter
wonderment, that the latter saw there must be some history against his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
aunt, and some charge which Sampson did not choose to reveal. <div class="bookquote">``Good
heavens!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>Harry groaned out, <div class="bookquote">``are there two then in the family, who
are--?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Which two?''  (<font color='red'><b>the chaplain</b></font>)</div>asked the chaplain.

<p/>But here Harry stopped, blushing very red. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) remembered, and we shall
presently have to state, whence he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had got his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) information regarding the
other family culprit, and bit his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) lip, and was silent.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Bygones are always unpleasant things, Mr. Warrington,''  (<font color='red'><b>the chaplain</b></font>)</div>said the
chaplain; <div class="bookquote">``and we had best hold our peace regarding them. No man or
woman can live long in this wicked world of ours without some scandal
attaching to them, and I fear our excellent Baroness has been no more
fortunate than her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) neighbours. We cannot escape calumny, my dear young
friend! You have had sad proof enough of that in your brief stay amongst
us. But we can have clear consciences, and that is the main point!''  (<font color='red'><b>the chaplain</b></font>)</div>And
herewith the chaplain threw his (<font color='blue'><b>chaplain</b></font>) handsome eyes upward, and tried to look
as if his (<font color='blue'><b>chaplain</b></font>) conscience was as white as the ceiling.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Has there been anything very wrong, then, about my Aunt Bernstein?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>continued Harry, remembering how at home his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) mother had never spoken of
the Baroness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``O sancta simplicitas!''  (<font color='red'><b>the chaplain</b></font>)</div>the chaplain muttered to himself. <div class="bookquote">``Stories, my
dear sir, much older than your time or mine. Stories such as were told
about everybody, de me, de te; you know with what degree of truth in
your own case.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Confound the villain! I should like to hear any scoundrel say a word
against the dear old lady,''  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>cries the young gentleman. <div class="bookquote">``Why, this world,
parson, is full of lies and scandal!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you are just beginning to find it out, my dear sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>the clergyman</b></font>)</div>cries the
clergyman, with his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) most beatified air. <div class="bookquote">``Whose character has not been
attacked? My lord's, yours, mine,--every one's. We must bear as well as
we can, and pardon to the utmost of our power.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You may. It's your cloth, you know; but, by George, I won't!''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>cries Mr.
Warrington, and again goes down the fist with a thump on the table. <div class="bookquote">``Let
any fellow say a word in my hearing against that dear old creature, and
I'll pull his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) nose, as sure as my name is Harry Esmond. How do you do,
Colonel Lambert? You find us late again, sir. Me and his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) reverence kept
it up pretty late with some of the young fellows, after the ladies
went away. I hope the dear ladies are well, sir?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>and here Harry rose,
greeting his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) friend the Colonel very kindly, who had come to pay him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
a morning visit, and had entered the room followed by Mr. Gumbo -LRB-the
latter preferred walking very leisurely about all the affairs of life-RRB-,
just as Harry--suiting the action to the word--was tweaking the nose of
Calumny.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The ladies are purely. Whose nose were you pulling when I came in, Mr.
Warrington?''  (<font color='red'><b>the Colonel</b></font>)</div>says the Colonel, laughing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Isn't it a shame, sir? The parson, here, was telling me that there
are villains here who attack the character of my aunt, the Baroness of
Bernstein!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't mean to say so!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lambert</b></font>)</div>cries Mr. Lambert.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I tell Mr. Harry that everybody is calumniated!''  (<font color='red'><b>the chaplain</b></font>)</div>says the chaplain,
with a clerical intonation; but, at the same time, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) looks at Colonel
Lambert and winks, as much as to say, <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) knows nothing--keep him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) in the
dark.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Lambert/Lambert</b></font>)</div><p/>The Colonel took the hint. <div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>says he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``the jaws of slander are for
ever wagging. Witness that story about the dancing-girl, that we all
believed against you, Harry Warrington.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What, all, sir?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, not all. One didn't--Hetty didn't. You should have heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
standing up for you, Harry, t'other day, when somebody--a little
bird--brought us another story about you; about a game at cards on
Sunday morning, when you and a friend of yours might have been better
employed.''  (<font color='red'><b>the clergyman</b></font>)</div>And here there was a look of mingled humour and reproof at
the clergyman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Faith, I own it, sir!''  (<font color='red'><b>the chaplain</b></font>)</div>says the chaplain. <div class="bookquote">``It was mea culpa, mea
maxima--no, mea minima culpa, only the rehearsal of an old game at
piquet, which we had been talking over.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And did Miss Hester stand up for me?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>says Harry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Hester did. But why that wondering look?''  (<font color='red'><b>the Colonel</b></font>)</div>asks the Colonel.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Hester</b></font>) scolded me last night like--like anything,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>says downright Harry.
<div class="bookquote">``I never heard a young girl go on so. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) made fun of everybody--hit
about at young and old--so that I couldn't help telling her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), sir, that
in our country, leastways in Virginia -LRB-they say the Yankees are very
pert-RRB-, young people don't speak of their elders so. And, do you know,
sir, we had a sort of a quarrel, and I'm very glad you've told me she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
spoke kindly of me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>says Harry, shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) friend's hand, a ready
boyish emotion glowing in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) cheeks and in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You won't come to much hurt if you find no worse enemy than Hester, Mr.
Warrington,''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>said the girl's father, gravely, looking not without a
deep thrill of interest at the flushed face and moist eyes of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) young
friend. <div class="bookquote">``Is he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) fond of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hester</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>the Colonel</b></font>)</div>thought the Colonel. <div class="bookquote">``And how fond? `Tis
evident he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) knows nothing, and Miss Het has been performing some of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Het</b></font>) tricks. He (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) is a fine, honest lad, and God bless him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>Colonel</b></font>)</div>And Colonel
Lambert looked towards Harry with that manly, friendly kindness which
our lucky young Virginian was not unaccustomed to inspire, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Virginian</b></font>) was
comely to look at, prone to blush, to kindle, nay, to melt, at a kind
story. His (<font color='blue'><b>Virginian</b></font>) laughter was cheery to hear: his (<font color='blue'><b>Virginian</b></font>) eyes shone confidently: his (<font color='blue'><b>Virginian</b></font>)
voice spoke truth.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And the young lady of the minuet? She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) distinguished herself to
perfection: the whole room admired,''  (<font color='red'><b>the chaplain</b></font>)</div>asked the courtly chaplain. <div class="bookquote">``I
trust Miss--Miss--''

 (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Theodosia is perfectly well, and ready to dance at this minute
with your reverence,''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>says her (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) father. <div class="bookquote">``Or stay, Chaplain, perhaps you
only dance on Sunday?''  (<font color='red'><b>The Colonel</b></font>)</div>The Colonel then turned to Harry again. <div class="bookquote">``You
paid your court very neatly to the great lady, Mr. Flatterer. My Lady
Yarmouth has been trumpeting your praises at the Pump Room. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) says
she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) has got a leedel boy in Hannover dat is wery like you, and you are a
sharming young mans.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) ladyship were a queen, people could scarcely be more respectful
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>the chaplain</b></font>)</div>says the chaplain.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let us call her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) a vice-queen, parson,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Colonel</b></font>)</div>says the Colonel, with a twinkle
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) eye.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) Majesty pocketed forty of my guineas at quadrille,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>cries Mr.
Warrington, with a laugh.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) will play you on the same terms another day. The Countess is fond
of play, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) wins from most people,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Colonel</b></font>)</div>said the Colonel, drily. ``Why
don't you bet her (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) ladyship five thousand on a bishopric, parson? I have
heard of a clergyman who made such a bet, and who lost it, and who paid
it, and who got the bishopric.

<p/>``Ah! who will lend me the five thousand? Will you, sir? asked the
chaplain.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, sir! I won't give her (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) five thousand to be made Commander-in-Chief
or Pope of Rome,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Colonel</b></font>)</div>says the Colonel, stoutly. <div class="bookquote">``I shall fling no stones
at the woman; but I shall bow no knee to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), as I see a pack of rascals
do. No offence--I don't mean you. And I don't mean Harry Warrington,
who was quite right to be civil to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), and to lose his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) money with
good-humour. Harry, I am come to bid thee farewell, my boy. We have had
our pleasuring--my money is run out, and we must jog back to Oakhurst.
Will you ever come and see the old place again?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, sir, now! I'll ride back with you!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>cries Harry, eagerly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why--no--not now,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Colonel</b></font>)</div>says the Colonel, in a hurried manner. <div class="bookquote">``We haven't
got room--that is, we're--we're expecting some friends.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>-LSB-<div class="bookquote">``The Lord
forgive me for the lie!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) mutters.-RSB- <div class="bookquote">``But--but you'll come to us
when--when Tom's at home--yes, when Tom's at home. That will be
famous fun--and I'd have you to know, sir, that my wife and I love you
sincerely, sir--and so do the girls, however much they scold you. And if
you ever are in a scrape--and such things have happened, Mr. Chaplain!
you will please to count upon me. Mind that, sir!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Colonel</b></font>)</div><p/>And the Colonel was for taking leave of Harry then and there, on the
spot, but the young man followed him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) down the stairs, and insisted upon
saying good-bye to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) dear ladies.

<p/>Instead, however, of proceeding immediately to Mr. Lambert's lodging,
the two gentlemen took the direction of the common, where, looking
from Harry's windows, Mr. Sampson saw the pair in earnest conversation.
First, Lambert smiled and looked roguish. Then, presently, at a farther
stage of the talk, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) flung up both his (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) hands and performed other
gestures indicating surprise and agitation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The boy is telling him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>the chaplain</b></font>)</div>thought the chaplain. When Mr. Warrington came
back in an hour, he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) found his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) reverence deep in the composition of a
sermon. Harry's face was grave and melancholy; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) flung down his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hat,
buried himself in a great chair, and then came from his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) lips something
like an execration.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The young ladies are going, and our heart is affected?''  (<font color='red'><b>the chaplain</b></font>)</div>said the
chaplain, looking up from his (<font color='blue'><b>chaplain</b></font>) manuscript.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Heart!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>sneered Harry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Which of the young ladies is the conqueror, sir? I thought the
youngest's eyes followed you about at your ball.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Confound the little termagant!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>broke out Harry. <div class="bookquote">``What does she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) mean by
being so pert to me? She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) treats me as if I was a fool!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And no man is, sir, with a woman!''  (<font color='red'><b>the scribe</b></font>)</div>said the scribe of the sermon.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ain't they, Chaplain?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>And Harry growled out more naughty words
expressive of inward disquiet.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``By the way, have you heard anything of your lost property?''  (<font color='red'><b>the chaplain</b></font>)</div>asked the
chaplain, presently looking up from his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) pages.

<p/>Harry said <div class="bookquote">``No!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>with another word, which I would not print for the
world.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I begin to suspect, sir, that there was more money than you like to own
in that book. I wish I could find some.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There were notes in it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>said Harry, very gloomily, <div class="bookquote">``and--and papers
that I am very sorry to lose. What the deuce has come of it? I had it
when we dined together.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I saw you put it in your pocket,''  (<font color='red'><b>the chaplain</b></font>)</div>cried the chaplain. <div class="bookquote">``I saw you take
it out and pay at the toy-shop a bill for a gold thimble and workbox for
one of your young ladies. Of course you have asked there, sir?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course I have,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Warrington, plunged in melancholy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Gumbo put you to bed--at least, if I remember right. I was so cut
myself that I scarce remember anything. Can you trust those black
fellows, sir?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can trust him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) with my head. With my head?''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>groaned out Mr.
Warrington, bitterly., <div class="bookquote">``I can't trust myself with it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div><p/>```Oh, that a man should put an enemy into his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mouth to steal away his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
brains!'''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You may well call it an enemy, Chaplain. Hang it, I have a great mind
to make a vow never to drink another drop! A fellow says anything when
he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) is in drink.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The chaplain</b></font>)</div><p/>The chaplain laughed. <div class="bookquote">``You, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>chaplain</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``are close enough!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And the
truth was, that, for the last few days, no amount of wine would unseal
Mr. Warrington's lips, when the artless Sampson by chance touched on the
subject of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) patron's loss.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And so the little country nymphs are gone, or going, sir?''  (<font color='red'><b>the chaplain</b></font>)</div>asked the
chaplain. <div class="bookquote">``They were nice, fresh little things; but I think the mother
was the finest woman of the three. I declare, a woman at five-and-thirty
or so is at her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) prime. What do you say, sir?''

 (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Warrington looked, for a moment, askance at the clergyman. <div class="bookquote">``Confound
all women, I say!''  (<font color='red'><b>the misogynist</b></font>)</div>muttered the young misogynist. For which sentiment
every well-conditioned person will surely rebuke him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>).




<p/>CHAPTER XXXV. Entanglements


<p/>Our good Colonel had, no doubt, taken counsel with his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) good wife, and
they had determined to remove their little Hetty as speedily as possible
out of the reach of the charmer. In complaints such as that under which
the poor little maiden was supposed to be suffering, the remedy of
absence and distance often acts effectually with men; but I believe
women are not so easily cured by the alibi treatment. Some of them will
go away ever so far, and forever so long, and the obstinate disease
hangs by them, spite of distance or climate. You may whip, abuse,
torture, insult them, and still the little deluded creatures will
persist in their fidelity. Nay, if I may speak, after profound and
extensive study and observation, there are few better ways of securing
the faithfulness and admiration of the beautiful partners of our
existence than a little judicious ill-treatment, a brisk dose of
occasional violence as an alterative, and, for general and wholesome
diet, a cooling but pretty constant neglect. At sparing intervals
administer small quantities of love and kindness; but not every day, or
too often, as this medicine, much taken, loses its effect. Those dear
creatures who are the most indifferent to their husbands, are those who
are cloyed by too much surfeiting of the sugar-plums and lollipops of
Love. I have known a young being, with every wish gratified, yawn in her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)
adoring husband's face, and prefer the conversation and petits soins
of the merest booby and idiot; whilst, on the other hand, I have seen
Chloe,--at whom Strephon has flung his (<font color='blue'><b>idiot</b></font>) bootjack in the morning, or whom
he (<font color='blue'><b>idiot</b></font>) has cursed before the servants at dinner,--come creeping and fondling
to his (<font color='blue'><b>idiot</b></font>) knee at tea-time, when he (<font color='blue'><b>idiot</b></font>) is comfortable after his (<font color='blue'><b>idiot</b></font>) little nap and
his (<font color='blue'><b>idiot</b></font>) good wine; and pat his (<font color='blue'><b>idiot</b></font>) head and play him (<font color='blue'><b>idiot</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>idiot</b></font>) favourite tunes; and,
when old John, the butler, or old Mary, the maid, comes in with the
bed-candles, look round proudly, as much as to say, Now, John, look how
good my dearest Henry is! Make your game, gentlemen, then! There is the
coaxing, fondling, adoring line, when you are henpecked, and Louisa
is indifferent, and bored out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) existence. There is the manly,
selfish, effectual system, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) answers to the whistle and comes in
at <div class="bookquote">``Down Charge;''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and knows her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) master; and frisks and fawns about him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>);
and nuzzles at his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) knees; and <div class="bookquote">``licks the hand that's raised'' (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>--that's
raised to do her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) good, as -LRB-I quote from memory-RRB- Mr. Pope finely
observes. What used the late lamented O’Connell to say, over whom a
grateful country has raised such a magnificent testimonial? <div class="bookquote">``Hereditary
bondsmen,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Pope</b></font>) used to remark, <div class="bookquote">``know ye not, who would be free,
themselves must strike the blow?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Of course you must, in political as in
domestic circles. So up with your cudgels, my enslaved, injured boys!

<p/>Women will be pleased with these remarks, because they have such a taste
for humour and understand irony; and I should not be surprised if young
Grubstreet, who corresponds with three penny papers and describes the
persons and conversation of gentlemen whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Pope</b></font>) meets at his (<font color='blue'><b>Pope</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``clubs,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>will say, <div class="bookquote">``I told you so! He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) advocates the thrashing of women! He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) has
no nobility of soul! He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) has no heart!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Nor have I, my eminent young
Grubstreet! any more than you have ears. Dear ladies! I assure you I am
only joking in the above remarks,--I do not advocate the thrashing of
your sex at all,--and, as you can't understand the commonest bit of fun,
beg leave flatly to tell you, that I consider your sex a hundred times
more loving and faithful than ours.

<p/>So, what is the use of Hetty's parents taking her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) home, if the little
maid intends to be just as fond of Harry absent as of Harry present?
Why not let her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) see him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) before Ball and Dobbin are put to, and say,
<div class="bookquote">``Good-bye, Harry! I was very wilful and fractious last night, and you
were very kind: but good-bye, Harry!''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) will show no special emotion:
she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) is so ashamed of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) secret, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) will not betray it. Harry is
too much preoccupied to discover it for himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) does not know what
grief is lying behind Hetty's glances, or hidden under the artifice of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) innocent young smiles. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) has, perhaps, a care of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) own. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) will
part from her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) calmly, and fancy she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) is happy to get back to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) music
and her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) poultry and her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) flower-garden.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) did not even ride part of the way homewards by the side of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
friend's carriage. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had some other party arranged for, that afternoon,
and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) returned thence, the good Lamberts were gone from Tunbridge
Wells. There were their windows open, and the card in one of them
signifying that the apartments were once more to let. A little passing
sorrow at the blank aspect of the rooms lately enlivened by countenances
so frank and friendly, may have crossed the young gentleman's mind; but
he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) dines at the White Horse at four o’clock, and eats his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) dinner and
calls fiercely for his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) bottle. Poor little Hester will choke over her (<font color='blue'><b>Hester</b></font>)
tea about the same hour when the Lamberts arrive to sleep at the house
of their friends at Westerham. The young roses will be wan in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hester</b></font>) cheeks
in the morning, and there will be black circles round her (<font color='blue'><b>Hester</b></font>) eyes. It was
the thunder: the night was hot: she (<font color='blue'><b>Hester</b></font>) could not sleep: she (<font color='blue'><b>Hester</b></font>) will be better
when she (<font color='blue'><b>Hester</b></font>) gets home again the next day. And home they come. There is the
gate where he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) fell. There is the bed he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) lay in, the chair in which he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
used to sit--what ages seem to have passed! What a gulf between to-day
and yesterday! Who is that little child calling her (<font color='blue'><b>Hester</b></font>) chickens, or
watering her (<font color='blue'><b>Hester</b></font>) roses yonder? Are she (<font color='blue'><b>Hester</b></font>) and that girl the same Hester
Lambert? Why, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) is ever so much older than Theo now--Theo, who has
always been so composed, and so clever, and so old for her (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) age. But in
a night or two Hester has lived--oh, long, long years! So have many
besides: and poppy and mandragora will never medicine them to the sweet
sleep they tasted yesterday.

<p/>Maria Esmond saw the Lambert cavalcade drive away, and felt a grim
relief. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) looks with hot eyes at Harry when he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) comes into his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) aunt's
card-tables, flushed with Barbeau's good wine. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) laughs, rattles in
reply to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) aunt, who asks him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) which of the girls is his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) sweetheart? He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
gaily says he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) loves them both like sisters. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) has never seen a better
gentleman, nor better people, than the Lamberts. Why is Lambert not a
general? He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) has been a most distinguished officer: his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) Royal Highness
the Duke is very fond of him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). Madame Bernstein says that Harry must make
interest with Lady Yarmouth for his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) protege.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Elle ravvole de fous, cher bedid anche!''  (<font color='red'><b>Bernstein/Madame de Bernstein/Madame Bernstein</b></font>)</div>says Madame Bernstein,
mimicking the Countess's German accent. The Baroness is delighted with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) boy's success. <div class="bookquote">``You carry off the hearts of all the old women,
doesn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), Maria?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) says, with a sneer at her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) niece, who quivers
under the stab.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You were quite right, my dear, not to perceive that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) cheated
at cards, and you play like a grand seigneur,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bernstein/Madame de Bernstein/Madame Bernstein</b></font>)</div>continues Madame de
Bernstein.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Did she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) cheat?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>cries Harry, astonished. <div class="bookquote">``I am sure, ma’am, I saw no
unfair play.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No more did I, my dear, but I am sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) cheated. Bah! every woman
cheats, I and Maria included, when we can get a chance. But when you
play with the Walmoden, you don't do wrong to lose in moderation; and
many men cheat in that way. Cultivate her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) has taken a fancy to your
beaux yeux. Why should your Excellency not be Governor of Virginia,
sir? You must go and pay your respects to the Duke and his (<font color='blue'><b>Governor</b></font>) Majesty at
Kensington. The Countess of Yarmouth will be your best friend at court.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why should you not introduce me, aunt?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>asked Harry.

<p/>The old lady's rouged cheek grew a little redder. <div class="bookquote">``I am not in favour at
Kensington,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I may have been once; and there are no faces
so unwelcome to kings as those they wish to forget. All of us want to
forget something or somebody. I dare say our ingenu here would like to
wipe a sum or two off the slate. Wouldst thou not, Harry?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry turned red, too, and so did Maria, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) aunt laughed one of
those wicked laughs which are not altogether pleasant to hear. What
meant those guilty signals on the cheeks of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) nephew and niece? What
account was scored upon the memory of either, which they were desirous
to efface? I fear Madame Bernstein was right, and that most folks have
some ugly reckonings written up on their consciences, which we were glad
to be quit of.

<p/>Had Maria known one of the causes of Harry's disquiet, the middle-aged
spinster would have been more unquiet still. For some days he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had missed
a pocket-book. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had remembered it in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) possession on that day when
he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) drank so much claret at the White Horse, and Gumbo carried him (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>) to
bed. He (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>) sought for it in the morning, but none of his (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>) servants had seen
it. He (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>) had inquired for it at the White Horse, but there were no traces
of it. He (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>) could not cry the book, and could only make very cautious
inquiries respecting it. He (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>) must not have it known that the book was
lost. A pretty condition of mind Lady Maria Esmond would be in, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>)
knew that the outpourings of her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) heart were in the hands of the public!
The letters contained all sorts of disclosures: a hundred family secrets
were narrated by the artless correspondent: there were ever so much
satire and abuse of persons with whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) and Mr. Warrington came in
contact. There were expostulations about his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) attentions to other ladies.
There was scorn, scandal, jokes, appeals, protests of eternal fidelity;
the usual farrago, dear madam, which you may remember you wrote to your
Edward, when you were engaged to him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>), and before you became Mrs.
Jones. Would you like those letters to be read by any one else? Do you
recollect what you said about the Miss Browns in two or three of those
letters, and the unfavourable opinion you expressed of Mrs. Thompson's
character? Do you happen to recall the words which you used regarding
Jones himself, whom you subsequently married -LRB-for in consequence of
disputes about the settlements your engagement with Edward was broken
off-RRB-? and would you like Mr. J. to see those remarks? You know you
wouldn't. Then be pleased to withdraw that imputation which you have
already cast in your mind upon Lady Maria Esmond. No doubt her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) letters
were very foolish, as most love-letters are, but it does not follow that
there was anything wrong in them. They are foolish when written by young
folks to one another, and how much more foolish when written by an old
man to a young lass, or by an old lass to a young lad! No wonder
Lady Maria should not like her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) letters to be read. Why, the very
spelling--but that didn't matter so much in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) ladyship's days, and
people are just as foolish now, though they spell better. No, it is not
the spelling which matters so much; it is the writing at all. I for one,
and for the future, am determined never to speak or write my mind out
regarding anything or anybody. I intend to say of every woman that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
is chaste and handsome; of every man that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is handsome, clever, and
rich; of every book that it is delightfully interesting; of Snobmore's
manners that they are gentlemanlike; of Screwby's dinners that they are
luxurious; of Jawkins's conversation that it is lively and amusing; of
Xantippe, that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) has a sweet temper; of Jezebel, that her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) colour is
natural; of Bluebeard, that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) really was most indulgent to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wives,
and that very likely they died of bronchitis. What? a word against the
spotless Messalina? What an unfavourable view of human nature! What?
King Cheops was not a perfect monarch? Oh, you railer at royalty and
slanderer of all that is noble and good! When this book is concluded, I
shall change the jaundiced livery which my books have worn since I began
to lisp in numbers, have rose-coloured coats for them with cherubs on
the cover, and all the characters within shall be perfect angels.

<p/>Meanwhile we are in a society of men and women, from whose shoulders
no sort of wings have sprouted as yet, and who, without any manner of
doubt, have their little failings. There is Madame Bernstein: she (<font color='blue'><b>cherubs</b></font>) has
fallen asleep after dinner, and eating and drinking too much,--those are
her (<font color='blue'><b>cherubs</b></font>) ladyship's little failings. Mr. Harry Warrington has gone to play
a match at billiards with Count Caramboli: I suspect idleness is his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>)
failing. That is what Mr. Chaplain Sampson remarks to Lady Maria, as
they are talking together in a low tone, so as not to interrupt Aunt
Bernstein's doze in the neighbouring room.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A gentleman of Mr. Warrington's means can afford to be idle,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maria/Lady Maria/Lady Maria Esmond</b></font>)</div>says Lady
Maria. <div class="bookquote">``Why, sure you love cards and billiards yourself, my good Mr.
Sampson?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't say, madam, my practice is good, only my doctrine is sound,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Chaplain with a sigh. <div class="bookquote">``This young gentleman should have some
employment. He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) should appear at court, and enter the service of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
country, as befits a man of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) station. He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) should settle down, and
choose a woman of a suitable rank as his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) wife.''  (<font color='red'><b>Sampson/Mr. Sampson</b></font>)</div>Sampson looks in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>)
ladyship's face as he (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) speaks.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed, my cousin is wasting his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) time,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maria/Lady Maria/Lady Maria Esmond</b></font>)</div>says Lady Maria, blushing
slightly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Warrington might see his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) relatives of his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) father's family,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>suggests Mr. Chaplain.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Suffolk country boobies drinking beer and hallooing after foxes! I
don't see anything to be gained by his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) frequenting them, Mr. Sampson!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They are of an ancient family, of which the chief has been knight of
the shire these hundred years,''  (<font color='red'><b>the chaplain</b></font>)</div>says the chaplain. <div class="bookquote">``I have heard Sir
Miles hath a daughter of Mr. Harry's age--and beauty, too.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know nothing, sir, about Sir Miles Warrington, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) daughters, and
his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) beauties!''  (<font color='red'><b>Maria/Lady Maria/Lady Maria Esmond</b></font>)</div>cries Maria, in a fluster.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The Baroness stirred--no--her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) ladyship is in a sweet sleep,''  (<font color='red'><b>the chaplain</b></font>)</div>says the
chaplain, in a very soft voice. <div class="bookquote">``I fear, madam, for your ladyship's
cousin, Mr. Warrington. I fear for his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) youth; for designing persons who
may get about him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>); for extravagances, follies, intrigues even into which
he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) will be led, and into which everybody will try to tempt him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>). His (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>)
lordship, my kind patron, bade me to come and watch over him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>), and I am
here accordingly, as your ladyship knoweth. I know the follies of young
men. Perhaps I have practised them myself. I own it with a blush,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sampson/Mr. Sampson</b></font>)</div>adds
Mr. Sampson with much unction--not, however, bringing the promised blush
forward to corroborate the asserted repentance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Between ourselves, I fear Mr. Warrington is in some trouble now,
madam,''  (<font color='red'><b>the chaplain</b></font>)</div>continues the chaplain, steadily looking at Lady Maria.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What, again?''  (<font color='red'><b>shrieks the lady</b></font>)</div>shrieks the lady.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hush! Your ladyship's dear invalid!''  (<font color='red'><b>the chaplain</b></font>)</div>whispers the chaplain again
pointing towards Madame Bernstein. <div class="bookquote">``Do you think your cousin has any
partiality for any--any member of Mr. Lambert's family? for example,
Miss Lambert?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There is nothing between him (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) and Miss Lambert,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maria/Lady Maria/Lady Maria Esmond</b></font>)</div>says Lady Maria.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your ladyship is certain?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Women are said to have good eyes in such matters, my good Sampson,''
 (<font color='red'><b>lady</b></font>)</div>says my lady, with an easy air. <div class="bookquote">``I thought the little girl seemed to be
following him (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then I am at fault once more,''  (<font color='red'><b>the chaplain</b></font>)</div>the frank chaplain said. <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Warrington
said of the young lady, that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) ought to go back to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) doll, and
called her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) a pert, stuck-up little hussy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah!''  (<font color='red'><b>Maria/Lady Maria/Lady Maria Esmond</b></font>)</div>sighed Lady Maria, as if relieved by the news.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then, madam, there must be somebody else,''  (<font color='red'><b>the chaplain</b></font>)</div>said the chaplain. Has he (<font color='blue'><b>chaplain</b></font>)
confided nothing to your ladyship?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``To me, Mr. Sampson? What? Where? How?''  (<font color='red'><b>Maria/Lady Maria/Lady Maria Esmond</b></font>)</div>exclaims Maria.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Some six days ago, after we had been dining at the White Horse, and
drinking too freely, Mr. Warrington lost a pocket-book containing
letters.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Letters?''  (<font color='red'><b>Maria/Lady Maria/Lady Maria Esmond</b></font>)</div>gasps Lady Maria.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And probably more money than he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) likes to own,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sampson/Mr. Sampson</b></font>)</div>continues Mr. Sampson,
with a grave nod of the head. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) is very much disturbed about the
book. We have both made cautious inquiries about it. We have--Gracious
powers, is your ladyship ill?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maria/Lady Maria/Lady Maria Esmond</b></font>)</div><p/>Here my Lady Maria gave three remarkably shrill screams, and tumbled off
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) chair.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I will see the Prince. I have a right to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>). What's this?--Where
am I?--What's the matter?''  (<font color='red'><b>Bernstein/Madame de Bernstein/Madame Bernstein</b></font>)</div>cries Madame Bernstein, waking up from her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>)
sleep. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) had been dreaming of old days, no doubt. The old lady shook
in all her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) limbs--her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) face was very much flushed. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) stared about
wildly a moment, and then tottered forward on her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) tortoiseshell cane.
<div class="bookquote">``What--what's the matter?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) asked again. <div class="bookquote">``Have you killed her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>), sir?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Some sudden qualm must have come over her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) ladyship. Shall I cut her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)
laces, madam? or send for a doctor?''  (<font color='red'><b>the chaplain</b></font>)</div>cries the chaplain, with every look
of innocence and alarm.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What has passed between you, sir?''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>asked the old lady, fiercely.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I give you my honour, madam, I have done I don't know what. I but
mentioned that Mr. Warrington had lost a pocket-book containing letters,
and my lady swooned, as you see.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Madame</b></font>)</div><p/>Madame Bernstein dashed water on her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) niece's face. A feeble moan told
presently that the lady was coming to herself.

<p/>The Baroness looked sternly after Mr. Sampson, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) sent him (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) away on
his (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) errand for the doctor. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) aunt's grim countenance was of little
comfort to poor Maria when she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) saw it on waking up from her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) swoon.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What has happened?''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>asked the younger lady, bewildered and gasping.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``H'm! You know best what has happened, madam, I suppose. What hath
happened before in our family?''  (<font color='red'><b>Baroness/Baroness Bernstein/Bernstein</b></font>)</div>cried the old Baroness, glaring at her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>)
niece with savage eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, yes! the letters have been lost--ach lieber Himmel!''  (<font color='red'><b>Maria/Lady Maria/Lady Maria Esmond</b></font>)</div>And Maria, as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) would sometimes do, when much moved, began to speak in the language
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) mother.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes! the seal has been broken, and the letters have been lost, `tis the
old story of the Esmonds,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>cried the elder, bitterly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Seal broken, letters lost? What do you mean,--aunt?''  (<font color='red'><b>Maria/Lady Maria/Lady Maria Esmond</b></font>)</div>asked Maria,
faintly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I mean that my mother was the only honest woman that ever entered the
family!''  (<font color='red'><b>Baroness/Baroness Bernstein/Bernstein</b></font>)</div>cried the Baroness, stamping her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) foot. <div class="bookquote">``And she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was a parson's
daughter of no family in particular, or she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) would have gone wrong, too.
Good heavens! is it decreed that we are all to be...?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To be what, madam?''  (<font color='red'><b>Maria/Lady Maria/Lady Maria Esmond</b></font>)</div>cried Maria.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``To be what my Lady Queensberry said we were last night. To be what we
are! You know the word for it!''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>cried the indignant old woman. <div class="bookquote">``I say,
what has come to the whole race? Your father's mother was an honest
woman, Maria. Why did I leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>)? Why couldn't you remain so?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Madam!''  (<font color='red'><b>Maria/Lady Maria/Lady Maria Esmond</b></font>)</div>exclaims Maria, <div class="bookquote">``I declare, before Heaven, I am as--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maria/Lady Maria/Lady Maria Esmond</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Bah! Don't madam me! Don't call heaven to witness--there's nobody by!
And if you swore to your innocence till the rest of your teeth dropped
out of your mouth, my Lady Maria Esmond, I would not believe you!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maria/Lady Maria/Lady Maria Esmond</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! it was you told him (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>Maria/Lady Maria/Lady Maria Esmond</b></font>)</div>gasped Maria. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) recognised an arrow out of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) aunt's quiver.

<p/>``I saw some folly going on between you and the boy, and I told him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) that
you were as old as his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) mother. Yes, I did! Do you suppose I am going
to let Henry Esmond's boy fling himself and his (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) wealth away upon such
a battered old rock as you? The boy shan't be robbed and cheated in our
family. Not a shilling of mine shall any of you have if he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) comes to any
harm amongst you.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! you told him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>Maria/Lady Maria/Lady Maria Esmond</b></font>)</div>cried Maria, with a sudden burst of rebellion.
<div class="bookquote">``Well, then! I'd have you to know that I don't care a penny, madam,
for your paltry money! I have Mr. Harry Warrington's word--yes, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>)
letters--and I know he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) will die rather than break it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) will die if he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) keeps it!''  (<font color='red'><b>Maria/Lady Maria/Lady Maria Esmond</b></font>)</div>-LRB-Maria shrugged her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) shoulders.-RRB-

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But you don't care for that--you've no more heart--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Than my father's sister, madam!''  (<font color='red'><b>Maria/Lady Maria/Lady Maria Esmond</b></font>)</div>cries Maria again. The younger woman,
ordinarily submissive, had turned upon here persecutor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! Why did not I marry an honest man?''  (<font color='red'><b>lady</b></font>)</div>said the of lady, shaking her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
head sadly. <div class="bookquote">``Henry Esmond was noble and good, and perhaps might have
made me so. But no, no--we have all got the taint in us--all! You don't
mean to sacrifice this boy, Maria?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Madame ma tante, do you take me for a fool at my age?''  (<font color='red'><b>Maria/Lady Maria/Lady Maria Esmond</b></font>)</div>asks Maria.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Set him (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) free! I'll give you five thousand pounds--in my--in my will,
Maria. I will, on my honour!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``When you were young, and you liked Colonel Esmond, you threw him (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) aside
for an earl, and the earl for a duke?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Eh! Bon sang ne peut mentir! I have no money, I have no friends.
My father was a spendthrift, my brother is a beggar. I have Mr.
Warrington's word, and I know, madam, he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) will keep it. And that's what I
tell your ladyship!''  (<font color='red'><b>Maria/Lady Maria/Lady Maria Esmond</b></font>)</div>cries Lady Maria with a wave of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) hand. <div class="bookquote">``Suppose
my letters are published to all the world to-morrow? Apres? I know they
contain things I would as lieve not tell. Things not about me alone.
Comment! Do you suppose there are no stories but mine in the family?
It is not my letters that I am afraid of, so long as I have his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>), madam.
Yes, his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) word, and I trust them both.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will send to my merchant, and give you the money now, Maria,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>pleaded
the old lady.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I shall have my pretty Harry, and ten times five thousand pounds!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Maria/Lady Maria/Lady Maria Esmond</b></font>)</div>cries Maria.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not till his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) mother's death, madam, who is just your age!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We can afford to wait, aunt. At my age, as you say, I am not so eager
as young chits for a husband.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But to wait my sister's death, at least, is a drawback?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Offer me ten thousand pounds, Madam Tusher, and then we will see!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Maria/Lady Maria/Lady Maria Esmond</b></font>)</div>cries Maria.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have not so much money in the world, Maria,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>said the old lady.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then, madam, let me make what I can for myself!''  (<font color='red'><b>Maria/Lady Maria/Lady Maria Esmond</b></font>)</div>says Maria.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, if he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) heard you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Apres? I have his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) word. I know he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) will keep it. I can afford to wait,
madam,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) flung out of the room, just as the chaplain returned.
It was Madame Bernstein who wanted cordials now. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) was immensely moved
and shocked by the news which had been thus suddenly brought to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>).




<p/>CHAPTER XXXVI. Which seems to mean Mischief


<p/>Though she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) had clearly had the worst of the battle described in the last
chapter, the Baroness Bernstein, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>) next met her (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>) niece showed
no rancour or anger. <div class="bookquote">``Of course, my Lady Maria,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``you can't
suppose that I, as Harry Warrington's near relative, can be pleased at
the idea of his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) marrying a woman who is as old as his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) mother, and has
not a penny to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) fortune; but if he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) chooses to do so silly a thing,
the affair is none of mine; and I doubt whether I should have been
much inclined to be taken au serieux with regard to that offer of five
thousand pounds which I made in the heat of our talk. So it was already
at Castlewood that this pretty affair was arranged? Had I known how far
it had gone, my dear, I should have spared some needless opposition.
When a pitcher is broken, what railing can mend it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Madam!''  (<font color='red'><b>Maria/Lady Maria/Lady Maria Esmond</b></font>)</div>here interposed Maria.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Pardon me--I mean nothing against your ladyship's honour or character,
which, no doubt, are quite safe. Harry says so, and you say so--what
more can one ask?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You have talked to Mr. Warrington, madam?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) has owned that he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) made you a promise at Castlewood: that you
have it in his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) writing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly I have, madam!''  (<font color='red'><b>Maria/Lady Maria/Lady Maria Esmond</b></font>)</div>says Lady Maria.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah!''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>-LRB-the elder lady did not wince at this-RRB-. <div class="bookquote">``And I own, too, that at
first I put a wrong construction upon the tenor of your letters to him (<font color='blue'><b>tenor</b></font>).
They implicate other members of the family--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who have spoken most wickedly of me, and endeavoured to prejudice me
in every way in my dear Mr. Warrington's eyes. Yes, madam, I own I have
written against them, to justify myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But, of course, are pained to think that any wretch should get
possession of stories to the disadvantage of our family, and make them
public scandal. Hence your disquiet just now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Exactly so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maria/Lady Maria/Lady Maria Esmond</b></font>)</div>said Lady Maria. <div class="bookquote">``From Mr. Warrington I could have nothing
concealed henceforth, and spoke freely to him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>). But that is a very
different thing from wishing all the world to know the disputes of a
noble family.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Upon my word, Maria, I admire you, and have done you injustice.
These--these twenty years, let us say.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am very glad, madam, that you end by doing me justice at all,''  (<font color='red'><b>the niece</b></font>)</div>said
the niece.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``When I saw you last night, opening the ball with my nephew, can you
guess what I thought of, my dear?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I really have no idea what the Baroness de Bernstein thought of,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maria/Lady Maria/Lady Maria Esmond</b></font>)</div>said
Lady Maria, haughtily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I remembered that you had performed to that very tune with the
dancing-master at Kensington, my dear!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Madam, it was an infamous calumny.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``By which the poor dancing-master got a cudgelling for nothing!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is cruel and unkind, madam, to recall that calumny--and I shall
beg to decline living any longer with any one who utters it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maria/Lady Maria/Lady Maria Esmond</b></font>)</div>continued
Maria, with great spirit.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You wish to go home? I can fancy you won't like Tunbridge. It will be
very hot for you if those letters are found.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There was not a word against you in them, madam: about that I can make
your mind easy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So Harry said, and did your ladyship justice. Well, my dear, we are
tired of one another, and shall be better apart for a while.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is precisely my own opinion,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maria/Lady Maria/Lady Maria Esmond</b></font>)</div>said Lady Maria, dropping a curtsey.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Sampson can escort you to Castlewood. You and your maid can take a
postchaise.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We can take a postchaise, and Mr. Sampson can escort me,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>echoed the
younger lady. <div class="bookquote">``You see, madam, I act like a dutiful niece.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you know, my dear, I have a notion that Sampson has got the
letters?''  (<font color='red'><b>Baroness/Baroness Bernstein/Bernstein</b></font>)</div>said the Baroness, frankly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I confess that such a notion has passed through my own mind.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you want to go home in the chaise, and coax the letters from him (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>)!
Delilah! Well, they can be no good to me, and I trust you may get them.
When will you go? The sooner the better, you say? We are women of the
world, Maria. We only call names when we are in a passion. We don't want
each other's company; and we part on good terms. Shall we go to my Lady
Yarmouth's? `Tis her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) night. There is nothing like a change of scene
after one of those little nervous attacks you have had, and cards drive
away unpleasant thoughts better than any doctor.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maria/Lady Maria/Lady Maria Esmond</b></font>)</div><p/>Lady Maria agreed to go to Lady Yarmouth's cards, and was dressed and
ready first, awaiting her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) aunt in the drawing-room. Madame Bernstein, as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) came down, remarked Maria's door was left open. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) has the
letters upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>thought the old lady. And the pair went off to their
entertainment in their respective chairs, and exhibited towards each
other that charming cordiality and respect which women can show after,
and even during, the bitterest quarrels.

<p/>That night, on their return from the Countess's drum, Mrs. Brett, Madame
Bernstein's maid, presented herself to my Lady Maria's call, when that
lady rang her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) hand-bell upon retiring to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) room. Betty, Mrs. Brett was
ashamed to say, was not in a fit state to come before my lady. Betty had
been a-junketing and merry-making with Mr. Warrington's black gentleman,
with my Lord Bamborough's valet, and several more ladies and gentlemen
of that station, and the liquor--Mrs. Brett was shocked to own it--had
proved too much for Mrs. Betty. Should Mrs. Brett undress my lady? My
lady said she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) would undress without a maid, and gave Mrs. Brett leave to
withdraw. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) has the letters in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) stays,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bernstein/Madame de Bernstein/Madame Bernstein</b></font>)</div>thought Madame Bernstein.
They had bidden each other an amicable good-night on the stairs.

<p/>Mrs. Betty had a scolding the next morning, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Betty</b></font>) came to wait on
her (<font color='blue'><b>Betty</b></font>) mistress, from the closet adjoining Lady Maria's apartment, in which
Betty lay. She (<font color='blue'><b>Betty</b></font>) owned, with contrition, her (<font color='blue'><b>Betty</b></font>) partiality for rum-punch,
which Mr. Gumbo had the knack of brewing most delicate. She (<font color='blue'><b>Betty</b></font>) took her (<font color='blue'><b>Betty</b></font>)
scolding with meekness, and, having performed her (<font color='blue'><b>Betty</b></font>) usual duties about her (<font color='blue'><b>Betty</b></font>)
lady's person, retired.

<p/>Now Betty was one of the Castlewood girls who had been so fascinated by
Gumbo, and was a very good-looking, blue-eyed lass, upon whom Mr.
Case, Madame Bernstein's confidential man, had also cast the eyes
of affection. Hence, between Messrs. Gumbo and Case, there had been
jealousies and even quarrels; which had caused Gumbo, who was of a
peaceful disposition, to be rather shy of the Baroness's gentlemen, the
chief of whom vowed he (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) would break the bones, or have the life of Gumbo,
if he (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) persisted in his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) attentions to Mrs. Betty.

<p/>But on the night of the rum-punch, though Mr. Case found Gumbo and Mrs.
Betty whispering in the doorway, in the cool breeze, and Gumbo would
have turned pale with fear had he (<font color='blue'><b>Case</b></font>) been able so to do, no one could be
more gracious than Mr. Case. It was he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) who proposed the bowl of punch,
which was brewed and drunk in Mrs. Betty's room, and which Gumbo
concocted with exquisite skill. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) complimented Gumbo on his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) music.
Though a sober man ordinarily, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) insisted upon more and more drinking,
until poor Mrs. Betty was reduced to the state which occasioned her (<font color='blue'><b>Betty</b></font>)
ladyship's just censure.

<p/>As for Mr. Case himself, who lay out of the house, he (<font color='blue'><b>Case</b></font>) was so ill with
the punch, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Case</b></font>) kept his (<font color='blue'><b>Case</b></font>) bed the whole of the next day, and did
not get strength to make his (<font color='blue'><b>Case</b></font>) appearance, and wait on his (<font color='blue'><b>Case</b></font>) ladies, until
supper-time; when his (<font color='blue'><b>Case</b></font>) mistress good-naturedly rebuked him (<font color='blue'><b>Case</b></font>), saying that
it was not often he (<font color='blue'><b>Case</b></font>) sinned in that way.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, Case, I could have made oath it was you I saw on horseback this
morning galloping on the London road,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Warrington, who was
supping with his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) relatives.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Me! law bless you, sir! I was a-bed, and I thought my head would come
off with the aching. I ate a bit at six o’clock, and drunk a deal of
small beer, and I am almost my own man again now. But that Gumbo, saving
your honour's presence, I won't taste none of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) punch again.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>And the
honest major-domo went on with his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) duties among the bottles and glasses.

<p/>As they sate after their meal, Madame Bernstein was friendly enough. She (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>)
prescribed strong fortifying drinks for Maria, against the recurrence of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) fainting fits. The lady had such attacks not unfrequently. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) urged
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) to consult her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) London physician, and to send up an account of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>)
case by Harry. By Harry! asked the lady. Yes. Harry was going for two
days on an errand for his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) aunt to London. <div class="bookquote">``I do not care to tell you, my
dear, that it is on business which will do him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) good. I wish Mr. Draper
to put him (<font color='blue'><b>Draper</b></font>) into my will, and as I am going travelling upon a round
of visits when you and I part, I think, for security, I shall ask Mr.
Warrington to take my trinket-box in his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) postchaise to London with him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>),
for there have been robberies of late, and I have no fancy for being
stopped by highwaymen.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maria/Lady Maria/Lady Maria Esmond</b></font>)</div><p/>Maria looked blank at the notion of the young gentleman's departure,
but hoped that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) might have his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) escort back to Castlewood, whither her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>)
elder brother had now returned. <div class="bookquote">``Nay,''  (<font color='red'><b>aunt</b></font>)</div>says his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) aunt, <div class="bookquote">``the lad hath been
tied to our apron-strings long enough. A day in London will do him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) no
harm. He (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) can perform my errand for me and be back with you by Saturday.''

 (<font color='red'><b>aunt</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I would offer to accompany Mr. Warrington, but I preach on Friday
before her (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) ladyship,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sampson/Mr. Sampson</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Sampson. He (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) was anxious that my Lady
Yarmouth should judge of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) powers as a preacher; and Madame Bernstein
had exerted her (<font color='blue'><b>Yarmouth</b></font>) influence with the king's favourite to induce her (<font color='blue'><b>Yarmouth</b></font>) to
hear the chaplain.

<p/>Harry relished the notion of a rattling journey to London, and a day or
two of sport there. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) promised that his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) pistols were good, and that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) would hand the diamonds over in safety to the banker's strong-room.
Would he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) occupy his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) aunt's London house? No, that would be a dreary
lodging with only a housemaid and a groom in charge of it. He (<font color='blue'><b>groom</b></font>) would go
to the Star and Garter in Pall Mall, or to an inn in Covent Garden.
<div class="bookquote">``Ah! I have often talked over that journey,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>said Harry, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) countenance
saddening.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And with whom, sir?''  (<font color='red'><b>Maria/Lady Maria/Lady Maria Esmond</b></font>)</div>asked Lady Maria.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``With one who promised to make it with me,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the young man,
thinking, as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) always did, with an extreme tenderness of the lost
brother.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) has more heart, my good Maria, than some of us!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>says Harry's
aunt, witnessing his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) emotion. Uncontrollable gusts of grief would,
not unfrequently, still pass over our young man. The parting from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
brother; the scene and circumstances of George's fall last year; the
recollection of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) words, or of some excursion at home which they had
planned together; would recur to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and overcome him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I doubt, madam,''
 (<font color='red'><b>the chaplain</b></font>)</div>whispered the chaplain, demurely, to Madame Bernstein, after one of
these bursts of sorrow, <div class="bookquote">``whether some folks in England would suffer
quite so much at the death of their elder brother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Bernstein/Madame de Bernstein/Madame Bernstein</b></font>)</div><p/>But, of course, this sorrow was not to be perpetual; and we can fancy
Mr. Warrington setting out on his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) London journey eagerly enough, and
very gay and happy, if it must be owned, to be rid of his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) elderly
attachment. Yes. There was no help for it. At Castlewood, on one unlucky
evening, he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) had made an offer of his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) heart and himself to his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) mature
cousin, and she (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) had accepted the foolish lad's offer. But the marriage
now was out of the question. He (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) must consult his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) mother. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was the
mistress for life of the Virginian property. Of course she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) would refuse
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) consent to such a union. The thought of it was deferred to a late
period. Meanwhile, it hung like a weight round the young man's neck, and
caused him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) no small remorse and disquiet.

<p/>No wonder that his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) spirits rose more gaily as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) came near London, and
that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) looked with delight from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) postchaise windows upon the city
as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) advanced towards it. No highwayman stopped our traveller on
Blackheath. Yonder are the gleaming domes of Greenwich, canopied with
woods. There is the famous Thames, with its countless shipping; there
actually is the Tower of London. <div class="bookquote">``Look, Gumbo! There is the Tower!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, master,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>says Gumbo, who has never heard of the Tower; but Harry
has, and remembers how he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) has read about it in Howell's Medulla, and how
he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) brother used to play at the Tower, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) thinks with delight
now, how he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) is actually going to see the armour and the jewels and the
lions. They pass through Southwark and over that famous London Bridge,
which was all covered with houses like a street two years ago. Now there
is only a single gate left, and that is coming down. Then the chaise
rolls through the city; and, <div class="bookquote">``Look, Gumbo, that is Saint Paul's!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes,
master; Saint Paul's,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>says Gumbo, obsequiously, but little struck by
the beauties of the architecture. And so by the well-known course we
reach the Temple, and Gumbo and his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) master look up with awe at the rebel
heads on Temple Bar.

<p/>The chaise drives to Mr. Draper's chambers in Middle Temple Lane, where
Harry handed the precious box over to Mr. Draper, and a letter from
his (<font color='blue'><b>Draper</b></font>) aunt, which the gentleman read with some interest seemingly, and
carefully put away. He (<font color='blue'><b>Draper</b></font>) then consigned the trinket-box to his (<font color='blue'><b>Draper</b></font>) strong
closet, went into the adjoining room, taking his (<font color='blue'><b>Draper</b></font>) clerk with him (<font color='blue'><b>Draper</b></font>), and
then was at Mr. Warrington's service to take him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) to an hotel. An hotel
in Covent Garden was fixed upon as the best place for his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) residence.
<div class="bookquote">``I shall have to keep you for two or three days, Mr. Warrington,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lawyer</b></font>)</div>the
lawyer said. <div class="bookquote">``I don't think the papers which the Baroness wants can be
ready until then. Meanwhile, I am at your service to see the town. I
live out of it myself, and have a little box at Camberwell, where I
shall be proud to have the honour of entertaining Mr. Warrington; but a
young man, I suppose, will like his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) inn and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) liberty best, sir?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry said yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) thought the inn would be best; and the postchaise,
and a clerk of Mr. Draper's inside, was despatched to the Bedford,
whither the two gentlemen agreed to walk on foot.

<p/>Mr. Draper and Mr. Warrington sat and talked for a while. The Drapers,
father and son, had been lawyers time out of mind to the Esmond family,
and the attorney related to the young gentleman numerous stories
regarding his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) ancestors of Castlewood. Of the present Earl Mr.
Draper was no longer the agent: his (<font color='blue'><b>Draper</b></font>) father and his (<font color='blue'><b>Draper</b></font>) lordship had had
differences, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Draper</b></font>) lordship's business had been taken elsewhere: but
the Baroness was still their honoured client, and very happy indeed was
Mr. Draper to think that her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) ladyship was so well disposed towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>)
nephew.

<p/>As they were taking their hats to go out, a young clerk of the house
stopped his (<font color='blue'><b>Draper</b></font>) principal in the passage, and said: <div class="bookquote">``If you please, sir,
them papers of the Baroness was given to her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) ladyship's man, Mr. Case,
two days ago.''

 (<font color='red'><b>principal</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Just please to mind your own business, Mr. Brown,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lawyer</b></font>)</div>said the lawyer,
rather sharply. <div class="bookquote">``This way, Mr. Warrington. Our Temple stairs are rather
dark. Allow me to show you the way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry saw Mr. Draper darting a Parthian look of anger at Mr. Brown. <div class="bookquote">``So
it was Case I saw on the London Road two days ago,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Draper</b></font>) thought. <div class="bookquote">``What
business brought the old fox to London?''  (<font color='red'><b>folks</b></font>)</div>Wherewith, not choosing to be
inquisitive about other folks' affairs, he (<font color='blue'><b>Draper</b></font>) dismissed the subject from
his (<font color='blue'><b>Draper</b></font>) mind.

<p/>Whither should they go first? First, Harry was for going to see the
place where his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) grandfather and Lord Castlewood had fought a duel
fifty-six years ago, in Leicester Field. Mr. Draper knew the place well,
and all about the story. They might take Covent Garden on their way to
Leicester Field, and see that Mr. Warrington was comfortably lodged.
<div class="bookquote">``And order dinner,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Warrington. No, Mr. Draper could not
consent to that. Mr. Warrington must be so obliging as to honour him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) on
that day. In fact, he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) had made so bold as to order a collation from the
Cock. Mr. Warrington could not decline an invitation so pressing, and
walked away gaily with his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) friend, passing under that arch where
the heads were, and taking off his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) hat to them, much to the lawyer's
astonishment.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They were gentlemen who died for their king, sir. My dear brother
George and I always said we would salute `em when we saw `em,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>Mr.
Warrington said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You'll have a mob at your heels if you do, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lawyer</b></font>)</div>said the alarmed
lawyer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Confound the mob, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Harry/Mr. Harry Warrington</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Harry, loftily, but the passers-by,
thinking about their own affairs, did not take any notice of Mr.
Warrington's conduct; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) walked up the thronging Strand, gazing
with delight upon all he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) saw, remembering, I dare say, for all his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>)
life after, the sights and impressions there presented to him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>), but
maintaining a discreet reserve; for he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) did not care to let the lawyer
know how much he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) was moved, or the public perceive that he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) was a
stranger. He (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) did not hear much of his (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) companion's talk, though the
latter chattered ceaselessly on the way. Nor was Mr. Draper displeased
by the young Virginian's silent and haughty demeanour. A hundred years
ago a gentleman was a gentleman, and his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) attorney his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) very humble
servant.

<p/>The chamberlain at the Bedford showed Mr. Warrington to his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) rooms,
bowing before him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) with delightful obsequiousness, for Gumbo had already
trumpeted his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) master's greatness, and Mr. Draper's clerk announced that
the new-comer was a <div class="bookquote">``high fellar.''  (<font color='red'><b>the new-comer</b></font>)</div>Then, the rooms surveyed, the two
gentlemen went to Leicester Field, Mr. Gumbo strutting behind his (<font color='blue'><b>Gumbo</b></font>)
master: and, having looked at the scene of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gumbo</b></font>) grandsire's wound, and
poor Lord Castlewood's tragedy, they returned to the Temple to Mr.
Draper's chambers.

<p/>Who was that shabby-looking big man Mr. Warrington bowed to as they went
out after dinner for a walk in the gardens? That was Mr. Johnson, an
author, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Johnson</b></font>) had met at Tunbridge Wells. <div class="bookquote">``Take the advice of a man of
the world, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Draper/Draper</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Draper, eyeing the shabby man of letters very
superciliously; <div class="bookquote">``the less you have to do with that kind of person, the
better. The business we have into our office about them literary men is
not very pleasant, I can tell you.''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Indeed!''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Warrington. He (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>)
did not like his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) new friend the more as the latter grew more familiar.
The theatres were shut. Should they go to Sadler's Wells? or Marybone
Gardens? or Ranelagh? or how? <div class="bookquote">``Not Ranelagh,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Draper/Draper</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Draper, <div class="bookquote">``because
there's none of the nobility in town;''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Draper/Draper</b></font>)</div>but, seeing in the newspaper that
at the entertainment at Sadler's Wells, Islington, there would be the
most singular kind of diversion on eight hand-bells by Mr. Franklyn, as
well as the surprising performances of Signora Catherina, Harry wisely
determined that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) would go to Marybone Gardens, where they had a
concert of music, a choice of tea, coffee, and all sorts of wines,
and the benefit of Mr. Draper's ceaseless conversation. The lawyer's
obsequiousness only ended at Harry's bedroom door, where, with haughty
grandeur, the young gentleman bade his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) talkative host good night.

<p/>The next morning Mr. Warrington, arrayed in his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) brocade bedgown, took
his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) breakfast, read the newspaper, and enjoyed his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) ease in his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) inn. He (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>)
read in the paper news from his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) own country. And when he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) saw the words,
Williamsburg, Virginia, June 7th, his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) eyes grew dim somehow. He (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) had
just had letters by that packet of June 7th, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) mother did not
tell how--<div class="bookquote">``A great number of the principal gentry of the colony have
associated themselves under the command of the Honourable Peyton
Randolph, Esquire, to march to the relief of their distressed
fellow-subjects, and revenge the cruelties of the French and their
barbarous allies. They are in a uniform: viz., a plain blue frock,
nanquin or brown waistcoats and breeches, and plain hats. They are armed
each with a light firelock, a brace of pistols, and a cutting sword.''

 (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, why ain't we there, Gumbo?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>cried out Harry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why ain't we dar?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>shouted Gumbo.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why am I here, dangling at women's trains?''  (<font color='red'><b>the Virginian</b></font>)</div>continued the Virginian.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Think dangling at women's trains very pleasant, Master Harry!''  (<font color='red'><b>master</b></font>)</div>says the
materialistic Gumbo, who was also very little affected by some further
home news which his (<font color='blue'><b>Virginian</b></font>) master read, viz., that The Lovely Sally, Virginia
ship, had been taken in sight of port by a French privateer.

<p/>And now, reading that the finest mare in England, and a pair of very
genteel bay geldings, were to be sold at the Bull Inn, the lower end
of Hatton Garden, Harry determined to go and look at the animals, and
inquired his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) way to the place. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) then and there bought the genteel bay
geldings, and paid for them with easy generosity. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) never said what
he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) did on that day, being shy of appearing like a stranger; but it is
believed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) took a coach and went to Westminster Abbey, from which
he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) bade the coachman drive him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) to the Tower, then to Mrs. Salmon's
Waxwork, then to Hyde Park and Kensington Palace; then he (<font color='blue'><b>Hyde</b></font>) had given
orders to go to the Royal Exchange, but catching a glimpse of Covent
Garden, on his (<font color='blue'><b>Hyde</b></font>) way to the Exchange, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hyde</b></font>) bade Jehu take him (<font color='blue'><b>Hyde</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>Hyde</b></font>)
inn, and cut short his (<font color='blue'><b>Hyde</b></font>) enumeration of places to which he (<font color='blue'><b>Hyde</b></font>) had been, by
flinging the fellow a guinea.

<p/>Mr. Draper had called in his (<font color='blue'><b>Draper</b></font>) absence, and said he (<font color='blue'><b>Draper</b></font>) would come again; but
Mr. Warrington, having dined sumptuously by himself, went off nimbly to
Marybone Gardens again, in the same noble company.

<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) issued forth the next day, the bells of St. Paul's, Covent Garden,
were ringing for morning prayers, and reminded him (<font color='blue'><b>'s</b></font>) that friend Sampson
was going to preach his (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) sermon. Harry smiled. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had begun to have a
shrewd and just opinion of the value of Mr. Sampson's sermons.




<p/>CHAPTER XXXVII. In which various Matches are fought


<p/>Reading in the London Advertiser, which was served to his (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) worship with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) breakfast, an invitation to all lovers of manly British sport to
come and witness a trial of skill between the great champions Sutton and
Figg, Mr. Warrington determined upon attending these performances, and
accordingly proceeded to the Wooden House, in Marybone Fields, driving
thither the pair of horses which he (<font color='blue'><b>Wooden</b></font>) had purchased on the previous day.
The young charioteer did not know the road very well, and veered and
tacked very much more than was needful upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Wooden</b></font>) journey from Covent
Garden, losing himself in the green lanes behind Mr. Whitfield's round
Tabernacle of Tottenham Road, and the fields in the midst of which
Middlesex Hospital stood. He (<font color='blue'><b>Whitfield</b></font>) reached his (<font color='blue'><b>Whitfield</b></font>) destination at length,
however, and found no small company assembled to witness the valorous
achievements of the two champions.

<p/>A crowd of London blackguards was gathered round the doors of this
temple of British valour; together with the horses and equipages of a
few persons of fashion, who came, like Mr. Warrington, to patronise
the sport. A variety of beggars and cripples hustled round the young
gentleman, and whined to him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) for charity. Shoeblack-boys tumbled
over each other for the privilege of blacking his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) honour's boots;
nosegay-women and flying fruiterers plied Mr. Gumbo with their wares;
piemen, pads, tramps, strollers of every variety, hung round the
battle-ground. A flag was flying upon the building; and, on to the
stage in front, accompanied by a drummer and a horn-blower, a manager
repeatedly issued to announce to the crowd that the noble English sports
were just about to begin.

<p/>Mr. Warrington paid his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) money, and was accommodated with a seat in a
gallery commanding a perfect view of the platform whereon the sports
were performed; Mr. Gumbo took his (<font color='blue'><b>Gumbo</b></font>) seat in the amphitheatre below; or,
when tired, issued forth into the outer world to drink a pot of beer,
or play a game at cards with his (<font color='blue'><b>Gumbo</b></font>) brother-lacqueys, and the gentlemen's
coachmen on the boxes of the carriages waiting without. Lacqueys,
liveries, footmen--the old society was encumbered with a prodigious
quantity of these. Gentlemen or women could scarce move without one,
sometimes two or three, vassals in attendance. Every theatre had its
footman's gallery: an army of the liveried race hustled around every
chapel-door: they swarmed in anterooms: they sprawled in halls and on
landings: they guzzled, devoured, debauched, cheated, played cards,
bullied visitors for vails:--that noble old race of footmen is well-nigh
gone. A few thousand of them may still be left among us. Grand, tall,
beautiful, melancholy, we still behold them on levee days, with their
nosegays and their buckles, their plush and their powder. So have I seen
in America specimens, nay camps and villages, of Red Indians. But the
race is doomed. The fatal decree has gone forth, and Uncas with his (<font color='blue'><b>Indians</b></font>)
tomahawk and eagle's plume, and Jeames with his (<font color='blue'><b>Indians</b></font>) cocked hat and long
cane, are passing out of the world where they once walked in glory.

<p/>Before the principal combatants made their appearance, minor warriors
and exercises were exhibited. A boxing-match came off, but neither of
the men were very game or severely punished, so that Mr. Warrington
and the rest of the spectators had but little pleasure out of that
encounter. Then ensued some cudgel-playing; but the heads broken were
of so little note, and the wounds given so trifling and unsatisfactory,
that no wonder the company began to hiss, grumble, and show other signs
of discontent. <div class="bookquote">``The masters, the masters!''  (<font color='red'><b>the people</b></font>)</div>shouted the people, whereupon
those famous champions at length thought fit to appear.

<p/>The first who walked up the steps to the stage was the intrepid Sutton,
sword in hand, who saluted the company with his (<font color='blue'><b>Sutton</b></font>) warlike weapon, making
an especial bow and salute to a private box or gallery in which sate a
stout gentleman, who was seemingly a person of importance. Sutton was
speedily followed by the famous Figg, to whom the stout gentleman waved
a hand of approbation. Both men were in their shirts, their heads were
shaven clean, but bore the cracks and scars of many former glorious
battles. On his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) burly sword-arm, each intrepid champion wore an
<div class="bookquote">``armiger,''  (<font color='red'><b>each champion</b></font>)</div>or ribbon of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) colour. And now the gladiators shook
hands, and, as a contemporary poet says: <div class="bookquote">``The word it was bilboe.''
 (<font color='red'><b>a poet</b></font>)</div>-LSB-The antiquarian reader knows the pleasant poem in the sixth volume of
Dodsley's Collection, in which the above combat is described.-RSB-

<p/>At the commencement of the combat the great Figg dealt a blow so
tremendous at his (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) opponent, that had it encountered the other's honest
head, that comely noddle would have been shorn off as clean as the
carving-knife chops the carrot. But Sutton received his (<font color='blue'><b>Sutton</b></font>) adversary's
blade on his (<font color='blue'><b>Sutton</b></font>) own sword, whilst Figg's blow was delivered so mightily
that the weapon brake in his (<font color='blue'><b>Sutton</b></font>) hands, less constant than the heart of
him (<font color='blue'><b>Sutton</b></font>) who wielded it. Other sword were now delivered to the warriors. The
first blood drawn spouted from the panting side of Figg amidst a yell
of delight from Sutton's supporters; but the veteran appealing to his (<font color='blue'><b>veteran</b></font>)
audience, and especially, as it seemed, to the stout individual in the
private gallery, showed that his (<font color='blue'><b>veteran</b></font>) sword broken in the previous encounter
had caused the wound.

<p/>Whilst the parley occasioned by this incident was going on, Mr.
Warrington saw a gentleman in a riding-frock and plain scratch-wig enter
the box devoted to the stout personage, and recognised with pleasure his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>)
Tunbridge Wells friend, my Lord of March and Ruglen. Lord March, who was
by no means prodigal of politeness seemed to show singular deference to
the stout gentleman, and Harry remarked how his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) lordship received,
with a profound bow, some bank-bills which the other took out from a
pocket-book and handed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). Whilst thus engaged, Lord March spied out
our Virginian, and, his (<font color='blue'><b>Virginian</b></font>) interview with the stout personage finished, my
lord came over to Harry's gallery and warmly greeted his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) young friend.
They sat and beheld the combat waging with various success, but
with immense skill and valour on both sides. After the warriors had
sufficiently fought with swords, they fell to with the quarter-staff,
and the result of this long and delightful battle was, that victory
remained with her (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) ancient champion Figg.

<p/>Whilst the warriors were at battle, a thunderstorm had broken over the
building, and Mr. Warrington gladly enough accepted a seat in my Lord
March's chariot, leaving his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) own phaeton to be driven home by his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) groom.
Harry was in great delectation with the noble sight he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had witnessed:
be pronounced this indeed to be something like sport, and of the best
he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had seen since his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) arrival in England: and, as usual, associating any
pleasure which he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) enjoyed with the desire that the dear companion of
his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) boyhood should share the amusement in common with him (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) began by
sighing out, <div class="bookquote">``I wish...''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>then he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) stopped. <div class="bookquote">``No, I don't,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>says he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you wish and what don't you wish?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord</b></font>)</div>asks Lord March.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I was thinking, my lord, of my elder brother, and wished he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) had been
with me. We had promised to have our sport together at home, you see;
and many's the time we talked of it. But he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) wouldn't have liked this
rough sort of sport, and didn't care for fighting, though he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) was the
bravest lad alive.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) was the bravest lad alive, was he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>lord</b></font>)</div>asks my lord, lolling on his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>)
cushion, and eyeing his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) Virginian friend with some curiosity.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You should have seen him (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) in a quarrel with a very gallant officer,
our friend--an absurd affair, but it was hard to keep George off him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>). I
never saw a fellow so cool, nor more savage and determined, God help me.
Ah! I wish for the honour of the country, you know, that he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) could have
come here instead of me, and shown you a real Virginian gentleman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, sir, you'll do very well. What is this I hear of Lady Yarmouth
taking you into favour?''  (<font color='red'><b>the nobleman</b></font>)</div>said the amused nobleman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I will do as well as another. I can ride, and, I think, I can shoot
better than George; but then my brother had the head, sir, the head!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>says Harry, tapping his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) own honest skull. <div class="bookquote">``Why, I give you my word, my
lord, that he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) had read almost every book that was ever written; could
play both on the fiddle and harpsichord, could compose poetry and
sermons most elegant. What can I do? I am only good to ride and play at
cards, and drink Burgundy.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>And the penitent hung down his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``But
them I can do as well as most fellows, you see. In fact, my lord, I'll
back myself,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) resumed, to the other's great amusement.

<p/>Lord March relished the young man's naivete, as the jaded voluptuary
still to the end always can relish the juicy wholesome mutton-chop. <div class="bookquote">``By
Gad, Mr. Warrington,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>says he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``you ought to be taken to Exeter `Change,
and put in a show.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And for why?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A gentleman from Virginia who has lost his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) elder brother and absolutely
regrets him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>). The breed ain't known in this country. Upon my honour and
conscience, I believe that you would like to have him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) back again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Believe!''  (<font color='red'><b>the Virginian</b></font>)</div>cries the Virginian, growing red in the face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That is, you believe you believe you would like him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) back again. But
depend on it you wouldn't. `Tis not in human nature, sir; not as I read
it, at least. Here are some fine houses we are coming to. That at the
corner is Sir Richard Littleton's, that great one was my Lord Bingley's.
`Tis a pity they do nothing better with this great empty space of
Cavendish Square than fence it with these unsightly boards. By George!
I don't know where the town's running. There's Montagu House made into
a confounded Don Saltero's museum, with books and stuffed birds and
rhinoceroses. They have actually run a cursed cut--New Road they call
it--at the back of Bedford House Gardens, and spoilt the Duke's comfort,
though, I guess, they will console him (<font color='blue'><b>House</b></font>) in the pocket. I don't know
where the town will stop. Shall we go down Tyburn Road and the Park, or
through Swallow Street, and into the habitable quarter of the town? We
can dine at Pall Mall, or, if you like, with you; and we can spend the
evening as you like--with the Queen of Spades, or...''

 (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``With the Queen of Spades, if your lordship pleases,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>says Mr.
Warrington, blushing. So the equipage drove to his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) hotel in Covent
Garden, where the landlord came forward with his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) usual obsequiousness,
and recognising my Lord of March and Ruglen, bowed his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) wig on to my
lord's shoes in his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) humble welcomes to his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) lordship. A rich young
English peer in the reign of George the Second; a wealthy patrician
in the reign of Augustus; which would you rather have been? There is a
question for any young gentlemen's debating-clubs of the present day.

<p/>The best English dinner which could be produced, of course, was at the
service of the young Virginian and his (<font color='blue'><b>Virginian</b></font>) noble friend. After dinner came
wine in plenty, and of quality good enough even for the epicurean earl.
Over the wine there was talk of going to see the fireworks at Vauxhall,
or else of cards. Harry, who had never seen a firework beyond an
exhibition of a dozen squibs at Williamsburg on the fifth of November
-LRB-which he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) thought a sublime display-RRB-, would have liked the Vauxhall, but
yielded to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) guest's preference for piquet; and they were very soon
absorbed in that game.

<p/>Harry began by winning as usual; but, in the course of a half-hour, the
luck turned and favoured my Lord March, who was at first very surly when
Mr. Draper, Mr. Warrington's man of business, came bowing into the room,
where he (<font color='blue'><b>Draper</b></font>) accepted Harry's invitation to sit and drink. Mr. Warrington
always asked everybody to sit and drink, and partake of his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) best. Had he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>)
a crust, he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) would divide it; had he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) a haunch, he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) would share it; had
he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) a jug of water, he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) would drink about with a kindly spirit; had he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) a
bottle of Burgundy, it was gaily drunk with a thirsty friend. And don't
fancy the virtue is common. You read of it in books, my dear sir, and
fancy that you have it yourself because you give six dinners of twenty
people and pay your acquaintance all round; but the welcome, the
friendly spirit, the kindly heart? Believe me, these are rare qualities
in our selfish world. We may bring them with us from the country when we
are young, but they mostly wither after transplantation, and droop and
perish in the stifling London air.

<p/>Draper did not care for wine very much, but it delighted the lawyer to
be in the company of a great man. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) protested that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) liked nothing
better than to see piquet played by two consummate players and men of
fashion; and, taking a seat, undismayed by the sidelong scowls of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
lordship, surveyed the game between the gentlemen. Harry was not near
a match for the experienced player of the London clubs. To-night, too,
Lord March held better cards to aid his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) skill.

<p/>What their stakes were was no business of Mr. Draper's. The gentlemen
said they would play for shillings, and afterwards counted up their
gains and losses, with scarce any talking, and that in an undertone. A
bow on both sides, a perfectly grave and polite manner on the part of
each, and the game went on.

<p/>But it was destined to a second interruption, which brought an
execration from Lord March's lips. First was heard a scuffling
without--then a whispering--then an outcry as of a woman in tears,
and then, finally, a female rushed into the room, and produced that
explosion of naughty language from Lord March.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish your women would take some other time for coming, confound `em,''
 (<font color='red'><b>lord</b></font>)</div>says my lord, laying his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) cards down in a pet.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What, Mrs. Betty!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>cried Harry.

<p/>Indeed it was no other than Mrs. Betty, Lady Maria's maid; and Gumbo
stood behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Betty</b></font>), his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) fine countenance beslobbered with tears.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What has happened?''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>asks Mr. Warrington, in no little perturbation of
spirit. <div class="bookquote">``The Baroness is well?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Help! help! sir, your honour!''  (<font color='red'><b>Betty/Mrs. Betty</b></font>)</div>ejaculates Mrs. Betty, and proceeds to
fall on her (<font color='blue'><b>Betty</b></font>) knees.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Help whom?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>A howl ensues from Gumbo.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Gumbo! you scoundrel! has anything happened between Mrs. Betty and
you?''  (<font color='red'><b>master</b></font>)</div>asks the black's master.

<p/>Mr. Gumbo steps back with great dignity, laying his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) hand on his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) heart,
and saying, <div class="bookquote">``No, sir; nothing hab happened `twix' this lady and me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's my mistress, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Betty/Mrs. Betty</b></font>)</div>cries Betty. <div class="bookquote">``Help! help! here's the letter she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>)
have wrote, sir! They have gone and took her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>), sir!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it only that old Molly Esmond? She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)'s known to be over head and heels
in debt! Dry your eyes in the next room, Mrs. Betty, and let me and Mr.
Warrington go on with our game,''  (<font color='red'><b>lord</b></font>)</div>says my lord, taking up his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) cards.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Help! help her (<font color='blue'><b>Betty</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>Betty/Mrs. Betty</b></font>)</div>cries Betty again. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, Mr. Harry! you won't be
a-going on with your cards, when my lady calls out to you to come and
help her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)! Your honour used to come quick enough when my lady used to
send me to fetch you at Castlewood!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Confound you! can't you hold your tongue?''  (<font color='red'><b>lord</b></font>)</div>says my lord, with more
choice words and oaths.

<p/>But Betty would not cease weeping, and it was decreed that Lord March
was to cease winning for that night. Mr. Warrington rose from his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) seat,
and made for the bell, saying:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear lord, the game must be over for to-night. My relative writes to
me in great distress, and I am bound to go to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Curse her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)! Why couldn't she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) wait till to-morrow?''  (<font color='red'><b>lord</b></font>)</div>cries my lord,
testily.

<p/>Mr. Warrington ordered a postchaise instantly. His (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) own horses would take
him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) to Bromley.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Bet you, you don't do it within the hour! bet you, you don't do it
within five quarters of an hour! bet you four to one--or I'll take your
bet, which you please--that you're not robbed on Blackheath! Bet you,
you are not at Tunbridge Wells before midnight!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord</b></font>)</div>cries Lord March.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Done!''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Warrington. And my lord carefully notes down the terms
of the four wagers in his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) pocket-book.

<p/>Lady Maria's letter ran as follows:--


<p/><div class="bookquote">``MY DEAR COUSIN--I am fell into a trapp, which I perceive the
machinations of villians. I am a prisner. Betty will tell you all. Ah,
my Henrico! come to the resque of your MOLLY.''


 (<font color='red'><b>Maria/Lady Maria/Lady Maria Esmond</b></font>)</div><p/>In half an hour after the receipt of this missive, Mr. Warrington was
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) postchaise and galloping over Westminster Bridge on the road to
succour his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) kinswoman.




<p/>CHAPTER XXXVIII. Sampson and the Philistines


<p/>My happy chance in early life led me to become intimate with a
respectable person who was born in a certain island, which is pronounced
to be the first gem of the ocean by, no doubt, impartial judges of
maritime jewellery. The stories which that person imparted to me
regarding his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) relatives who inhabited the gem above-mentioned, were such
as used to make my young blood curdle with horror to think there should
be so much wickedness in the world. Every crime which you can think of;
the entire Ten Commandments broken in a general smash; such rogueries
and knaveries as no storyteller could invent; such murders and robberies
as Thurtell or Turpin scarce ever perpetrated;--were by my informant
accurately remembered, and freely related, respecting his (<font color='blue'><b>informant</b></font>) nearest
kindred, to any one who chose to hear him (<font color='blue'><b>informant</b></font>). It was a wonder how any of
the family still lived out of the hulks. Me brother Tim had brought
his (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) fawther's gree hairs with sorrow to the greeve; me brother Mick had
robbed the par'sh church repaytedly; me sisther Annamaroia had jilted
the Captain and run off with the Ensign, forged her (<font color='blue'><b>Ensign</b></font>) grandmother's will,
and stole the spoons, which Larry the knife-boy was hanged for.
The family of Atreus was as nothing compared to the race of
O’What-d’ye-call-’em, from which my friend sprung; but no power on earth
would, of course, induce me to name the country whence he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) came.

<p/>How great then used to be my naif astonishment to find these murderers,
rogues, parricides, habitual forgers of bills of exchange, and so forth,
every now and then writing to each other as <div class="bookquote">``my dearest brother,''  (<font color='red'><b>forgers</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``my
dearest sister,''  (<font color='red'><b>forgers</b></font>)</div>and for months at a time living on the most amicable
terms! With hands reeking with the blood of his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) murdered parents, Tim
would mix a screeching tumbler, and give Maria a glass from it. With
lips black with the perjuries he (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) had sworn in court respecting his (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>)
grandmother's abstracted testament, or the murder of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tim</b></font>) poor brother
Thady's helpless orphans, Mick would kiss his (<font color='blue'><b>Mick</b></font>) sister Julia's bonny
cheek, and they would have a jolly night, and cry as they talked about
old times, and the dear old Castle What-d’ye-call-’em, where they were
born, and the fighting Onetyoneth being quarthered there, and the Major
proposing for Cyaroloine, and the tomb of their seented mother -LRB-who had
chayted them out of the propertee-RRB-. Heaven bless her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) soul! They used to
weep and kiss so profusely at meeting and parting, that it was touching
to behold them. At the sight of their embraces one forgot those painful
little stories, and those repeated previous assurances that, did they
tell all, they could hang each other all round.

<p/>What can there be finer than forgiveness? What more rational than, after
calling a man by every bad name under the sun, to apologise, regret
hasty expressions, and so forth, withdraw the decanter -LRB-say-RRB- which you
have flung at your enemy's head, and be friends as before? Some folks
possess this admirable, this angellike gift of forgiveness. It was
beautiful, for instance, to see our two ladies at Tunbridge Wells
forgiving one another, smiling, joking, fondling almost in spite of
the hard words of yesterday--yes, and forgetting bygones, though they
couldn't help remembering them perfectly well. I wonder, can you and I
do as much? Let us strive, my friend, to acquire this pacable, Christian
spirit. My belief is that you may learn to forgive bad language employed
to you; but, then, you must have a deal of practice, and be accustomed
to hear and use it. You embrace after a quarrel and mutual bad language.
Heaven bless us! Bad words are nothing when one is accustomed to them,
and scarce need ruffle the temper on either side.

<p/>So the aunt and niece played cards very amicably together, and drank to
each other's health, and each took a wing of the chicken, and pulled
a bone of the merry-thought, and -LRB-in conversation-RRB- scratched their
neighbours', not each other's, eyes out. Thus we have read how the
Peninsular warriors, when the bugles sang truce, fraternised and
exchanged tobacco-pouches and wine, ready to seize their firelocks and
knock each other's heads off when the truce was over; and thus our old
soldiers, skilful in war, but knowing the charms of a quiet life, laid
their weapons down for the nonce, and hob-and-nobbed gaily together. Of
course, whilst drinking with Jack Frenchman, you have your piece handy
to blow his (<font color='blue'><b>Frenchman</b></font>) brains out if he (<font color='blue'><b>Frenchman</b></font>) makes a hostile move: but, meanwhile, it is
A votre sante, mon camarade! Here's to you, mounseer! and everything is
as pleasant as possible. Regarding Aunt Bernstein's threatened gout? The
twinges had gone off. Maria was so glad! Maria's fainting fits? She (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) had
no return of them. A slight recurrence last night. The Baroness was so
sorry! Her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) niece must see the best doctor, take everything to fortify
her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>), continue to take the steel, even after she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) left Tunbridge. How kind
of Aunt Bernstein to offer to send some of the bottled waters after her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>)!
Suppose Madame Bernstein says in confidence to her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) own woman, <div class="bookquote">``Fainting
fits!--pooh!--epilepsy! inherited from that horrible scrofulous German
mother!''  (<font color='red'><b>woman</b></font>)</div>What means have we of knowing the private conversation of the
old lady and her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) attendant? Suppose Lady Maria orders Mrs. Betty,
her (<font color='blue'><b>Betty</b></font>) ladyship's maid, to taste every glass of medicinal water, first
declaring that her (<font color='blue'><b>Betty</b></font>) aunt is capable of poisoning her (<font color='blue'><b>Betty</b></font>)? Very likely such
conversations take place. These are but precautions--these are the
firelocks which our old soldiers have at their sides, loaded and cocked,
but at present lying quiet on the grass.

<p/>Having Harry's bond in her (<font color='blue'><b>Betty</b></font>) pocket, the veteran Maria did not choose to
press for payment. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) knew the world too well for that. He (<font color='blue'><b>veteran</b></font>) was bound
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>), but she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) gave him (<font color='blue'><b>veteran</b></font>) plenty of day-rule, and leave of absence on
parole. It was not her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) object needlessly to chafe and anger her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) young
slave. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) knew the difference of ages, and that Harry must have his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
pleasures and diversions. <div class="bookquote">``Take your ease and amusement, cousin,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maria/Lady Maria/Lady Maria Esmond</b></font>)</div>says
Lady Maria. <div class="bookquote">``Frisk about, pretty little mousekin,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>says grey Grimalkin,
purring in the corner, and keeping watch with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) green eyes. About all
that Harry was to see and do on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) first visit to London, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) female
relatives had of course talked and joked. Both of the ladies knew
perfectly what were a young gentleman's ordinary amusements in those
days, and spoke of them with the frankness which characterised those
easy times.

<p/>Our wily Calypso consoled herself, then, perfectly, in the absence of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) young wanderer, and took any diversion which came to hand. Mr. Jack
Morris, the gentleman whom we have mentioned as rejoicing in the company
of Lord March and Mr. Warrington, was one of these diversions. To live
with titled personages was the delight of Jack Morris's life; and to
lose money at cards to an earl's daughter was almost a pleasure to him (<font color='blue'><b>earl</b></font>).
Now, the Lady Maria Esmond was an earl's daughter who was very glad to
win money. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) obtained permission to take Mr. Morris to the Countess
of Yarmouth's assembly, and played cards with him (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>)--and so everybody was
pleased.

<p/>Thus the first eight-and-forty hours after Mr. Warrington's departure
passed pretty cheerily at Tunbridge Wells, and Friday arrived, when the
sermon was to be delivered which we have seen Mr. Sampson preparing. The
company at the Wells were ready enough to listen to it. Sampson had a
reputation for being a most amusing and eloquent preacher; and if there
were no breakfast, conjurer, dancing bears, concert going on, the good
Wells folk would put up with a sermon. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wells</b></font>) knew Lady Yarmouth was coming,
and what a power she (<font color='blue'><b>Yarmouth</b></font>) had in the giving of livings and the dispensing of
bishoprics, the Defender of the Faith of that day having a remarkable
confidence in her (<font color='blue'><b>Yarmouth</b></font>) ladyship's opinion upon these matters;--and so we
may be sure that Mr. Sampson prepared his (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) very best discourse for her (<font color='blue'><b>Yarmouth</b></font>)
hearing. When the Great Man is at home at the Castle, and walks over to
the little country church, in the park, bringing the Duke, the Marquis,
and a couple of Cabinet Ministers with him (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>), has it ever been your lot
to sit among the congregation, and watch Mr. Trotter the curate and his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>)
sermon? He (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) looks anxiously at the Great Pew; he (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) falters as he (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) gives out
his (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) text, and thinks, <div class="bookquote">``Ah! perhaps his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) lordship may give me a living!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Trotter and the girls look anxiously at the Great Pew too,
and watch the effects of papa's discourse--the well-known favourite
discourse--upon the big-wigs assembled. Papa's first nervousness is
over: his (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>) noble voice clears, warms to his (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>) sermon: he (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>) kindles: he (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>) takes
his (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>) pocket-handkerchief out: he (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>) is coming to that exquisite passage
which has made them all cry at the parsonage: he (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>) has begun it! Ah! What
is that humming noise, which fills the edifice, and causes hob-nailed
Melibaeus to grin at smock-frocked Tityrus? It is the Right Honourable
Lord Naseby snoring in the pew by the fire! And poor Trotter's visionary
mitre disappears with the music.

<p/>Sampson was the domestic chaplain of Madame Bernstein's nephew. The two
ladies of the Esmond family patronised the preacher. On the day of the
sermon, the Baroness had a little breakfast in his (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) honour, at which
Sampson made his (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) appearance, rosy and handsome, with a fresh-flowered
wig, and a smart, rustling, new cassock, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) had on credit
from some church-admiring mercer at the Wells. By the side of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wells</b></font>)
patronesses, their ladyships' lacqueys walking behind them with their
great gilt prayer-books, Mr. Sampson marched from breakfast to church.
Every one remarked how well the Baroness Bernstein looked; she (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>) laughed,
and was particularly friendly with her (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>) niece; she (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>) had a bow and a
stately smile for all, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>) moved on, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>) tortoiseshell cane. At
the door there was a dazzling conflux of rank and fashion--all the
fine company of the Wells trooping in; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>) ladyship of Yarmouth,
conspicuous with vermilion cheeks, and a robe of flame-coloured taffeta.
There were shabby people present, besides the fine company, though these
latter were by far the most numerous. What an odd-looking pair, for
instance, were those in ragged coats, one of them with his (<font color='blue'><b>Wells</b></font>) carroty hair
appearing under his (<font color='blue'><b>Wells</b></font>) scratch-wig, and who entered the church just as
the organ stopped! Nay, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wells</b></font>) could not have been a Protestant, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Wells</b></font>)
mechanically crossed himself as he (<font color='blue'><b>Wells</b></font>) entered the place, saying to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Wells</b></font>) comrade, <div class="bookquote">``Bedad, Tim, I forgawt!''  (<font color='red'><b>comrade Bedad</b></font>)</div>by which I conclude that
the individual came from an island which has been mentioned at the
commencement of this chapter. Wherever they go a rich fragrance of
whisky spreads itself. A man may be a heretic, but possess genius: these
Catholic gentlemen have come to pay homage to Mr. Sampson.

<p/>Nay, there are not only members of the old religion present, but
disciples of a creed still older. Who are those two individuals with
hooked noses and sallow countenances, who worked into the church in
spite of some little opposition on the part of the beadle? Seeing the
greasy appearance of these Hebrew strangers, Mr. Beadle was for
denying them admission. But one whispered into his (<font color='blue'><b>Beadle</b></font>) ear, <div class="bookquote">``We wants to
be conwerted, gov’nor!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Beadle</b></font>)</div>another slips money into his (<font color='blue'><b>Beadle</b></font>) hand,--Mr. Beadle
lifts up the mace with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Beadle</b></font>) was barring the doorway, and the Hebrew
gentlemen enter. There goes the organ! the doors have closed. Shall we
go in, and listen to Mr. Sampson's sermon, or lie on the grass without?

<p/>Preceded by that beadle in gold lace, Sampson walked up to the pulpit,
as rosy and jolly a man as you could wish to see. Presently, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>)
surged up out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) plump pulpit cushion, why did his (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) Reverence turn as
pale as death? He (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) looked to the western church-door--there, on each
side of it, were those horrible Hebrew caryatides. He (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) then looked to the
vestry-door, which was hard by the rector's pew, in which Sampson
had been sitting during the service, alongside of their ladyships his (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>)
patronesses. Suddenly a couple of perfumed Hibernian gentlemen slipped
out of an adjacent seat, and placed themselves on a bench close by that
vestry-door and rector's pew, and so sate till the conclusion of the
sermon, with eyes meekly cast down to the ground. How can we describe
that sermon, if the preacher himself never knew how it came to an end?

<p/>Nevertheless, it was considered an excellent sermon. When it was over,
the fine ladies buzzed into one another's ears over their pews, and
uttered their praise and comments. Madame Walmoden, who was in the next
pew to our friends, said it was bewdiful, and made her (<font color='blue'><b>rector</b></font>) dremble all over.
Madame Bernstein said it was excellent. Lady Maria was pleased to think
that the family chaplain should so distinguish himself. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) looked up
at him (<font color='blue'><b>chaplain</b></font>), and strove to catch his (<font color='blue'><b>chaplain</b></font>) reverence's eye, as he (<font color='blue'><b>chaplain</b></font>) still sate in his (<font color='blue'><b>chaplain</b></font>)
pulpit; she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) greeted him (<font color='blue'><b>chaplain</b></font>) with a little wave of the hand and flutter of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) handkerchief. He (<font color='blue'><b>chaplain</b></font>) scarcely seemed to note the compliment; his (<font color='blue'><b>chaplain</b></font>) face
was pale, his (<font color='blue'><b>chaplain</b></font>) eyes were looking yonder, towards the font, where those
Hebrews still remained. The stream of people passed by them--in a rush,
when they were lost to sight,--in a throng--in a march of twos and
threes--in a dribble of one at a time. Everybody was gone. The two
Hebrews were still there by the door.

<p/>The Baroness de Bernstein and her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) niece still lingered in the rector's
pew, where the old lady was deep in conversation with that gentleman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who are those horrible men at the door? and what a smell of spirits
there is!''  (<font color='red'><b>Maria/Lady Maria/Lady Maria Esmond</b></font>)</div>cries Lady Maria, to Mrs. Brett, her (<font color='blue'><b>Brett</b></font>) aunt's woman, who had
attended the two ladies.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Farewell, doctor; you have a darling little boy: is he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) to be a
clergyman, too?''  (<font color='red'><b>Bernstein/Madame de Bernstein/Madame Bernstein</b></font>)</div>asks Madame de Bernstein. <div class="bookquote">``Are you ready, my dear?''  (<font color='red'><b>Bernstein/Madame de Bernstein/Madame Bernstein</b></font>)</div>And
the pew is thrown open, and Madame Bernstein, whose father was only
a viscount, insists that her (<font color='blue'><b>Brett</b></font>) niece, Lady Maria, who was an earl's
daughter, should go first out of the pew.

<p/>As she (<font color='blue'><b>Brett</b></font>) steps forward, those individuals whom her (<font color='blue'><b>Brett</b></font>) ladyship designated as
two horrible men, advance. One of them pulls a long strip of paper out
of his (<font color='blue'><b>earl</b></font>) pocket, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Brett</b></font>) ladyship starts and turns pale. She (<font color='blue'><b>Brett</b></font>) makes for the
vestry, in a vague hope that she (<font color='blue'><b>Brett</b></font>) can clear the door and close it behind
her (<font color='blue'><b>Brett</b></font>). The two whiskified gentlemen are up with her (<font color='blue'><b>Brett</b></font>), however; one of them
actually lays his (<font color='blue'><b>earl</b></font>) hand on her (<font color='blue'><b>Brett</b></font>) shoulder, and says:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``At the shuit of Misthress Pincott, of Kinsington, mercer, I have the
honour of arresting your leedyship. Me neem is Costigan, madam, a poor
gentleman of Oireland, binding to circumstances and forced to follow a
disagrayable profession. Will your leedyship walk, or shall me man go
fetch a cheer?''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>For reply Lady Maria Esmond gives three shrieks, and falls swooning to
the ground. <div class="bookquote">``Keep the door, Mick!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Costigan/Costigan</b></font>)</div>shouts Mr. Costigan. <div class="bookquote">``Best let in no
one else, madam,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Costigan</b></font>) says, very politely, to Madame de Bernstein. <div class="bookquote">``Her (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>)
ladyship has fallen in a feenting fit, and will recover here, at her (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>)
aise.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Unlace her (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>), Brett!''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>cries the old lady, whose eyes twinkle oddly; and
as soon as that operation is performed, Madame Bernstein seizes a little
bag suspended by a hair chain, which Lady Maria wears round her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) neck,
and snips the necklace in twain. <div class="bookquote">``Dash some cold water over her (<font color='blue'><b>Brett</b></font>) face, it
always recovers her (<font color='blue'><b>Brett</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>the Baroness</b></font>)</div>says the Baroness. <div class="bookquote">``You stay with her (<font color='blue'><b>Brett</b></font>), Brett. How
much is your suit gentlemen?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Costigan/Costigan</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Costigan says, <div class="bookquote">``The deem we have against her (<font color='blue'><b>Brett</b></font>) leedyship for one
hundred and thirty-two pounds, in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Brett</b></font>) is indebted to Misthress
Eliza Pincott''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Costigan/Costigan</b></font>)</div><p/>Meanwhile, where is the Reverend Mr. Sampson? Like the fabled opossum we
have read of, who, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) spied the unerring gunner from his (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) gum-tree,
said: <div class="bookquote">``It's no use Major, I will come down,''  (<font color='red'><b>the gunner</b></font>)</div>so Sampson gave himself up
to his (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) pursuers. <div class="bookquote">``At whose suit, Simons?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) sadly asked. Sampson knew
Simons: they had met many a time before.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Buckleby Cordwainer,''  (<font color='red'><b>Simons/Mr. Simons</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Simons.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Forty-eight pound and charges, I know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sampson/Mr. Sampson</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Sampson, with a sigh.
<div class="bookquote">``I haven't got the money. What officer is there here?''  (<font color='red'><b>Simons/Mr. Simons</b></font>)</div>Mr. Simons's
companion, Mr. Lyons, here stepped forward, and said his (<font color='blue'><b>Lyons</b></font>) house was most
convenient, and often used by gentlemen, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Lyons</b></font>) should be most happy and
proud to accommodate his (<font color='blue'><b>Lyons</b></font>) reverence.

<p/>Two chairs happened to be in waiting outside the chapel. In those two
chairs my Lady Maria Esmond and Mr. Sampson placed themselves, and went
to Mr. Lyons's residence, escorted by the gentlemen to whom we have just
been introduced.

<p/>Very soon after the capture the Baroness Bernstein sent Mr. Case, her (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>)
confidential servant, with a note to her (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>) niece, full of expressions of
the most ardent affection: but regretting that her (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>) heavy losses at cards
rendered the payment of such a sum as that in which Lady Maria stood
indebted quite impossible. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) had written off to Mrs. Pincott, by that
very post, however, to entreat her (<font color='blue'><b>Pincott</b></font>) to grant time, and as soon as ever
she (<font color='blue'><b>Pincott</b></font>) had an answer, would not fail to acquaint her (<font color='blue'><b>Pincott</b></font>) dear unhappy niece.

<p/>Mrs. Betty came over to console her (<font color='blue'><b>Betty</b></font>) mistress: and the two poor women
cast about for money enough to provide a horse and chaise for Mrs.
Betty, who had very nearly come to misfortune, too. Both my Lady Maria
and her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) maid had been unlucky at cards, and could not muster more than
eighteen shillings between them: so it was agreed that Betty should sell
a gold chain belonging to her (<font color='blue'><b>Betty</b></font>) lady, and with the money travel to London.
Now, Betty took the chain to the very toy-shop man who had sold it to
Mr. Warrington, who had given it to his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) cousin; and the toy-shop man,
supposing that she (<font color='blue'><b>Betty</b></font>) had stolen the chain, was for bringing in a constable
to Betty. Hence, she (<font color='blue'><b>Betty</b></font>) had to make explanations, and to say how her (<font color='blue'><b>Betty</b></font>)
mistress was in durance; and, ere the night closed, all Tunbridge Wells
knew that my Lady Maria Esmond was in the hands of bailiffs. Meanwhile,
however, the money was found, and Mrs. Betty whisked up to London in
search of the champion in whom the poor prisoner confided.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't say anything about that paper being gone! Oh, the wretch, the
wretch! She (<font color='blue'><b>Brett</b></font>) shall pay it me!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I presume that Lady Maria meant her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) aunt
by the word <div class="bookquote">``wretch.''  (<font color='red'><b>aunt</b></font>)</div>Mr. Sampson read a sermon to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) ladyship, and
they passed the evening over revenge and backgammon; with well-grounded
hopes that Harry Warrington would rush to their rescue as soon as ever
he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) heard of their mishap.

<p/>Though, ere the evening was over, every soul at the Wells knew what had
happened to Lady Maria, and a great deal more; though they knew she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) was
taken in execution, the house where she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) lay, the amount--nay, ten times
the amount--for which she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) was captured, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) was obliged to pawn
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) trinkets to get a little money to keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) in jail; though everybody
said that old fiend of a Bernstein was at the bottom of the business,
of course they were all civil and bland in society; and, at my Lady
Trumpington's cards that night, where Madame Bernstein appeared, and
as long as she (<font color='blue'><b>Trumpington</b></font>) was within hearing, not a word was said regarding the
morning's transactions. Lady Yarmouth asked the Baroness news of her (<font color='blue'><b>Yarmouth</b></font>)
breddy nephew, and heard Mr. Warrington was in London. My Lady Maria
was not coming to Lady Trumpington's that evening? My Lady Maria was
indisposed, had fainted at church that morning, and was obliged to keep
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) room. The cards were dealt, the fiddles sang, the wine went round,
the gentlefolks talked, laughed, yawned, chattered, the footmen waylaid
the supper, the chairmen drank and swore, the stars climbed the sky,
just as though no Lady Maria was imprisoned, and no poor Sampson
arrested. `Tis certain, dearly beloved brethren, that the little griefs,
stings, annoyances, which you and I feel acutely in our own persons,
don't prevent our neighbours from sleeping; and that when we slip out of
the world the world does not miss us. Is this humiliating to our vanity?
So much the better. But, on the other hand, is it not a comfortable and
consoling truth? And mayn't we be thankful for our humble condition? If
we were not selfish--passez-moi le mot, s.v.p.--and if we had to care
for other people's griefs as much as our own, how intolerable human life
would be! If my neighbour's tight boot pinched my corn; if the calumny
uttered against Jones set Brown into fury; if Mrs. A's death plunged
Messrs. B, C, D, E, F, into distraction, would there be any bearing of
the world's burthen? Do not let us be in the least angry or surprised if
all the company played on, and were happy, although Lady Maria had come
to grief. Countess, the deal is with you! Are you going to Stubblefield
to shoot as usual, Sir John? Captain, we shall have you running off to
the Bath after the widow! So the clatter goes on; the lights burns; the
beaux and the ladies flirt, laugh, ogle; the prisoner rages in his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) cell;
the sick man tosses on his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) bed.

<p/>Perhaps Madame de Bernstein stayed at the assembly until the very last,
not willing to allow the company the chance of speaking of her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) as soon
as her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) back should be turned. Ah, what a comfort it is, I say again,
that we have backs, and that our ears don't grow on them! He (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>) that has
ears to hear, let him (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>) stuff them with cotton. Madame Bernstein might
have heard folks say it was heartless of her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) to come abroad, and play
at cards, and make merry when her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) niece was in trouble. As if she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) could
help Maria by staying at home, indeed! At her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) age, it is dangerous to
disturb an old lady's tranquillity. <div class="bookquote">``Don't tell me!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Yarmouth</b></font>)</div>says Lady Yarmouth.
<div class="bookquote">``The Bernstein would play at cards over her (<font color='blue'><b>Brett</b></font>) niece's coffin. Talk about
her (<font color='blue'><b>Brett</b></font>) heart! who ever said she (<font color='blue'><b>Brett</b></font>) had one? That old spy lost it to the
Chevalier a thousand years ago, and has lived ever since perfectly well
without one. For how much is the Maria put in prison? If it were only a
small sum we would pay it, it would vex her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) aunt so. Find out, Fuchs, in
the morning, for how much Lady Maria Esmond is put in prison.''  (<font color='red'><b>the faithful</b></font>)</div>And the
faithful Fuchs bowed, and promised to do her (<font color='blue'><b>Yarmouth</b></font>) Excellency's will.

<p/>Meanwhile, about midnight, Madame de Bernstein went home, and presently
fell into a sound sleep, from which she (<font color='blue'><b>Yarmouth</b></font>) did not wake up until a late
hour of the morning, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Yarmouth</b></font>) summoned her (<font color='blue'><b>Yarmouth</b></font>) usual attendant, who arrived
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Yarmouth</b></font>) ladyship's morning dish of tea. If I told you she (<font color='blue'><b>Yarmouth</b></font>) took a dram
with it, you would be shocked. Some of our great-grandmothers used to
have cordials in their <div class="bookquote">``closets.''  (<font color='red'><b>great-grandmothers</b></font>)</div>Have you not read of the fine lady in
Walpole, who said, <div class="bookquote">``If I drink more, I shall be `muckibus!'?''  (<font color='red'><b>Walpole</b></font>)</div>As surely
as Mr. Gough is alive now, our ancestresses were accustomed to partake
pretty freely of strong waters.

<p/>So, having tipped off the cordial, Madame Bernstein rouses and asks Mrs.
Brett the news.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Fuchs</b></font>) can give it you,''  (<font color='red'><b>the waiting-woman</b></font>)</div>says the waiting-woman, sulkily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Fuchs</b></font>)? Who?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Brett/Brett</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Brett names Harry, and says Mr. Warrington arrived about midnight
yesterday--and Betty, my Lady Maria's maid, was with him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``And my Lady
Maria sends your ladyship her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) love and duty, and hopes you slept well,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Brett/Brett</b></font>)</div>says Brett.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Excellently, poor thing! Is Betty gone to her (<font color='blue'><b>Betty</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; she (<font color='blue'><b>Betty</b></font>) is here,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Brett/Brett</b></font>)</div>says Mrs. Brett.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let me see her (<font color='blue'><b>Betty</b></font>) directly,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>cries the old lady.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Betty</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Brett/Brett</b></font>)</div>replies the obsequious Brett, and goes away upon
her (<font color='blue'><b>Brett</b></font>) mistress's errand, leaving the old lady placidly reposing on her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
pillows. Presently, two pairs of high-heeled shoes are heard pattering
over the deal floor of the bedchamber. Carpets were luxuries scarcely
known in bedrooms of those days.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So, Mrs. Betty, you were in London yesterday?''  (<font color='red'><b>Bernstein/Madame de Bernstein/Madame Bernstein</b></font>)</div>calls Bernstein from her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
curtains.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is not Betty--it is I! Good morning, dear aunt! I hope you slept
well?''  (<font color='red'><b>Bernstein/Madame de Bernstein/Madame Bernstein</b></font>)</div>cries a voice which made old Bernstein start on her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) pillow. It
was the voice of Lady Maria, who drew the curtains aside, and dropped
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) aunt a low curtsey. Lady Maria looked very pretty, rosy, and happy.
And with the little surprise incident at her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) appearance through Madame
Bernstein's curtains, I think we may bring this chapter to a close.




<p/>CHAPTER XXXIX. Harry to the Rescue


<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear Lord March''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>-LRB-wrote Mr. Warrington from Tunbridge Wells, on
Saturday morning, the 25th August, 1756-RRB-: <div class="bookquote">``This is to inform you -LRB-with
satisfaction-RRB- that I have one all our three betts. I was at Bromley two
minutes within the hour; my new horses kep a-going at a capital rate. I
drove them myself, having the postilion by me to show me the way, and
my black man inside with Mrs. Betty. Hope they found the drive very
pleasant. We were not stopped on Blackheath, though two fellows on
horseback rode up to us, but not liking the looks of our countenantses,
rode off again; and we got into Tunbridge Wells -LRB-where I transacted my
business-RRB- at forty-five minutes after eleven. This makes me quitts with
your lordship after yesterday's piquet, which I shall be very happy to
give your revenge, and am--Your most obliged, faithful servant, H. ESMOND WARRINGTON.''


 (<font color='red'><b>Tunbridge Wells</b></font>)</div><p/>And now, perhaps, the reader will understand by what means Lady Maria
Esmond was enabled to surprise her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) dear aunt in her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) bed on Saturday
morning, and walk out of the house of captivity. Having despatched Mrs.
Betty to London, she (<font color='blue'><b>Betty</b></font>) scarcely expected that her (<font color='blue'><b>Betty</b></font>) emissary would return
on the day of her (<font color='blue'><b>Betty</b></font>) departure; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Betty</b></font>) and the chaplain were playing their
cards at midnight, after a small refection which the bailiff's wife
had provided for them, when the rapid whirling of wheels was heard
approaching their house, and caused the lady to lay her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) trumps down,
and her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) heart to beat with more than ordinary emotion. Whirr came the
wheels--the carriage stopped at the very door: there was a parley at the
gate: then appeared Mrs. Betty, with a face radiant with joy, though her (<font color='blue'><b>Betty</b></font>)
eyes were full of tears; and next, who is that tall young gentleman who
enters? Can any of my readers guess? Will they be very angry if I say
that the chaplain slapped down his (<font color='blue'><b>chaplain</b></font>) cards with a huzzay, whilst Lady
Maria, turning as white as a sheet, rose up from her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) chair, tottered
forward a step or two, and, with an hysterical shriek, flung herself in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) cousin's arms? How many kisses did he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) give her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>)? If they were mille,
deinde centum, dein mille altera, dein secunda centum, and so on, I am
not going to cry out. He (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) had come to rescue her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) knew he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) would; he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>)
was her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) champion, her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) preserver from bondage and ignominy. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) wept a
genuine flood of tears upon his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) shoulder, and as she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) reclines there,
giving way to a hearty emotion, I protest I think she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) looks handsomer
than she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) has looked during the whole course of this history. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) did not
faint this time; she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) went home, leaning lovingly on her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) cousin's arm,
and may have had one or two hysterical outbreaks in the night; but
Madame Bernstein slept soundly, and did not hear her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are both free to go home,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>were the first words Harry said. <div class="bookquote">``Get
my lady's hat and cardinal, Betty, and, Chaplain, we'll smoke a pipe
together at our lodgings, it will refresh me after my ride.''  (<font color='red'><b>The chaplain</b></font>)</div>The
chaplain, who, too, had a great deal of available sensibility, was very
much overcome; he (<font color='blue'><b>chaplain</b></font>) burst into tears as he (<font color='blue'><b>chaplain</b></font>) seized Harry's hand, and
kissed it, and prayed God to bless his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) dear, generous, young patron. Mr.
Warrington felt a glow of pleasure thrill through his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) frame. It is good
to be able to help the suffering and the poor; it is good to be able
to turn sorrow into joy. Not a little proud and elated was our young
champion, as, with his (<font color='blue'><b>champion</b></font>) hat cocked, he (<font color='blue'><b>champion</b></font>) marched by the side of his (<font color='blue'><b>champion</b></font>) rescued
princess. His (<font color='blue'><b>champion</b></font>) feelings came out to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>champion</b></font>), as it were, and beautiful
happinesses with kind eyes and smiles danced before him (<font color='blue'><b>champion</b></font>), and clad him (<font color='blue'><b>champion</b></font>) in
a robe of honour, and scattered flowers on his (<font color='blue'><b>champion</b></font>) path, and blew trumpets
and shawms of sweet gratulation, calling, <div class="bookquote">``Here comes the conqueror!
Make way for the champion!''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>And so they led him (<font color='blue'><b>champion</b></font>) up to the king's house,
and seated him (<font color='blue'><b>champion</b></font>) in the hall of complacency, upon the cushions of comfort.
And yet it was not much he (<font color='blue'><b>champion</b></font>) had done. Only a kindness. He (<font color='blue'><b>champion</b></font>) had but to put
his (<font color='blue'><b>champion</b></font>) hand in his (<font color='blue'><b>champion</b></font>) pocket, and with an easy talisman, drive off the dragon
which kept the gate, and cause the tyrant to lay down his (<font color='blue'><b>tyrant</b></font>) axe, who had
got Lady Maria in execution. Never mind if his (<font color='blue'><b>tyrant</b></font>) vanity is puffed up; he (<font color='blue'><b>tyrant</b></font>)
is very good-natured; he (<font color='blue'><b>tyrant</b></font>) has rescued two unfortunate people, and pumped
tears of goodwill and happiness out of their eyes:--and if he (<font color='blue'><b>tyrant</b></font>) brags a
little to-night, and swaggers somewhat to the chaplain, and talks about
London, and Lord March, and White's, and Almack's, with the air of a
macaroni, I don't think we need like him (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>) much the less.

<p/>Sampson continued to be prodigiously affected. This man had a nature
most easily worked upon, and extraordinarily quick to receive pain
and pleasure, to tears, gratitude, laughter, hatred, liking. In his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
preaching profession he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had educated and trained his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sensibilities so
that they were of great use to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was for the moment what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) acted.
He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wept quite genuine tears, finding that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could produce them freely.
He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) loved you whilst he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was with you; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had a real pang of grief as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
mingled his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sorrow with the widow or orphan; and, meeting Jack as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>)
came out of the door, went to the tavern opposite, and laughed and
roared over the bottle. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) gave money very readily, but never repaid
when he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) borrowed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) was on this night in a rapture of gratitude and
flattery towards Harry Warrington. In all London, perhaps, the unlucky
Fortunate Youth could not have found a more dangerous companion.

<p/>To-night he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) was in his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) grateful mood, and full of enthusiasm for the
benefactor who had released him (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) from durance. With each bumper his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>)
admiration grew stronger. He (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) exalted Harry as the best and noblest of
men, and the complacent young simpleton, as we have said, was disposed
to take these praises as very well deserved. <div class="bookquote">``The younger branch of our
family,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Harry/Mr. Harry Warrington</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Harry, with a superb air, <div class="bookquote">``have treated you scurvily;
but, by Jove, Sampson my boy, I'll stand by you!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Harry/Mr. Harry Warrington</b></font>)</div>At a certain period of
Burgundian excitement Mr. Warrington was always very eloquent respecting
the splendour of his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) family. <div class="bookquote">``I am very glad I was enabled to help you
in your strait. Count on me whenever you want me, Sampson. Did you not
say you had a sister at boarding-school? You will want money for her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>),
sir. Here is a little bill which may help to pay her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) schooling.''  (<font color='red'><b>the chaplain</b></font>)</div>And the
liberal young fellow passed a bank-note across to the chaplain.

<p/>Again the man was affected to tears. Harry's generosity smote him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Warrington,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said, putting the bank-note a short distance from
him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``I--I don't deserve your kindness--by George, I don't!''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
swore an oath to corroborate his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) passionate assertion.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Psha!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>says Harry. <div class="bookquote">``I have plenty more of `em. There was no money in
that confounded pocket-book which I lost last week.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, sir. There was no money!''  (<font color='red'><b>Sampson/Mr. Sampson</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Sampson, dropping his (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) head.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hallo! How do you know, Mr. Chaplain?''  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>asks the young gentleman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I know because I am a villain, sir. I am not worthy of your kindness.
I told you so. I found the book, sir, that night, when you had too much
wine at Barbeau's.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And read the letters?''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>asked Mr. Warrington, starting up and turning
very red.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They told me nothing I did not know, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>the chaplain</b></font>)</div>said the chaplain <div class="bookquote">``You have
had spies about you whom you little suspect--from whom you are much too
young and simple to be able to keep your secret.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the chaplain</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Are those stories about Lady Fanny, and my cousin Will and his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) doings,
true then?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>inquired Harry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, they are true,''  (<font color='red'><b>the chaplain</b></font>)</div>sighed the chaplain. <div class="bookquote">``The house of Castlewood has
not been fortunate, sir, since your honour's branch, the elder branch,
left it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sir, you don't dare for to breathe a word against my Lady Maria?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>Harry
cried out.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, not for worlds!''  (<font color='red'><b>Sampson/Mr. Sampson</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Sampson, with a queer look at his (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) young
friend. <div class="bookquote">``I may think she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) is too old for your honour, and that `tis a
pity you should not have a wife better suited to your age, though
I admit she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) looks very young for hers, and hath every virtue and
accomplishment.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) is too old, Sampson, I know she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) is,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Warrington, with much
majesty; <div class="bookquote">``but she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) has my word, and you see, sir, how fond she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) is of
me. Go bring me the letters, sir, which you found, and let me try and
forgive you for having seized upon them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My benefactor, let me try and forgive myself!''  (<font color='red'><b>Sampson/Mr. Sampson</b></font>)</div>cries Mr. Sampson, and
departed towards his (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) chamber, leaving his (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) young patron alone over his (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>)
wine.

<p/>Sampson returned presently, looking very pale. <div class="bookquote">``What has happened, sir?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>says Harry, with an imperious air.

<p/>The chaplain held out a pocket-book. <div class="bookquote">``With your name in it, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My brother's name in it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>says Harry; <div class="bookquote">``it was George who gave it to
me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I kept it in a locked chest, sir, in which I left it this morning
before I was taken by those people. Here is the book, sir, but the
letters are gone. My trunk and valise have also been tampered with. And
I am a miserable, guilty man, unable to make you the restitution which
I owe you.''  (<font color='red'><b>Sampson/Mr. Sampson</b></font>)</div>Sampson looked the picture of woe as he (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) uttered these
sentiments. He (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) clasped his (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) hands together, and almost knelt before Harry
in an attitude the most pathetic.

<p/>Who had been in the rooms in Mr. Sampson's and Mr. Warrington's absence?
The landlady was ready to go on her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) knees, and declare that nobody
had come in: nor, indeed, was Mr. Warrington's chamber in the least
disturbed, nor anything abstracted from Mr. Sampson's scanty wardrobe
and possessions, except those papers of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) deplored the absence.

<p/>Whose interest was it to seize them? Lady Maria's? The poor woman
had been a prisoner all day, and during the time when the capture was
effected.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) certainly was guiltless of the rape of the letters. The sudden
seizure of the two--Case, the house-steward's secret journey to
London,--Case, who knew the shoemaker at whose house Sampson lodged in
London, and all the secret affairs of the Esmond family,--these points,
considered together and separately, might make Mr. Sampson think that
the Baroness Bernstein was at the bottom of this mischief. But why
arrest Lady Maria? The chaplain knew nothing as yet about that letter
which her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) ladyship had lost; for poor Maria had not thought it necessary
to confide her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) secret to him (<font color='blue'><b>chaplain</b></font>).

<p/>As for the pocket-book and its contents, Mr. Harry was so swollen up
with self-satisfaction that evening, at winning his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) three bets, at
rescuing his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) two friends, at the capital premature cold supper of
partridges and ancient Burgundy which obsequious Monsieur Barbeau had
sent over to the young gentleman's lodgings, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Barbeau</b></font>) accepted Sampson's
vows of contrition, and solemn promises of future fidelity, and reached
his (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) gracious hand to the chaplain, and condoned his (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) offence. When the
latter swore his (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) great gods, that henceforth he (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) would be Harry's truest,
humblest friend and follower, and at any moment would be ready to die
for Mr. Warrington, Harry said, majestically, <div class="bookquote">``I think, Sampson, you
would; I hope you would. My family--the Esmond family--has always been
accustomed to have faithful friends round about `em--and to reward `em
too. The wine's with you, Chaplain. What toast do you call, sir?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I call a blessing on the house of Esmond-Warrington!''  (<font color='red'><b>the chaplain</b></font>)</div>cries the
chaplain, with real tears in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We are the elder branch, sir. My grandfather was the Marquis of
Esmond,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Harry/Mr. Harry Warrington</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Harry, in a voice noble but somewhat indistinct.
<div class="bookquote">``Here's to you, Chaplain--and I forgive you, sir--and God bless you,
sir--and if you had been took for three times as much, I'd have paid
it. Why, what's that I see through the shutters? I am blest if the sun
hasn't risen again! We have no need of candles to go to bed, ha, ha!''
 (<font color='red'><b>chaplain</b></font>)</div>And once more extending his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) blessing to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) chaplain, the young fellow
went off to sleep.

<p/>About noon Madame de Bernstein sent over a servant to say that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) would
be glad if her (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) nephew would come over and drink a dish of chocolate with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>), whereupon our young friend rose and walked to his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) aunt's lodgings.
She (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) remarked, not without pleasure, some alteration in his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) toilette: in
his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) brief sojourn in London he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had visited a tailor or two, and had
been introduced by my Lord March to some of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) lordship's purveyors and
tradesmen.

<p/>Aunt Bernstein called him (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``my dearest child,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>and thanked him (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>) for his (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>)
noble, his (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>) generous behaviour to dear Maria. What a shock that seizure
in church had been to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>)! A still greater shock that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) had lost three
hundred only on the Wednesday night to Lady Yarmouth, and was quite a
sec. <div class="bookquote">``Why,''  (<font color='red'><b>Baroness/Baroness Bernstein/Bernstein</b></font>)</div>said the Baroness, <div class="bookquote">``I had to send Case to London to my agent
to get me money to pay--I could not leave Tunbridge in her (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) debt.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Baroness/Baroness Bernstein/Bernstein</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So Case did go to London?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Harry/Mr. Harry Warrington</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Harry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course he (<font color='blue'><b>Tunbridge</b></font>) did: the Baroness de Bernstein can't afford to say she (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) is
court d’argent. Canst thou lend me some, child?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can give your ladyship twenty-two pounds,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>said Harry, blushing very
red: <div class="bookquote">``I have but forty-four left till I get my Virginian remittances. I
have bought horses and clothes, and been very extravagant, aunt.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And rescued your poor relations in distress, you prodigal good boy.
No, child, I do not want thy money. I can give thee some. Here is a note
upon my agent for fifty pounds, vaurien! Go and spend it, and be merry!
I dare say thy mother will repay me, though she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) does not love me.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And
she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) looked quite affectionate, and held out a pretty hand, which the
youth kissed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your mother did not love me, but your mother's father did once. Mind,
sir, you always come to me when you have need of me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Beatrix</b></font>)</div><p/>When bent on exhibiting them, nothing could exceed Beatrix Bernstein's
grace or good-humour. <div class="bookquote">``I can't help loving you, child,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrix</b></font>) continued,
<div class="bookquote">``and yet I am so angry with you that I have scarce the patience to speak
to you. So you have actually engaged yourself to poor Maria, who is
as old as your mother? What will Madam Esmond say? She (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) may live three
hundred years, and you will not have wherewithal to support yourselves.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have ten thousand pounds from my father, of my own, now my poor
brother is gone,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>said Harry, <div class="bookquote">``that will go some way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, the interest will not keep you in card-money.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We must give up cards,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>says Harry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is more than Maria is capable of. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) will pawn the coat off your
back to play. The rage for it runs in all my brother's family--in me
too, I own it. I warned you. I prayed you not to play with them, and
now a lad of twenty to engage himself to a woman of forty-two!--to write
letters on his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) knees and signed with his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) heart's blood -LRB-which he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) spells
like hartshorn-RRB-, and say that he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) will marry no other woman than his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>)
adorable cousin, Lady Maria Esmond. Oh! it's cruel--cruel!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Great heavens! madam, who showed you my letter?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>asked Harry, burning
with a blush again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``An accident. She (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>) fainted when she (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>) was taken by those bailiffs. Brett
cut her (<font color='blue'><b>Brett</b></font>) laces for her (<font color='blue'><b>Brett</b></font>); and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Brett</b></font>) was carried off, poor thing, we
found a little sachet on the floor, which I opened, not knowing in the
least what it contained. And in it was Mr. Harry Warrington's precious
letter. And here, sir, is the case.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div><p/>A pang shot through Harry's heart. <div class="bookquote">``Great heavens! why didn't she (<font color='blue'><b>Brett</b></font>)
destroy it?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) thought.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I--I will give it back to Maria,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said, stretching out his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hand for
the little locket.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear, I have burned the foolish letter,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>said the old lady.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you choose to betray me I must take the consequence. If you choose
to write another, I cannot help thee. But, in that case, Harry Esmond,
I had rather never see thee again. Will you keep my secret? Will you
believe an old woman who loves you and knows the world better than you
do? I tell you, if you keep that foolish promise, misery and ruin are
surely in store for you. What is a lad like you in the hands of a wily
woman of the world, who makes a toy of you? She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) has entrapped you into a
promise, and your old aunt has cut the strings and set you free. Go back
again! Betray me if you will, Harry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not angry with you, aunt--I wish I were,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Warrington,
with very great emotion. <div class="bookquote">``I--I shall not repeat what you told me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Maria never will, child--mark my words!''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>cried the old lady, eagerly.
<div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) will never own that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) has lost that paper. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) will tell you that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) has it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I am sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>)--she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) is very fond of me; you should have seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>)
last night,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>faltered Harry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Must I tell more stories against my own flesh and blood?''  (<font color='red'><b>the Baroness</b></font>)</div>sobs out the
Baroness. <div class="bookquote">``Child, you do not know her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) past life!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And I must not, and I will not!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>cries Harry, starting up. <div class="bookquote">``Written or
said--it does not matter which! But my word is given; they may play with
such things in England, but we gentlemen of Virginia don't break `em.
If she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) holds me to my word, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) shall have me. If we are miserable, as
I dare say we shall be, I'll take a firelock, and go join the King of
Prussia, or let a ball put an end to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I--I have no more to say. Will you be pleased to ring that bell? I--I
wish you a good morning, Mr. Warrington,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>and dropping a very stately
curtsey, the old lady rose on her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) tortoiseshell stick, and turned
towards the door. But, as she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) made her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) first step, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) put her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) hand
to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) heart, sank on the sofa again, an shed the first tears that had
dropped for long years from Beatrix Esmond's eyes.

<p/>Harry was greatly moved, too. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) knelt down by her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) seized her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) cold
hand, and kissed it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) told her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>), in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) artless way, how very keenly he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
had felt her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) love for him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), and how, with all his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) heart, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) returned it.
<div class="bookquote">``Ah, aunt!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``you don't know what a villain I feel myself. When
you told me, just now how that paper was burned--oh! I was ashamed to
think how glad I was.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) bowed his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) comely head over her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) hand. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) felt
hot drops from his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) eyes raining on it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) had loved this boy. For half
a century past--never, perhaps, in the course of her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) whole worldly
life, had she (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) felt a sensation so tender and so pure. The hard heart was
wounded now, softened, overcome. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) put her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) two hands on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) shoulders,
and lightly kissed his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) forehead.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You will not tell her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) what I have done, child?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) said.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) declared never! never! And demure Mrs. Brett, entering at her (<font color='blue'><b>Brett</b></font>)
mistress's summons, found the nephew and aunt in this sentimental
attitude.




<p/>CHAPTER XL. In which Harry pays off an Old Debt, and incurs some New
Ones


<p/>Our Tunbridge friends were now weary of the Wells, and eager to take
their departure. When the autumn should arrive, Bath was Madame de
Bernstein's mark. There were more cards, company, life, there. She (<font color='blue'><b>Brett</b></font>)
would reach it after paying a few visits to her (<font color='blue'><b>Brett</b></font>) country friends. Harry
promised, with rather a bad grace, to ride with Lady Maria and the
chaplain to Castlewood. Again they passed by Oakhurst village, and the
hospitable house where Harry had been so kindly entertained. Maria
made so many keen remarks about the young ladies of Oakhurst, and their
setting their caps at Harry, and the mother's evident desire to catch
him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) for one of them, that, somewhat in a pet, Mr. Warrington said he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>)
would pass his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) friends' door, as her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) ladyship disliked and abused
them; and was very haughty and sulky that evening at the inn where they
stopped, some few miles farther on the road. At supper, my Lady Maria's
smiles brought no corresponding good-humour to Harry's face; her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) tears
-LRB-which her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) ladyship had at command-RRB- did not seem to create the least
sympathy from Mr. Warrington; to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) querulous remarks he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) growled a
surly reply; and my lady was obliged to go to bed at length without
getting a single tete-a-tete with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) cousin,--that obstinate chaplain,
as if by order, persisting in staying in the room. Had Harry given
Sampson orders to remain? She (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) departed with a sigh. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) bowed her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) to the
door with an obstinate politeness, and consigned her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) to the care of the
landlady and her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) maid.

<p/>What horse was that which galloped out of the inn-yard ten minutes after
Lady Maria had gone to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) chamber? An hour after her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) departure
from their supper-room, Mrs. Betty came in for her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) lady's bottle of
smelling-salts, and found Parson Sampson smoking a pipe alone.
Mr. Warrington was gone to bed--was gone to fetch a walk in the
moonlight--how should he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) know where Mr. Harry was? Sampson answered,
in reply to the maid's interrogatories. Mr. Warrington was ready to set
forward the next morning, and took his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) place by the side of Lady Maria's
carriage. But his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) brow was black--the dark spirit was still on him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>)
hardly spoke to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) during the journey. <div class="bookquote">``Great heavens! she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) must have
told him (<font color='blue'><b>villain</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) stole it!''  (<font color='red'><b>Maria/Lady Maria/Lady Maria Esmond</b></font>)</div>thought Lady Maria within her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) own mind.

<p/>The fact is, that, as they were walking up that steep hill which lies
about three miles from Oakhurst, on the Westerham road, Lady Maria
Esmond, leaning on her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) fond youth's arm, and indeed very much in love
with him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>), had warbled into his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) ear the most sentimental vows, protests,
and expressions of affection. As she (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) grew fonder, he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) grew colder. As she (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>)
looked up in his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) face, the sun shone down upon hers, which, fresh and
well-preserved as it was, yet showed some of the lines and wrinkles of
twoscore years; and poor Harry, with that arm leaning on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), felt it
intolerably weighty, and by no means relished his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) walk up the hill. To
think that all his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) life, that drag was to be upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)! It was a dreary
look forward and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) cursed the moonlight walk, and the hot evening, and
the hot wine which had made him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) give that silly pledge by which he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was
fatally bound.

<p/>Maria's praises and raptures annoyed Harry beyond measure. The poor
thing poured out scraps of the few plays which she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) knew that had
reference to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) case, and strove with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) utmost power to charm her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>)
young companion. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) called him (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>), over and over again, her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) champion, her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>)
Henrico, her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) preserver, and vowed that his (<font color='blue'><b>champion</b></font>) Molinda would be ever, ever
faithful to him (<font color='blue'><b>champion</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) clung to him (<font color='blue'><b>champion</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Ah, child! have I not thy precious
image, thy precious hair, thy precious writing here?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) said, looking
in his (<font color='blue'><b>champion</b></font>) face. <div class="bookquote">``Shall it not go with me to the grave? It would, sir, were
I to meet with unkindness from my Henrico!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) sighed out.

<p/>Here was a strange story! Madame Bernstein had given him (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>) the little
silken case--she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) had burned the hair and the note which the case
contained, and Maria had it still on her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) heart! It was then, at the
start which Harry gave, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) was leaning on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) arm--at the sudden
movement as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) would drop hers--that Lady Maria felt her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) first pang
of remorse that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) had told a fib, or rather, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) was found out in
telling a fib, which is a far more cogent reason for repentance. Heaven
help us! if some people were to do penance for telling lies, would they
ever be out of sackcloth and ashes?

<p/>Arrived at Castlewood, Mr. Harry's good-humour was not increased. My
lord was from home; the ladies also were away; the only member of
the family whom Harry found, was Mr. Will, who returned from
partridge-shooting just as the chaise and cavalcade reached the gate,
and who turned very pale when he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) saw his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) cousin, and received a sulky
scowl of recognition from the young Virginian.

<p/>Nevertheless, he (<font color='blue'><b>Virginian</b></font>) thought to put a good face on the matter, and they met
at supper, where, before my Lady Maria, their conversation was at first
civil, but not lively. Mr. Will had been to some races? To several. He (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>)
had been pretty successful in his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) bets? Mr. Warrington hopes. Pretty
well. <div class="bookquote">``And you have brought back my horse sound?''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>asked Mr. Warrington.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your horse! what horse?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Will/Will/Will Esmond</b></font>)</div>asked Mr. Will.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What horse? my horse!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Harry/Mr. Harry Warrington</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Harry, curtly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Protest I don't understand you,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>says Will.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The brown horse for which I played you, and which I won of you the
night before you rode away upon it,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Warrington, sternly. <div class="bookquote">``You
remember the horse, Mr. Esmond.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Warrington, I perfectly well remember playing you for a horse,
which my servant handed over to you on the day of your departure.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The chaplain was present at our play. Mr. Sampson, will you be umpire
between us?''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>Mr. Warrington said, with much gentleness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am bound to decide that Mr. Warrington played for the brown horse,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sampson/Mr. Sampson</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Sampson.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) got the other one,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Will/Will/Will Esmond</b></font>)</div>said sulky Mr. Will, with a grin.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And sold it for thirty shillings!''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Warrington, always
preserving his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) calm tone.

<p/>Will was waggish. <div class="bookquote">``Thirty shillings? and a devilish good price, too, for
the broken-kneed old rip. Ha, ha!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not a word more. `Tis only a question about a bet, my dear Lady Maria.
Shall I serve you some more chicken?''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>Nothing could be more studiously
courteous and gay than Mr. Warrington was, so long as the lady remained
in the room. When she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) rose to go, Harry followed her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) to the door, and
closed it upon her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) with the most courtly bow of farewell. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) stood at
the closed door for a moment, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) bade the servants retire. When
those menials were gone, Mr. Warrington locked the heavy door before
them, and pocketed the key.

<p/>As it clicked in the lock, Mr. Will, who had been sitting over his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>)
punch, looking now and then askance at his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) cousin, asked, with one
of the oaths which commonly garnished his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) conversation, what the--Mr.
Warrington meant by that?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I guess there's going to be a quarrel,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Warrington, blandly,
<div class="bookquote">``and there is no use in having these fellows look on at rows between
their betters.''

 (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who is going to quarrel here, I should like to know?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>asked Will,
looking very pale, and grasping a knife.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Sampson, you were present when I played Mr. Will fifty guineas
against his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) brown horse?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Against his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) horse!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Will/Will/Will Esmond</b></font>)</div>bawls out Mr. Will.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not such a something fool as you take me for,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>says Mr.
Warrington, <div class="bookquote">``although I do come from Virginia!''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) repeated his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>)
question: <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Sampson, you were here when I played the Honourable
William Esmond, Esquire, fifty guineas against his (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) brown horse?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I must own it, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>the chaplain</b></font>)</div>says the chaplain, with a deprecatory look towards
his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) lord's brother.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't own no such a thing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Will/Will/Will Esmond</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Will, with rather a forced
laugh.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, sir: because it costs you no more pains to lie than to cheat,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>said
Mr. Warrington, walking up to his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) cousin. <div class="bookquote">``Hands off, Mr. Chaplain, and
see fair play! Because you are no better than a--ha!--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div><p/>No better than a what we can't say, and shall never know, for as Harry
uttered the exclamation, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) dear cousin flung a wine bottle at Mr.
Warrington's head, who bobbed just in time, so that the missile flew
across the room, and broke against the wainscot opposite, breaking
the face of a pictured ancestor of the Esmond family, and then itself
against the wall, whence it spirted a pint of good port wine over the
chaplain's face and flowered wig. <div class="bookquote">``Great heavens, gentlemen, I pray you
to be quiet!''  (<font color='red'><b>the parson</b></font>)</div>cried the parson, dripping with gore.

<p/>But gentlemen are not inclined at some moments to remember the commands
of the Church. The bottle having failed, Mr. Esmond seized the large
silver-handled knife and drove at his (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) cousin. But Harry caught up
the other's right hand with his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) left, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had seen the boxers do at
Marybone; and delivered a rapid blow upon Mr. Esmond's nose, which sent
him (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) reeling up against the oak panels, and I dare say caused him (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) to see
ten thousand illuminations. He (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) dropped his (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) knife in his (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) retreat against
the wall, which his (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) rapid antagonist kicked under the table.

<p/>Now Will, too, had been at Marybone and Hockley-in-the-Hole, and after
a gasp for breath and a glare over his (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) bleeding nose at his (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) enemy, he (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>)
dashed forward his (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) head as though it had been a battering-ram, intending
to project it into Mr. Henry Warrington's stomach.

<p/>This manoeuvre Harry had seen, too, on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) visit to Marybone, and
amongst the negroes upon the maternal estate, who would meet in combat
like two concutient cannon-balls, each harder than the other. But Harry
had seen and marked the civilised practice of the white man. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) skipped
aside, and, saluting his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) advancing enemy with a tremendous blow on the
right ear, felled him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) struck his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) head against the heavy oak
table and sank lifeless to the ground.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Chaplain, you will bear witness that it has been a fair fight!''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>said
Mr. Warrington, still quivering with the excitement of the combat, but
striving with all his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) might to restrain himself and look cool. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>)
drew the key from his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) pocket and opened the door in the lobby, behind
which three or four servants were gathered. A crash of broken glass, a
cry, a shout, an oath or two, had told them that some violent scene was
occurring within, and they entered, and behold two victims bedabbled
with red--the chaplain bleeding port wine, and the Honourable William
Esmond, Esquire, stretched in his (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) own gore.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Sampson will bear witness that I struck fair, and that Mr.
Esmond hit the first blow,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Warrington. <div class="bookquote">``Undo his (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) neckcloth,
somebody--he (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) may be dead; and get a fleam, Gumbo, and bleed him (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>). Stop!
He (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) is coming to himself! Lift him (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) up, you, and tell a maid to wash the
floor.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Will/Will/Will Esmond</b></font>)</div><p/>Indeed, in a minute, Mr. Will did come to himself. First his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) eyes rolled
about, or rather, I am ashamed to say, his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) eye, one having been closed
by Mr. Warrington's first blow. First, then, his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) eye rolled about; then
he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) gasped and uttered an inarticulate moan or two, then he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) began to
swear and curse very freely and articulately.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) is getting well,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Warrington.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, praise be Mussy!''  (<font color='red'><b>Betty/Mrs. Betty</b></font>)</div>sighs the sentimental Betty.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>), Gumbo, whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) would like any more?''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Warrington,
with a stern humour.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Massa Harry say, wool you like any maw?''  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>asked obedient Gumbo, bowing
over the prostrate gentleman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, curse you, you black devil!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Will/Will/Will Esmond</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Will, hitting up at the black
object before him (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>). -LRB-<div class="bookquote">``So he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) nearly cut my tongue in to in my mouf!''  (<font color='red'><b>Betty/Mrs. Betty</b></font>)</div>Gumbo
explained to the pitying Betty.-RRB- <div class="bookquote">``No, that is, yes! You infernal Mohock!
Why does not somebody kick him (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) out of the place?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because nobody dares, Mr. Esmond,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Warrington, with great
state, arranging his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) ruffles--his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) ruffled ruffles.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And nobody won't neither,''  (<font color='red'><b>the men</b></font>)</div>growled the men. They had all grown to love
Harry, whereas Mr. Will had nobody's good word.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We know all's fair, sir. It ain't the first time Master William have
been served so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And I hope it won't be the last,''  (<font color='red'><b>Betty/Mrs. Betty</b></font>)</div>cries shrill Betty. <div class="bookquote">``To go for to
strike a poor black gentleman so!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Will/Will/Will Esmond</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Will had gathered himself up by this time, had wiped his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) bleeding
face with a napkin, and was skulking off to bed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Surely it's manners to say good night to the company. Good night, Mr.
Esmond,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Warrington, whose jokes, though few, were not very
brilliant; but the honest lad relished the brilliant sally and laughed
at it inwardly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>)'s ad his (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) zopper, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) goes to baid!''  (<font color='red'><b>Betty/Mrs. Betty</b></font>)</div>says Betty, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Betty</b></font>) native
dialect, at which everybody laughed outright, except Mr. William, who
went away leaving a black fume of curses, as it were, rolling out of
that funnel, his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) mouth.

<p/>It must be owned that Mr. Warrington continued to be witty the next
morning. He (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) sent a note to Mr. Will begging to know whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) was for
a ride to town or anywheres else. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) was for London, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) would
friten the highwaymen on Hounslow Heath, and look a very genteel figar
at the Chocolate House. Which letter, I fear, Mr. Will received with his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>)
usual violence, requesting the writer to go to some place--not Hounslow.

<p/>And, besides the parley between Will and Harry, there comes a maiden
simpering to Mr. Warrington's door, and Gumbo advances, holding
something white and triangular in his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) ebon fingers.

<p/>Harry knew what it was well enough. <div class="bookquote">``Of course it's a letter,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>groans
he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). Molinda greets her (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) Enrico, etc. etc. etc.. No sleep has she (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) known
that night, and so forth, and so forth, and so forth. Has Enrico slept
well in the halls of his (<font color='blue'><b>Enrico</b></font>) fathers? und so weiter, und so weiter. He (<font color='blue'><b>Enrico</b></font>) must
never never quaril and be so cruel again. Kai ta loipa. And I protest I
shan't quote any more of this letter. Ah, tablets, golden once,--are ye
now faded leaves? Where is the juggler who transmuted you, and why is
the glamour over?

<p/>After the little scandal with cousin Will, Harry's dignity would not
allow him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) to stay longer at Castlewood: he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wrote a majestic letter
to the lord of the mansion, explaining the circumstances which had
occurred, and, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) called in Parson Sampson to supervise the document,
no doubt it contained none of those eccentricities in spelling which
figured in his (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) ordinary correspondence at this period. He (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) represented to
poor Maria, that after blackening the eye and damaging the nose of a son
of the house, he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) should remain in it with a very bad grace; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) was
forced to acquiesce in the opinion that, for the present, his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) absence
would best become him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>). Of course, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) wept plentiful tears at parting
with him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) would go to London, and see younger beauties: he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) would find
none, none who would love him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) like his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) fond Maria. I fear Mr. Warrington
did not exhibit any profound emotion on leaving her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>): nay, he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) cheered
up immediately after he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) crossed Castlewood Bridge, and made his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) horses
whisk over the road at ten miles an hour: he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) sang to them to go along:
he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) nodded to the pretty girls by the roadside: he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) chucked my landlady
under the chin: he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) certainly was not inconsolable. Truth is, he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>)
longed to be back in London again, to make a figure at St. James's,
at Newmarket, wherever the men of fashion congregated. All that petty
Tunbridge society of women and card-playing seemed child's-play to him (<font color='blue'><b>Tunbridge</b></font>)
now he (<font color='blue'><b>Tunbridge</b></font>) had tasted the delight of London life.

<p/>By the time he (<font color='blue'><b>Tunbridge</b></font>) reached London again, almost all the four-and-forty
pounds which we have seen that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tunbridge</b></font>) possessed at Tunbridge had slipped out
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tunbridge</b></font>) pocket, and further supplies were necessary. Regarding these he (<font color='blue'><b>Tunbridge</b></font>)
made himself presently easy. There were the two sums of 5000 pounds in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Tunbridge</b></font>) own and his (<font color='blue'><b>Tunbridge</b></font>) brother's name, of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Tunbridge</b></font>) was the master. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tunbridge</b></font>) would
take up a little money, and with a run or two of good luck at play he (<font color='blue'><b>Tunbridge</b></font>)
could easily replace it. Meantime he (<font color='blue'><b>Tunbridge</b></font>) must live in a manner becoming his (<font color='blue'><b>Tunbridge</b></font>)
station, and it must be explained to Madam Esmond that a gentleman
of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) rank cannot keep fitting company, and appear as becomes him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) in
society, upon a miserable pittance of two hundred a year.

<p/>Mr. Warrington sojourned at the Bedford Coffee-House as before, but only
for a short while. He (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) sought out proper lodgings at the Court end of the
town, and fixed on some apartments in Bond Street, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Bond</b></font>) and
Gumbo installed themselves, his (<font color='blue'><b>Bond</b></font>) horses standing at a neighbouring
livery-stable. And now tailors, mercers, and shoemakers were put in
requisition. Not without a pang of remorse, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bond</b></font>) laid aside his (<font color='blue'><b>Bond</b></font>) mourning
and figured in a laced hat and waistcoat. Gumbo was always dexterous in
the art of dressing hair, and with a little powder flung into his (<font color='blue'><b>Bond</b></font>) fair
locks Mr. Warrington's head was as modish as that of any gentleman in
the Mall. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bond</b></font>) figured in the Ring in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bond</b></font>) phaeton. Reports of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bond</b></font>) great
wealth had long since preceded him (<font color='blue'><b>Bond</b></font>) to London, and not a little curiosity
was excited about the fortunate Virginian.

<p/>Until our young friend could be balloted for at the proper season,
my Lord March had written down his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) name for the club at White's
Chocolate-House, as a distinguished gentleman from America. There were
as yet but few persons of fashion in London, but with a pocket full of
money at one-and-twenty, a young fellow can make himself happy even out
of the season; and Mr. Harry was determined to enjoy.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) ordered Mr. Draper, then, to sell five hundred pounds of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) stock.
What would his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) poor mother have said had she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) known that the young
spendthrift was already beginning to dissipate his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) patrimony? He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) dined
at the tavern, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) supped at the club, where Jack Morris introduced him (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>),
with immense eulogiums, to such gentlemen as were in town. Life and
youth and pleasure were before him (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>), the wine was set a-running, and the
eager lad was greedy to drink. Do you see, far away in the west yonder,
the pious widow at her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) prayers for her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) son? Behind the trees at Oakhurst
a tender little heart, too, is beating for him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>), perhaps. When the
Prodigal Son was away carousing, were not love and forgiveness still on
the watch for him (<font color='blue'><b>Son</b></font>)?

<p/>Amongst the inedited letters of the late Lord Orford, there is one which
the present learned editor, Mr. Peter Cunningbam, has omitted from his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>)
collection, doubting possibly the authenticity of the document. Nay,
I myself have only seen a copy of it in the Warrington papers in Madam
Esmond's prim handwriting, and noted <div class="bookquote">``Mr. H. Walpole's account of my son
Henry at London, and of Baroness Tusher,--wrote to General Conway.''


 (<font color='red'><b>Madam Esmond/Madam Esmond Warrington/Madam Warrington</b></font>)</div><p/>``ARLINGTON STREET, Friday Night.

<p/>``I have come away, child, for a day or two from my devotions to our Lady
of Strawberry. Have I not been on my knees to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) these three weeks,
and aren't the poor old joints full of rheumatism? A fit took me that
I would pay London a visit, that I would go to Vauxhall and Ranelagh.
Quoi! May I not have my rattle as well as other elderly babies? Suppose,
after being so long virtuous, I take a fancy to cakes and ale, shall
your reverence say nay to me? George Selwyn and Tony Storer and
your humble servant took boat at Westminster t'other night. Was it
Tuesday?--no, Tuesday I was with their Graces of Norfolk, who are just
from Tunbridge--it was Wednesday. How should I know? Wasn't I dead drunk
with a whole pint of lemonade I took at White's?

<p/>``The Norfolk folk had been entertaining me on Tuesday with the account
of a young savage Iroquois, Choctaw, or Virginian, who has lately been
making a little noise in our quarter of the globe. He (<font color='blue'><b>Virginian</b></font>) is an offshoot of
that disreputable family of Esmond, Castlewood, of whom all the men are
gamblers and spendthrifts, and all the women--well, I shan't say the
word, lest Lady Ailesbury should be looking over your shoulder. Both the
late lords, my father told me, were in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) pay, and the last one, a beau
of Queen Anne's reign, from a viscount advanced to be an earl through
the merits and intercession of his (<font color='blue'><b>earl</b></font>) notorious old sister Bernstein, late
Tusher, nee Esmond--a great beauty, too, of her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) day, a favourite of the
old Pretender. She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) sold his (<font color='blue'><b>Tusher</b></font>) secrets to my papa, who paid her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) for them;
and being nowise particular in her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) love for the Stuarts, came over to
the august Hanoverian house at present reigning over us. `Will Horace
Walpole's tongue never stop scandal?' says your wife over your shoulder.
I kiss your ladyship's hand. I am dumb. The Bernstein is a model of
virtue. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had no good reasons for marrying her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) father's chaplain.
Many of the nobility omit the marriage altogether. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) wasn't ashamed
of being Mrs. Tusher, and didn't take a German Baroncino for a second
husband, whom nobody out of Hanover ever saw. The Yarmouth bears no
malice. Esther and Vashti are very good friends, and have been cheating
each other at Tunbridge at cards all the summer.

<p/>```And what has all this to do with the Iroquois?' says your ladyship.
The Iroquois has been at Tunbridge, too--not cheating, perhaps, but
winning vastly. They say he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) has bled Lord March of thousands--Lord
March, by whom so much blood hath been shed, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) has quarrelled with
everybody, fought with everybody, rode over everybody, been fallen in
love with by everybody's wife except Mr. Conway's, and not excepting her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
present Majesty, the Countess of England, Scotland, France and Ireland,
Queen of Walmoden and Yarmouth, whom Heaven preserve to us.

<p/>``You know an offensive little creature, de par le monde, one Jack
Morris, who skips in and out of all the houses of London. When we were
at Vauxhall, Mr. Jack gave us a nod under the shoulder of a pretty young
fellow enough, on whose arm he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) was leaning, and who appeared hugely
delighted with the enchantments of the garden. Lord, how he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) stared
at the fireworks! Gods, how he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) huzzayed at the singing of a horrible
painted wench who shrieked the ears off my head! A twopenny string of
glass beads and a strip of tawdry cloth are treasures in Iroquois-land,
and our savage valued them accordingly.

<p/>``A buzz went about the place that this was the fortunate youth. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) won
three hundred at White's last night very genteelly from Rockingham and
my precious nephew, and here he (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) was bellowing and huzzaying over the
music so as to do you good to hear. I do not love a puppet-show, but I
love to treat children to one, Miss Conway! I present your ladyship my
compliments, and hope we shall go and see the dolls together.

<p/>``When the singing woman came down from her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) throne, Jack Morris must
introduce my Virginian to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) blush up to the eyes, and make
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), upon my word, a very fine bow, such as I had no idea was practised
in wigwams. `There is a certain jenny squaw about her (<font color='blue'><b>jenny</b></font>), and that's why
the savage likes her (<font color='blue'><b>jenny</b></font>),' George said--a joke certainly not as brilliant as
a firework. After which it seemed to me that the savage and the savages
retired together.

<p/>``Having had a great deal too much to eat and drink three hours before,
my partners must have chicken and rack-punch at Vauxhall, where George
fell asleep straightway, and for my sins I must tell Tony Storer what
I knew about this Virginian's amiable family, especially some of the
Bernstein's antecedents, and the history of another elderly beauty of
the family, a certain Lady Maria, who was au mieux with the late Prince
of Wales. What did I say? I protest not half of what I knew, and of
course not a tenth part of what I was going to tell, for who should
start out upon us but my savage, this time quite red in the face; and in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) war paint. The wretch had been drinking fire-water in the next box!

<p/>``He (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) cocked his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) hat, clapped his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) hand to his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) sword, asked which of the
gentleman was it that was maligning his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) family? so that I was obliged to
entreat him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) not to make such a noise, lest he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) should wake my friend, Mr.
George Selwyn. And I added, `I assure you, sir, I had no idea that you
were near me, and most sincerely apologise for giving you pain.'

<p/>``The Huron took his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) hand off his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) tomahawk at this pacific rejoinder,
made a bow not ungraciously, said he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) could not, of course, ask more than
an apology from a gentleman of my age -LRB-Merci, monsieur!-RRB-, and, hearing
the name of Mr. Selwyn, made another bow to George, and said he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) had
a letter to him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) from Lord March, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) had had the ill-fortune to
mislay. George has put him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) up for the club, it appears, in conjunction
with March, and no doubt these three lambs will fleece each other.
Meanwhile, my pacified savage sate down with us, and buried the hatchet
in another bowl of punch, for which these gentlemen must call. Heaven
help us! `Tis eleven o’clock, and here comes Bedson with my gruel! H. W.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``To the Honourable. H. S. Conway.''




 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER XLI. Rake's Progress


<p/>People were still very busy in Harry Warrington's time -LRB-not that our
young gentleman took much heed of the controversy-RRB- in determining
the relative literary merits of the ancients and the moderns; and the
learned, and the world with them, indeed, pretty generally pronounced in
favour of the former. The moderns of that day are the ancients of
ours, and we speculate upon them in the present year of grace, as our
grandchildren, a hundred years hence, will give their judgment about us.
As for your book-learning, O respectable ancestors -LRB-though, to be sure,
you have the mighty Gibbon with you-RRB-, I think you will own that you
are beaten, and could point to a couple of professors at Cambridge and
Glasgow who know more Greek than was to be had in your time in all
the universities of Europe, including that of Athens, if such an one
existed. As for science, you were scarce more advanced than those
heathen to whom in literature you owned yourselves inferior. And in
public and private morality? Which is the better, this actual year 1858,
or its predecessor a century back? Gentlemen of Mr. Disraeli's House of
Commons! has every one of you his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) price, as in Walpole's or Newcastle's
time,--or -LRB-and that is the delicate question-RRB- have you almost all of you
had it? Ladies, I do not say that you are a society of Vestals--but the
chronicle of a hundred years since contains such an amount of scandal,
that you may be thankful you did not live in such dangerous times. No:
on my conscience, I believe that men and women are both better; not only
that the Susannas are more numerous, but that the Elders are not nearly
so wicked. Did you ever hear of such books as Clarissa, Tom Jones,
Roderick Random; paintings by contemporary artists, of the men and
women, the life and society, of their day? Suppose we were to describe
the doings of such a person as Mr. Lovelace or my Lady Bellaston, or
that wonderful <div class="bookquote">``Lady of Quality''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady</b></font>)</div>who lent her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) memoirs to the author of
Peregrine Pickle. How the pure and outraged Nineteenth Century would
blush, scream, run out of the room, call away the young ladies, and
order Mr. Mudie never to send one of that odious author's books again!
You are fifty-eight years old, madam, and it may be that you are too
squeamish, that you cry out before you are hurt, and when nobody had
any intention of offending your ladyship. Also, it may be that the
novelist's art is injured by the restraints put upon him (<font color='blue'><b>novelist</b></font>) as many an
honest, harmless statue at St. Peter's and the Vatican is spoiled by the
tin draperies in which ecclesiastical old women have swaddled the fair
limbs of the marble. But in your prudery there is reason. So there is in
the state censorship of the Press. The page may contain matter dangerous
to bonos mores. Out with your scissors, censor, and clip off the
prurient paragraph! We have nothing for it but to submit. Society, the
despot, has given his (<font color='blue'><b>despot</b></font>) imperial decree. We may think the statue had been
seen to greater advantage without the tin drapery; we may plead that the
moral were better might we recite the whole fable. Away with him (<font color='blue'><b>despot</b></font>)--not a
word! I never saw the pianofortes in the United States with the frilled
muslin trousers on their legs; but, depend on it, the muslin covered
some of the notes as well as the mahogany, muffled the music, and
stopped the player.

<p/>To what does this prelude introduce us? I am thinking of Harry
Warrington, Esquire, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) lodgings in Bond Street, London, and of the
life which he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) and many of the young bucks of fashion led in those times,
and how I can no more take my faire young reader into them, than
Lady Squeams can take her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) daughter to Cremorne Gardens on an ordinary
evening. My dear Miss Diana -LRB-psha! I know you are eight-and-thirty,
although you are so wonderfully shy, and want to make us believe
you have just left off schoolroom dinners and a pinafore-RRB-, when your
grandfather was a young man about town, and a member of one of the clubs
at White's, and dined at Pontac's off the feasts provided by Braund and
Lebeck, and rode to Newmarket with March and Rockingham, and toasted
the best in England with Gilly Williams and George Selwyn -LRB-and didn't
understand George's jokes, of which, indeed, the flavour has very much
evaporated since the bottling-RRB---the old gentleman led a life of which
your noble aunt -LRB-author of Legends of the Squeams's; or, Fair Fruits of
a Family Tree-RRB- has not given you the slightest idea.

<p/>It was before your grandmother adopted those serious views for which
she (<font color='blue'><b>grandmother</b></font>) was distinguished during her (<font color='blue'><b>grandmother</b></font>) last long residence at Bath, and after
Colonel Tibbalt married Miss Lye, the rich soap-boiler's heiress, that
her (<font color='blue'><b>heiress</b></font>) ladyship's wild oats were sown. When she (<font color='blue'><b>heiress</b></font>) was young, she (<font color='blue'><b>heiress</b></font>) was as giddy
as the rest of the genteel world. At her (<font color='blue'><b>heiress</b></font>) house in Hill Street, she (<font color='blue'><b>heiress</b></font>) had
ten card-tables on Wednesdays and Sunday evenings, except for a short
time when Ranelagh was open on Sundays. Every night of her (<font color='blue'><b>heiress</b></font>) life she (<font color='blue'><b>heiress</b></font>)
gambled for eight, nine, ten hours. Everybody else in society did the
like. She (<font color='blue'><b>heiress</b></font>) lost; she (<font color='blue'><b>heiress</b></font>) won; she (<font color='blue'><b>heiress</b></font>) cheated; she (<font color='blue'><b>heiress</b></font>) pawned her (<font color='blue'><b>heiress</b></font>) jewels; who knows
what else she (<font color='blue'><b>heiress</b></font>) was not ready to pawn, so as to find funds to supply her (<font color='blue'><b>heiress</b></font>)
fury for play? What was that after-supper duel at the Shakspeare's Head
in Covent Garden, between your grandfather and Colonel Tibbalt: where
they drew swords and engaged only in the presence of Sir John Screwby,
who was drunk under the table? They were interrupted by Mr. John
Fielding's people, and your grandfather was carried home to Hill Street
wounded in a chair. I tell you those gentlemen in powder and ruffles,
who turned out the toes of their buckled pumps so delicately, were
terrible fellows. Swords were perpetually being drawn; bottles
after bottles were drunk; oaths roared unceasingly in conversation;
tavern-drawers and watchmen were pinked and maimed; chairmen belaboured;
citizens insulted by reeling pleasure-hunters. You have been to Cremorne
with proper <div class="bookquote">``vouchers''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>of course? Do you remember our great theatres
thirty years ago? You were too good to go to a play. Well, you have
no idea what the playhouses were, or what the green boxes were, when
Garrick and Mrs. Pritchard were playing before them! And I, for my
children's sake, thank that good Actor in his (<font color='blue'><b>Actor</b></font>) retirement who was
the first to banish that shame from the theatre. No, madam, you are
mistaken; I do not plume myself on my superior virtue. I do not say you
are naturally better than your ancestress in her (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>) wild, rouged, gambling,
flaring tearing days; or even than poor Polly Fogle, who is just taken
up for shoplifting, and would have been hung for it a hundred years ago.
Only, I am heartily thankful that my temptations are less, having quite
enough to do with those of the present century.

<p/>So, if Harry Warrington rides down to Newmarket to the October meeting,
and loses or wins his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) money there; if he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) makes one of a party at the
Shakspeare or Bedford Head; if he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) dines at White's ordinary, and sits
down to macco and lansquenet afterwards; if he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) boxes the watch, and
makes his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) appearance at the Roundhouse; if he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) turns out for a short
space a wild dissipated, harum-scarum young Harry Warrington; I, knowing
the weakness of human nature, am not going to be surprised; and, quite
aware of my own shortcomings, don't intend to be very savage at my
neighbour's. Mr. Sampson was: in his (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) chapel in Long Acre he (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) whipped Vice
tremendously; gave Sin no quarter; out-cursed Blasphemy with superior
Anathemas; knocked Drunkenness down, and trampled on the prostrate brute
wallowing in the gutter; dragged out conjugal Infidelity, and pounded
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) with endless stones of rhetoric--and, after service, came to dinner
at the Star and Garter, made a bowl of punch for Harry and his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) friends
at the Bedford Head, or took a hand at whist at Mr. Warrington's
lodgings or my Lord March's, or wherever there was a supper and good
company for him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>).

<p/>I often think, however, in respect of Mr. Warrington's doings at this
period of his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) coming to London, that I may have taken my usual degrading
and uncharitable views of him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>)--for, you see, I have not uttered a single
word of virtuous indignation against his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) conduct, and if it was not
reprehensible, have certainly judged him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) most cruelly. O the Truthful,
O the Beautiful, O Modesty, O Benevolence, O Pudor, O Mores, O Blushing
Shame, O Namby Pamby--each with your respective capital letters to your
honoured names! O Niminy, O Piminy! how shall I dare for to go for to
say that a young man ever was a young man?

<p/>No doubt, dear young lady, I am calumniating Mr. Warrington according to
my heartless custom. As a proof here is a letter out of the Warrington
collection, from Harry to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) mother in which there is not a single word
that would lead you to suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was leading a wild life. And such a
letter from an only son to a fond and exemplary parent, we know must be
true:--


<p/>``BOND STREET, LONDON, October 25, 1756.

<p/>``HONORD MADAM--I take up my pen to acknowledge your honored favor of 10
July per Lively Virginia packet, which has duly come to hand, forwarded
by our Bristol agent, and rejoice to hear that the prospect of the crops
is so good. `Tis Tully who says that agriculture is the noblest pursuit;
how delightful when that pursuit is also prophetable!

<p/>``Since my last, dated from Tunbridge Wells, one or two insadence have
occurred of which it is nessasery -LSB-This word has been much operated
upon with the penknife, but is left sic, no doubt to the writer's
satisfaction.-RSB- I should advise my honored Mother. Our party there broke
up end of August: the partridge-shooting commencing. Baroness Bernstein,
whose kindness to me has been most invariable, has been to Bath, her (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>)
usual winter resort, and has made me a welcome present of a fifty-pound
bill. I rode back with Rev. Mr. Sampson, whose instruction I find
most valluble, and my cousin, Lady Maria, to Castlewood. -LSB-Could Parson
Sampson have been dictating the above remarks to Mr. Warrington?-RSB- I paid
a flying visit on the way to my dear kind friends Col. and Mrs. Lambert,
Oakhurst House, who send my honored mother their most affectionate
remembrances. The youngest Miss Lambert, I grieve to say, was dellicate;
and her (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) parents in some anxiety.

<p/>``At Castlewood I lament to state my stay was short, owing to a quarrel
with my cousin William. He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) is a young man of violent passions, and alas!
addicted to liquor, when he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) has no controul over them. In a triffling
dispute about a horse, high words arose between us, and he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) aymed a blow
at me or its equivulent--which my Grandfathers my honored mothers child
could not brook. I rejoyned, and feld him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) to the ground, whents he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) was
carried almost sencelis to bed. I sent to enquire after his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) health in
the morning: but having no further news of him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>), came away to London
where I have been ever since with brief intavles of absence.

<p/>``Knowing you would wish me to see my dear Grandfathers University of
Cambridge, I rode thither lately in company with some friends, passing
through part of Harts, and lying at the famous bed of Ware. The October
meeting was just begun at Cambridge when I went. I saw the students in
their gownds and capps, and rode over to the famous Newmarket Heath,
where there happened to be some races--my friend Lord Marchs horse
Marrowbones by Cleaver coming off winner of a large steak. It was an
amusing day--the jockeys, horses, etc., very different to our poor races
at home--the betting awful--the richest noblemen here mix with the jox,
and bett all round. Cambridge pleased me: especially King's College
Chapel, of a rich but elegant Gothick.

<p/>``I have been out into the world, and am made member of the Club
at White's, where I meet gentlemen of the first fashion. My Lords
Rockingham, Carlisle, Orford, Bolingbroke, Coventry are of my friends,
introduced to me by my Lord March, of whom I have often wrote before.
Lady Coventry is a fine woman, but thinn. Every lady paints here, old
and young; so, if you and Mountain and Fanny wish to be in fashion,
I must send you out some roogepots: everybody plays--eight, ten,
card-tables at every house on every receiving-night. I am sorry to say
all do not play fair, and some do not pay fair. I have been obliged
to sit down, and do as Rome does, and have actually seen ladies whom I
could name take my counters from before my face!

<p/>``One day, his (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) regiment the 20th being paraded in St. James's Park, a
friend of mine, Mr. Wolfe, did me the honour to present me to his (<font color='blue'><b>Wolfe</b></font>)
Royal Highness the Captain-General, who was most gracious; a fat, jolly
Prince, if I may speak so without disrespect, reminding me in his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) manner
of that unhappy General Braddock; whom we knew to our sorrow last year.
When he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) heard my name, and how dearest George had served and fallen in
Braddock's unfortunate campaign, he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) talked a great deal with me; asked
why a young fellow like me did not serve too; why I did not go to the
King of Prussia, who was a great General, and see a campaign or two;
and whether that would not be better than dawdling about at routs and
card-parties in London? I said, I would like to go with all my heart,
but was an only son now, on leave from my mother, and belonged to our
estate in Virginia. His (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) Royal Highness said, Mr. Braddock had wrote home
accounts of Mrs. Esmond's loyalty, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Braddock</b></font>) would gladly serve me.
Mr. Wolfe and I have waited on him (<font color='blue'><b>Wolfe</b></font>) since, at his (<font color='blue'><b>Wolfe</b></font>) Royal Highness's house
in Pall Mall. The latter, who is still quite a young man, made the Scots
campaign with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) Highness, whom Mr. Dempster loves so much at home. To
be sure, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dempster</b></font>) was too severe: if anything can be top severe against rebels
in arms.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Draper has had half the Stock, my late Papa's property, transferred
to my name. Until there can be no doubt of that painful loss in our
family which I would give my right hand to replace, the remaining stock
must remain in the trustees' name in behalf of him (<font color='blue'><b>Draper</b></font>) who inherited it.
Ah, dear mother! There is no day, scarce any hour, when I don't think of
him (<font color='blue'><b>Draper</b></font>). I wish he (<font color='blue'><b>Draper</b></font>) were by me often. I feel like as if I was better when I
am thinking of him (<font color='blue'><b>Draper</b></font>), and would like, for the honour of my family, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Draper</b></font>)
was representing of it here instead of--Honored madam, your dutiful and

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``P.S.--I am like your sex, who always, they say, put their chief news in

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``CLARGIS STREET, LONDON, October 23, 1756.

<p/>``I think, my good sister, we have been all our lives a little more than
kin and less than kind, to use the words of a poet whom your dear father
loved dearly. When you were born in our Western Principallitie, my
mother was not as old as Isaac's; but even then I was much more than old
enough to be yours. And though she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) gave you all she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) could leave or give,
including the little portion of love that ought to have been my share,
yet, if we can have good will for one another, we may learn to do
without affection: and some little kindness you owe me, for your son's
sake; as well as your father's, whom I loved and admired more than any
man I think ever I knew in this world: he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was greater than almost all,
though he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) made no noyse in it. I have seen very many who have, and,
believe me, have found but few with such good heads and good harts as
Mr. Esmond.

<p/>``Had we been better acquainted, I might have given you some advice
regarding your young gentleman's introduction to Europe, which you would
have taken or not, as people do in this world. At least you would have
sed afterwards, `What she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) counselled me was right, and had Harry done as
Madam Beatrix wisht, it had been better for him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>).' My good sister, it was
not for you to know, or for me to whom you never wrote to tell you,
but your boy in coming to England and Castlewood found but ill friends
there; except one, an old aunt, of whom all kind of evil hath been
spoken and sed these fifty years past--and not without cawse too,
perhaps.

<p/>``Now, I must tell Harry's mother what will doubtless scarce astonish
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), that almost everybody who knows him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) loves him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) is prudent of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) tongue, generous of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) money, as bold as a lyon, with an imperious
domineering way that sets well upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>); you know whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) is handsome
or not: my dear, I like him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) none the less for not being over witty or
wise, and never cared for your sett-the-Thames afire gentlemen, who are
so much more clever than their neighbours. Your father's great friend,
Mr. Addison, seemed to me but a supercillious prig, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Addison</b></font>) follower,
Sir Dick Steele, was not pleasant in his (<font color='blue'><b>Addison</b></font>) cupps, nor out of `em. And
-LRB-revenons a luy-RRB- your Master Harry will certainly, pot burn the river
up with his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wits. Of book-learning he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) is as ignorant as any lord in
England, and for this I hold him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) none the worse. If Heaven have not
given him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) a turn that way, `tis of no use trying to bend him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>).

<p/>``Considering the place he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) is to hold in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) own colony when he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) returns,
and the stock he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) comes from, let me tell you, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hath not means
enough allowed him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) to support his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) station, and is likely to make the
more depence from the narrowness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) income--from sheer despair
breaking out of all bounds, and becoming extravagant, which is not his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
turn. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) likes to live as well as the rest of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) company, and,
between ourselves, has fell into some of the finist and most rakish in
England. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) thinks `tis for the honour of the family not to go back, and
many a time calls for ortolans and champaign when he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) would as leaf dine
with a stake and a mugg of beer. And in this kind of spirit I have no
doubt from what he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hath told me in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) talk -LRB-which is very naif, as the
French say-RRB-, that his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) mamma hath encouraged him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) high opinion of
himself. We women like our belongings to have it, however little we love
to pay the cost. Will you have your ladd make a figar in London? Trebble
his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) allowance at the very least, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) Aunt Bernstein -LRB-with his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
honored mamma's permission-RRB- will add a little more on to whatever summ
you give him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). Otherwise he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) will be spending the little capital I learn
he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) has in this country, which, when a ladd once begins to manger, there
is very soon an end to the loaf. Please God, I shall be able to leave
Henry Esmond's grandson something at my death; but my savings are small,
and the pension with which my gracious Sovereign hath endowed me dies
with me. As for feu M. de Bernstein, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>) left only debt at his (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>) decease:
the officers of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>) Majesty's Electoral Court of Hannover are but
scantily paid.

<p/>``A lady who is at present very high in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>) Majesty's confidence hath
taken a great phancy to your ladd, and will take an early occasion to
bring him (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>) to the Sovereign's favorable notice. His (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>) Royal Highness the
Duke he (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>) hath seen. If live in America he (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>) must, why should not Mr. Esmond
Warrington return as Governor of Virginia, and with a title to his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) name?
That is what I hope for him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>).

<p/>``Meanwhile, I must be candid with you, and tell you I fear he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) hath
entangled himself here in a very silly engagement. Even to marry an
old woman for money is scarce pardonable--the game ne valant gueres la
chandelle--Mr. Bernstein, when alive, more than once assured me of this
fact, and I believe him (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>), poor gentleman! to engage yourself to an old
woman without money, and to marry her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) merely because you have promised
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), this seems to me a follie which only very young lads fall into,
and I fear Mr. Warrington is one. How, or for what consideration, I know
not, but my niece Maria Esmond hath escamote a promise from Harry. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
knows nothing of her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) antecedens, which I do. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) hath laid herself out
for twenty husbands these twenty years past. I care not how she (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) hath
got the promise from him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). `Tis a sin and a shame that a woman more than
forty years old should surprize the honour of a child like that, and
hold him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) word. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is not the woman she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) pretends to be. A horse
jockey -LRB-he (<font color='blue'><b>jockey</b></font>) saith-RRB- cannot take him (<font color='blue'><b>jockey</b></font>) in--but a woman!

<p/>``I write this news to you advisedly, displeasant as it must be. Perhaps
`twill bring you to England: but I would be very cautious, above all,
very gentle, for the bitt will instantly make his (<font color='blue'><b>jockey</b></font>) high spirit restive.
I fear the property is entailed, so that threats of cutting him (<font color='blue'><b>jockey</b></font>) off from
it will not move Maria. Otherwise I know her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) to be so mercenary that
-LRB-though she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) really hath a great phancy for this handsome ladd-RRB- without
money she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) would not hear of him (<font color='blue'><b>jockey</b></font>). All I could, and more than I ought, I
have done to prevent the match. What and more I will not say in writing;
but that I am, for Henry Esmond's sake, his (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) grandson's sincerest friend,
and madam,--Your faithful sister and servant, BEATRIX BARONESS DE
BERNSTEIN.

 (<font color='red'><b>Madam Esmond/Madam Esmond Warrington/Madam Warrington</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER XLII. Fortunatus Nimium


<p/>Though Harry Warrington persisted in his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) determination to keep that
dismal promise which his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) cousin had extracted from him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>), we trust no
benevolent reader will think so ill of him (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) as to suppose that the
engagement was to the young fellow's taste, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) would not be
heartily glad to be rid of it. Very likely the beating administered to
poor Will was to this end; and Harry may have thought, <div class="bookquote">``A boxing-match
between us is sure to bring on a quarrel with the family; in the quarrel
with the family, Maria may take her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) brother's side. I, of course,
will make no retraction or apology. Will, in that case, may call me to
account, when I know which is the better man. In the midst of the feud,
the agreement may come to an end, and I may be a free man once more.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div><p/>So honest Harry laid his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) train, and fired it: but, the explosion over,
no harm was found to be done, except that William Esmond's nose was
swollen, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) eye black for a week. He (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) did not send a challenge to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) cousin, Harry Warrington; and, in consequence, neither killed Harry,
nor was killed by him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). Will was knocked down, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) got up again. How
many men of sense would do the same, could they get their little account
settled in a private place, with nobody to tell how the score was paid!
Maria by no means took her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) family's side in the quarrel, but declared
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) cousin, as did my lord, when advised of the disturbance. Will
had struck the first blow, Lord Castlewood said, by the chaplain's
showing. It was not the first or the tenth time he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) had been found
quarrelling in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) cups. Mr. Warrington only showed a proper spirit in
resenting the injury, and it was for Will, not for Harry, to ask pardon.

<p/>Harry said he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) would accept no apology as long as his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) horse was not
returned or his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) bet paid. The chronicler has not been able to find out,
from any of the papers which have come under his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) view, how that affair
of the bet was finally arranged; but `tis certain the cousins presently
met in the houses of various friends, and without mauling each other.

<p/>Maria's elder brother had been at first quite willing that his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) sister,
who had remained unmarried for so many years, and on the train of whose
robe, in her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) long course over the path of life, so many briars, so much
mud, so many rents and stains had naturally gathered, should marry
with any bridegroom who presented himself, and if with a gentleman from
Virginia, so much the better. She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) would retire to his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) wigwam in the
forest, and there be disposed of. In the natural course of things, Harry
would survive his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) elderly bride, and might console himself or not, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
preferred, after her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) departure.

<p/>But, after an interview with Aunt Bernstein, which his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) lordship had on
his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) coming to London, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) changed his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) opinion: and even went so far as
to try and dissuade Maria from the match; and to profess a pity for the
young fellow who was made to undergo a life of misery on account of a
silly promise given at one-and-twenty!

<p/>Misery, indeed! Maria was at a loss to know why he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) was to be miserable.
Pity, forsooth! My lord at Castlewood had thought it was no pity at all.
Maria knew what pity meant. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) brother had been with Aunt Bernstein:
Aunt Bernstein had offered money to break this match off. She (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) understood
what my lord meant, but Mr. Warrington was a man of honour, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>)
could trust him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>). Away, upon this, walks my lord to White's, or to
whatever haunts he (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>) frequented. It is probable that his (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>) sister had
guessed too accurately what the nature of his (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>) conversation wit Madame
Bernstein had been.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And so,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>thinks he (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``the end of my virtue is likely to be that the
Mohock will fall a prey to others, and that there is no earthly use in
my sparing him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). `Quem deus vult'--what was that schoolmaster's adage? If
I don't have him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), somebody else will, that is clear. My brother has had
a slice; my dear sister wants to swallow the whole of him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) bodily.
Here have I been at home respecting his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) youth and innocence forsooth,
declining to play beyond the value of a sixpence, and acting guardian
and Mentor to him (<font color='blue'><b>Mentor</b></font>). Why, I am but a fool to fatten a goose for other
people to feed off! Not many a good action have I done in this life,
and here is this one, that serves to benefit whom?--other folks. Talk of
remorse! By all the fires and furies, the remorse I have is for things I
haven't done and might have done! Why did I spare Lucretia? She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucretia</b></font>) hated me
ever after, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucretia</b></font>) husband went the way for which he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was predestined.
Why have I let this lad off?--that March and the rest, who don't want
him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), may pluck him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)! And I have a bad repute; and I am the man people
point at, and call the wicked lord, and against whom women warn their
sons! Pardi, I am not a penny worse, only a great deal more unlucky
than my neighbours, and `tis only my cursed weakness that has been my
greatest enemy!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Here, manifestly, in setting down a speech which a
gentleman only thought, a chronicler overdraws his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) account with
the patient reader, who has a right not to accept this draft on his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
credulity. But have not Livy, and Thucydides, and a score more of
historians, made speeches for their heroes, which we know the latter
never thought of delivering? How much more may we then, knowing my Lord
Castlewood's character so intimately as we do, declare what was passing
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) mind, and transcribe his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) thoughts on this paper? What? a whole
pack of the wolves are on the hunt after this lamb, and will make a meal
of him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) presently, and one hungry old hunter is to stand by, and not have
a single cutlet? Who has not admired that noble speech of my Lord Clive,
when reproached on his (<font color='blue'><b>Clive</b></font>) return from India with making rather too free
with jaghires, lakhs, gold mohurs, diamonds, pearls, and what not? <div class="bookquote">``Upon
my life,''  (<font color='red'><b>the hero</b></font>)</div>said the hero of Plassy, <div class="bookquote">``when I think of my opportunities, I
am surprised I took so little!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the hero</b></font>)</div><p/>To tell disagreeable stories of a gentleman, until one is in a manner
forced to impart them, is always painful to a feeling mind. Hence,
though I have known, before the very first page of this history was
written, what sort of a person my Lord Castlewood was, and in what
esteem he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) was held by his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) contemporaries, I have kept back much that was
unpleasant about him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>), only allowing the candid reader to perceive that
he (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) was a nobleman who ought not to be at all of our liking. It is true
that my Lord March, and other gentlemen of whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) complained, would
have thought no more of betting with Mr. Warrington for his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) last
shilling, and taking their winnings, than they would scruple to pick the
bones of a chicken; that they would take any advantage of the game, or
their superior skill in it, of the race, and their private knowledge
of the horses engaged; in so far, they followed the practice of all
gentlemen: but when they played, they played fair; and when they lost,
they paid.

<p/>Now Madame Bernstein was loth to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) Virginian nephew all she (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) knew
to his (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>) family's discredit; she (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) was even touched by my lord's forbearance
in regard to Harry on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) first arrival in Europe; and pleased with his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
lordship's compliance with her (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) wishes in this particular. But in the
conversation which she (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) had with her (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) nephew Castlewood regarding Maria's
designs on Harry, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had spoken his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) mind out with his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) usual cynicism,
voted himself a fool for having spared a lad whom no sparing would
eventually keep from ruin; pointed out Mr. Harry's undeniable
extravagances and spendthrift associates, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) nights at faro and hazard,
and his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) rides to Newmarket, and asked why he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) alone should keep his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hands
from the young fellow? In vain Madame Bernstein pleaded that Harry was
poor. Bah! he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was heir to a principality which ought to have been his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>),
Castlewood's, and might have set up their ruined family. -LRB-Indeed Madame
Bernstein thought Mr. Warrington's Virginian property much greater than
it was.-RRB- Were there not money-lenders in the town who would give him (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>)
money on postobits in plenty? Castlewood knew as much to his (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>) cost: he (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>)
had applied to them in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>) father's lifetime, and the cursed crew
had eaten up two-thirds of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>) miserable income. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>) spoke with such
desperate candour and ill-humour, that Madame Bernstein began to be
alarmed for her (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>) favourite, and determined to caution him (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>) at the first
opportunity.

<p/>That evening she (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>) began to pen a billet to Mr. Warrington: but all her (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>)
life long she (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>) was slow with her (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>) pen, and disliked using it. <div class="bookquote">``I never
knew any good come of writing more than bon jour or business,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>) used
to say. <div class="bookquote">``What is the use of writing ill, when there are so many clever
people who can do it well? and even then it were best left alone.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>So
she (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>) sent one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>) men to Mr. Harry's lodgings, bidding him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) come and
drink a dish of tea with her (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>) next day, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>) proposed to warn him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>).

<p/>But the next morning she (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>) was indisposed, and could not receive Mr. Harry
when he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) came: and she (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>) kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>) chamber for a couple of days, and the
next day there was a great engagement, and the next day Mr. Harry was
off on some expedition of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) own. In the whirl of London life, what man
sees his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) neighbour, what brother his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sister, what schoolfellow his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) old
friend? Ever so many days passed before Mr. Warrington and his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) aunt had
that confidential conversation which the latter desired.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) began by scolding him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) mildly about his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) extravagance and madcap
frolics -LRB-though, in truth, she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) was charmed with him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) for both-RRB---he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>)
replied that young men will be young men, and that it was in dutifully
waiting in attendance on his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) aunt, he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) had made the acquaintance with
whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) mostly lived at present. She (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) then with some prelude, began to
warn him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) regarding his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) cousin, Lord Castlewood; on which he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) broke into a
bitter laugh, and said the good-natured world had told him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) plenty about
Lord Castlewood already. <div class="bookquote">``To say of a man of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lordship's rank, or
of any gentleman, `Don't play with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>),' is more than I like to do,''
 (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>continued the lady; <div class="bookquote">``but...''

 (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, you may say on, aunt!''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>said Harry, with something like an
imprecation on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) lips.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And have you played with your cousin already?''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>asked the young man's
worldly old monitress.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And lost and won, madam!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>answers Harry, gallantly. <div class="bookquote">``It don't become me
to say which. If we have a bout with a neighbour in Virginia, a bottle,
or a pack of cards, or a quarrel, we don't go home and tell our mothers.
I mean no offence, aunt!''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>And, blushing, the handsome young fellow went
up and kissed the old lady. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) looked very brave and brilliant, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
rich lace, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) fair face and hair, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) fine new suit of velvet and gold.
On taking leave of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) aunt he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) gave his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) usual sumptuous benefaction to
her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) servants, who crowded round him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). It was a rainy wintry day, and my
gentleman, to save his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) fine silk stockings, must come in a chair. <div class="bookquote">``To
White's!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) called out to the chairmen, and away they carried him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) to
the place where he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) passed a great deal of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) time.

<p/>Our Virginian's friends might have wished that he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had been a less
sedulous frequenter of that house of entertainment; but so much may be
said in favour of Mr. Warrington that, having engaged in play, he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) fought
his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) battle like a hero. He (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) was not flustered by good luck, and perfectly
calm when the chances went against him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>). If Fortune is proverbially
fickle to men at play, how many men are fickle to Fortune, run away
frightened from her (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) advances; and desert her (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>), who, perhaps, had never
thought of leaving them but for their cowardice. <div class="bookquote">``By George, Mr.
Warrington,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Selwyn/Selwyn</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Selwyn, waking up in a rare fit of enthusiasm,
<div class="bookquote">``you deserve to win! You treat your luck as a gentleman should, and
as long as she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) remains with you, behave to her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) with the most perfect
politeness. Si celeres quatit pennas--you know the rest--no? Well, you
are not much the worse off--you will call her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) ladyship's coach, and make
her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) a bow at the step. Look at Lord Castlewood yonder, passing the box.
Did you ever hear a fellow curse and swear so at losing five or six
pieces? She (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) must be a jade indeed, if she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) long give her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) favours to such
a niggardly canaille as that!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Selwyn/Selwyn</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We don't consider our family canaille, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Warrington, <div class="bookquote">``and
my Lord Castlewood is one of them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I forgot. I forgot, and ask your pardon! And I make you my compliment
upon my lord, and Mr. Will Esmond, his (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) brother,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>says Harry's neighbour
at the hazard-table. <div class="bookquote">``The box is with me. Five's the main! Deuce Ace! my
usual luck. Virtute mea me involvo!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) sinks back in his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) chair.

<p/>Whether it was upon this occasion of taking the box, that Mr. Harry
threw the fifteen mains mentioned in one of those other letters of Mr.
Walpole's, which have not come into his (<font color='blue'><b>Walpole</b></font>) present learned editor's hands,
I know not; but certain it is, that on his (<font color='blue'><b>Walpole</b></font>) first appearance at White's,
Harry had five or six evenings of prodigious good luck, and seemed more
than ever the Fortunate Youth. The five hundred pounds withdrawn from
his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) patrimonial inheritance had multiplied into thousands. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) bought
fine clothes, purchased fine horses, gave grand entertainments, made
handsome presents, lived as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had been as rich as Sir James Lowther,
or his (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) Grace of Bedford, and yet the five thousand pounds never seemed
to diminish. No wonder that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) gave where giving was so easy; no wonder
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) was generous with Fortunatus's purse in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) pocket. I say no
wonder that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) gave, for such was his (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) nature. Other Fortunati tie up the
endless purse, drink small beer, and go to bed with a tallow candle.

<p/>During this vein of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) luck, what must Mr. Harry do, but find out from
Lady Maria what her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) ladyship's debts were, and pay them off to the
last shilling. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) stepmother and half-sister, who did not love her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
treated to all sorts of magnificent presents. <div class="bookquote">``Had you not better get
yourself arrested, Will?''  (<font color='red'><b>lord</b></font>)</div>my lord sardonically said to his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) brother.
<div class="bookquote">``Although you bit him (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) in that affair of the horse, the Mohock will
certainly take you out of pawn.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. William/William/William Esmond</b></font>)</div>It was then that Mr. William felt a
true remorse, although not of that humble kind which sent the repentant
Prodigal to his (<font color='blue'><b>Prodigal</b></font>) knees. <div class="bookquote">``Confound it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Prodigal</b></font>) groaned, <div class="bookquote">``to think that I have
let this fellow slip for such a little matter as forty pound! Why, he (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>)
was good for a thousand at least.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>As for Maria, that generous creature accepted the good fortune sent
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) with a grateful heart; and was ready to accept as much more as you
pleased. Having paid off her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) debts to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) various milliners, tradesmen,
and purveyors, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) forthwith proceeded to contract new ones. Mrs. Betty,
her (<font color='blue'><b>Betty</b></font>) ladyship's maid, went round informing the tradespeople that her (<font color='blue'><b>Betty</b></font>)
mistress was about to contract a matrimonial alliance with a young
gentleman of immense fortune; so that they might give my lady credit
to any amount. Having heard the same story twice or thrice before, the
tradesfolk might not give it entire credit, but their bills were paid:
even to Mrs. Pincott, of Kensington, my lady showed no rancour, and
affably ordered fresh supplies from her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>): and when she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) drove about from
the mercer to the toy-shop, and from the toy-shop to the jeweller in
a coach, with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) maid and Mr. Warrington inside, they thought her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) a
fortunate woman indeed, to have secured the Fortunate Youth, though they
might wonder at the taste of this latter in having selected so elderly a
beauty. Mr. Sparks, of Tavistock Street, Covent Garden, took the liberty
of waiting upon Mr. Warrington at his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) lodgings in Bond Street, with the
pearl necklace and the gold etwee which he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) had bought in Lady Maria's
company the day before; and asking whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>), Sparks, should leave them
at his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) honour's lodging, or send them to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) ladyship with his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) honour's
compliments? Harry added a ring out of the stock which the jeweller
happened to bring with him (<font color='blue'><b>jeweller</b></font>), to the necklace and the etwee; and
sumptuously bidding that individual to send him (<font color='blue'><b>jeweller</b></font>) in the bill, took a
majestic leave of Mr. Sparks, who retired, bowing even to Gumbo, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Sparks</b></font>)
quitted his (<font color='blue'><b>Sparks</b></font>) honour's presence.

<p/>Nor did his (<font color='blue'><b>Sparks</b></font>) bounties end here. Ere many days the pleased young fellow
drove up in his (<font color='blue'><b>Sparks</b></font>) phaeton to Mr. Sparks' shop, and took a couple of
trinkets for two young ladies, whose parents had been kind to him (<font color='blue'><b>Sparks</b></font>), and
for whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Sparks</b></font>) entertained a sincere regard. <div class="bookquote">``Ah!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Sparks</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``how I wish
I had my poor George's wit, and genius for poetry! I would send these
presents with pretty verses to Hetty and Theo. I am sure, if goodwill
and real regard could make a poet of me, I should have no difficulty in
finding rhymes.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And so he (<font color='blue'><b>Sparks</b></font>) called in Parson Sampson, and they concocted
a billet together.




<p/>CHAPTER XLIII. In which Harry flies High


<p/>So Mr. Harry Warrington, of Virginia, had his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) lodgings in Bond Street,
London, England, and lived upon the fat of the land, and drank bumpers
of the best wine thereof. His (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) title of Fortunate Youth was pretty
generally recognised. Being young, wealthy, good-looking, and fortunate,
the fashionable world took him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) by the hand and made him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) welcome.
And don't, my dear brethren, let us cry out too loudly against the
selfishness of the world for being kind to the young, handsome, and
fortunate, and frowning upon you and me, who may be, for argument's
sake, old, ugly, and the miserablest dogs under the sun. If I have a
right to choose my acquaintance, and--at the club, let us say prefer the
company of a lively, handsome, well-dressed, gentleman like young
man, who amuses me, to that of a slouching, ill-washed, misanthropic
H-murderer, a ceaselessly prating coxcomb, or what not; has not
society--the aggregate you and I--a right to the same choice? Harry was
liked because he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was likeable; because he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was rich, handsome, jovial,
well-born, well-bred, brave; because, with jolly topers, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) liked a
jolly song and a bottle; because, with gentlemen sportsmen, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) loved
any game that was a-foot or a-horseback; because, with ladies, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had a
modest blushing timidity which rendered the lad interesting; because,
to those humbler than himself in degree he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was always magnificently
liberal, and anxious to spare annoyance. Our Virginian was very
grand, and high and mighty, to be sure; but, in those times, when the
distinction of ranks yet obtained, to be high and distant with his (<font color='blue'><b>Virginian</b></font>)
inferiors, brought no unpopularity to a gentleman. Remember that, in
those days, the Secretary of State always knelt when he (<font color='blue'><b>Secretary</b></font>) went to the king
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Secretary</b></font>) despatches of a morning, and the Under-Secretary never dared to
sit down in his (<font color='blue'><b>Secretary</b></font>) chief's presence. If I were Secretary of State -LRB-and such
there have been amongst men of letters since Addison's days-RRB- I should
not like to kneel when I went in to my audience with my despatch-bog. If
I were Under-Secretary, I should not like to have to stand, whilst the
Right Honourable Benjamin or the Right Honourable Sir Edward looked over
the papers. But there is a modus in rebus: there are certain lines
which must be drawn: and I am only half pleased for my part, when Bob
Bowstreet, whose connection with letters is through Policeman X and
Y, and Tom Garbage, who is an esteemed contributor to the Kennel
Miscellany, propose to join fellowship as brother literary men, slap me
on the back, and call me old boy, or by my Christian name.

<p/>As much pleasure as the town could give in the winter season of 1756-57,
Mr. Warrington had for the asking. There were operas for him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>), in which
he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) took but moderate delight. -LRB-A prodigious deal of satire was brought
to bear against these Italian Operas, and they were assailed for being
foolish, Popish, unmanly, unmeaning; but people went, nevertheless.-RRB-
There were the theatres, with Mr. Garrick and Mrs. Pritchard at one
house, and Mrs. Clive at another. There were masquerades and ridottos
frequented by all the fine society; there were their lordships' and
ladyships' own private drums and assemblies, which began and ended with
cards, and which Mr. Warrington did not like so well as White's, because
the play there was neither so high nor so fair as at the club-table.

<p/>One day his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) kinsman, Lord Castlewood, took him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) to court, and presented
Harry to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) Majesty, who was now come to town from Kensington. But that
gracious sovereign either did not like Harry's introducer, or had other
reasons for being sulky. His (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) Majesty only said, <div class="bookquote">``Oh, heard of you from
Lady Yarmouth. The Earl of Castlewood''  (<font color='red'><b>Majesty</b></font>)</div>-LRB-turning to his (<font color='blue'><b>Majesty</b></font>) lordship, and
speaking in German-RRB- <div class="bookquote">``shall tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Earl</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Earl</b></font>) plays too much!''  (<font color='red'><b>lordship</b></font>)</div>And so
saying, the Defender of the Faith turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Defender</b></font>) royal back.

<p/>Lord Castlewood shrank back quite frightened at this cold reception of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Defender</b></font>) august master.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What does he (<font color='blue'><b>Earl</b></font>) say?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>asked Harry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``His (<font color='blue'><b>Earl</b></font>) Majesty thinks they play too high at White's, and is displeased,''
 (<font color='red'><b>the nobleman</b></font>)</div>whispered the nobleman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If he (<font color='blue'><b>Majesty</b></font>) does not want us, we had better not come again, that is all,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>said Harry, simply. <div class="bookquote">``I never, somehow, considered that German fellow a
real King of England.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hush! for Heaven's sake, hold your confounded colonial tongue!''  (<font color='red'><b>lord</b></font>)</div>cries
out my lord. <div class="bookquote">``Don't you see the walls here have ears!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And what then?''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>asks Mr. Warrington. <div class="bookquote">``Why, look at the people! Hang me,
if it is not quite a curiosity! They were all shaking hands with me, and
bowing to me, and flattering me just now; and at present they avoid me
as if I were the plague!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Shake hands, nephew,''  (<font color='red'><b>a gentleman</b></font>)</div>said a broad-faced, broad-shouldered gentleman,
in a scarlet-laced waistcoat, and a great old-fashioned wig. <div class="bookquote">``I heard
what you said. I have ears like the wall, look you. And, now, if other
people show you the cold shoulder, I'll give you my hand;''  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>and so
saying, the gentleman put out a great brown hand, with which he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) grasped
Harry's. <div class="bookquote">``Something of my brother about your eyes and face. Though I
suppose in your island you grow more wiry and thin like. I am thine
uncle, child. My name is Sir Miles Warrington. My lord knows me well
enough.''

 (<font color='red'><b>lord</b></font>)</div><p/>My lord looked very frightened and yellow. <div class="bookquote">``Yes, my dear Harry. This is
your paternal uncle, Sir Miles Warrington.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Might as well have come to see us in Norfolk, as dangle about playing
the fool at Tunbridge Wells, Mr. Warrington, or Mr. Esmond,--which do
you call yourself?''  (<font color='red'><b>the Baronet</b></font>)</div>said the Baronet. <div class="bookquote">``The old lady calls herself Madam
Esmond, don't she (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My mother is not ashamed of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) father's name, nor am I, uncle,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Harry/Mr. Harry Warrington</b></font>)</div>said
Mr. Harry, rather proudly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well said, lad! Come home and eat a bit of mutton with Lady Warrington,
at three, in Hill Street,--that is if you can do without your White's
kickshaws. You need not look frightened, my Lord Castlewood! I shall
tell no tales out of school.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I--I am sure Sir Miles Warrington will act as a gentleman!''  (<font color='red'><b>lord</b></font>)</div>says my
lord, in much perturbation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Belike, he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) will,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Baronet</b></font>)</div>growled the Baronet, turning on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) heel. <div class="bookquote">``And thou
wilt come, young man, at three; and mind, good roast mutton waits for
nobody. Thou hast a great look of thy father. Lord bless us, how we used
to beat each other! He (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) was smaller than me, and in course younger; but
many a time he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) had the best of it. Take it he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) was henpecked when he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>)
married, and Madam Esmond took the spirit out of him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) when she (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) got him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) island. Virginia is an island. Ain't it an island?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry laughed, and said <div class="bookquote">``No!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>And the jolly Baronet, going off, said,
<div class="bookquote">``Well, island or not, thou must come and tell all about it to my lady.
She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)'ll know whether `tis an island or not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Baronet</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear Mr. Warrington,''  (<font color='red'><b>lord</b></font>)</div>said my lord, with an appealing look, <div class="bookquote">``I need
not tell you that, in this great city, every man has enemies, and that
there is a great, great deal of detraction and scandal. I never spoke
to you about Sir Miles Warrington, precisely because I did know him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>),
and because we have had differences together. Should he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) permit himself
remarks to my disparagement, you will receive them cum grano, and
remember that it is from an enemy they come.''  (<font color='red'><b>lord</b></font>)</div>And the pair walked out
of the King's apartments and into Saint James's Street. Harry found the
news of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) cold reception at court had already preceded him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) to White's.
The King had turned his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) back upon him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>). The King was jealous of Harry's
favour with the favourite. Harry was au mieux with Lady Yarmouth. A
score of gentlemen wished him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) a compliment upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) conquest. Before
night it was a settled matter that this was amongst the other victories
of the Fortunate Youth.

<p/>Sir Miles told his (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) wife and Harry as much, when the young man appeared
at the appointed hour at the Baronet's dinner-table, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) rallied
Harry in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) simple rustic fashion. The lady, at first a grand and
stately personage, told Harry, on their further acquaintance, that the
reputation which the world had made for him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was so bad, that at first
she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had given him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) but a frigid welcome. With the young ladies, Sir
Miles's daughters, it was <div class="bookquote">``How d’ye do, cousin?''  (<font color='red'><b>Miles daughters</b></font>)</div>and <div class="bookquote">``No, thank you,
cousin,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Virginian</b></font>)</div>and a number of prim curtseys to the Virginian, as they greeted
him (<font color='blue'><b>Virginian</b></font>) and took leave of him (<font color='blue'><b>Virginian</b></font>). The little boy, the heir of the house, dined
at table, under the care of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) governor; and, having his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) glass of port
by papa after dinner, gave a loose to his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) innocent tongue, and asked
many questions of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) cousin. At last the innocent youth said, after
looking hard in Harry's face, <div class="bookquote">``Are you wicked, cousin Harry? You don't
look very wicked!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear Master Miles!''  (<font color='red'><b>the tutor</b></font>)</div>expostulates the tutor, turning very red.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But you know you said he (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) was wicked!''  (<font color='red'><b>the child</b></font>)</div>cried the child.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We are all miserable sinners, Miley,''  (<font color='red'><b>papa</b></font>)</div>explains papa. <div class="bookquote">``Haven't you heard
the clergyman say so every Sunday?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, but not so very wicked as cousin Harry. Is it true that you
gamble, cousin, and drink all night with wicked men, and frequent the
company of wicked women? You know you said so, Mr. Walker--and mamma
said so, too, that Lady Yarmouth was a wicked woman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you are a little pitcher,''  (<font color='red'><b>papa</b></font>)</div>cries papa: <div class="bookquote">``and my wife, nephew Harry,
is a staunch Jacobite--you won't like her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) the worse for that. Take Miles
to his (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) sisters, Mr. Walker, and Topsham shall give thee a ride in the
park, child, on thy little horse.''  (<font color='red'><b>papa</b></font>)</div>The idea of the little horse consoled
Master Miles; for, when his (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) father ordered him (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) away to his (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) sisters, he (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>)
had begun to cry bitterly, bawling out that he (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) would far rather stay
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) wicked cousin.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They have made you a sad reputation among `em, nephew!''  (<font color='red'><b>the Baronet</b></font>)</div>says the jolly
Baronet. <div class="bookquote">``My wife, you must know, of late years, and since the death of
my poor eldest son, has taken to,--to, hum!--to Tottenham Court Road and
Mr. Whitfield's preaching: and we have had one Ward about the house, a
friend of Mr. Walker's yonder, who has recounted sad stories about you
and your brother at home.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``About me, Sir Miles, as much as he (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) pleases,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>cries Harry, warm with
port: <div class="bookquote">``but I'll break any man's bones who dares say a word against my
brother! Why, sir, that fellow was not fit to buckle my dear George's
shoe; and if I find him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) repeating at home what he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) dared to say in our
house in Virginia, I promise him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) a second caning.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You seem to stand up for your friends, nephew Harry,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Baronet</b></font>)</div>says the Baronet.
<div class="bookquote">``Fill thy glass, lad, thou art not as bad as thou hast been painted.
I always told my lady so. I drink Madam Esmond Warrington's health, of
Virginia, and will have a full bumper for that toast.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry, as in duty bound, emptied his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) glass, filled again, and drank Lady
Warrington and Master Miles.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thou wouldst be heir to four thousand acres in Norfolk, did he (<font color='blue'><b>heir</b></font>) die,
though,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Baronet</b></font>)</div>said the Baronet.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``God forbid, sir, and be praised that I have acres enough in Virginia
of my own!''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Warrington. He (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) went up presently and took a dish of
coffee with Lady Warrington: he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) talked to the young ladies of the house.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) was quite easy, pleasant, and natural. There was one of them somewhat
like Fanny Mountain, and this young lady became his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) special favourite.
When he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) went away, they all agreed their wicked cousin was not near so
wicked as they had imagined him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) to be: at any rate, my lady had strong
hopes of rescuing him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) from the pit. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) sent him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) a good book that
evening, whilst Mr. Harry was at White's; with a pretty note, praying
that Law's Call might be of service to him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>): and, this despatched, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
and her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) daughters went off to a rout at the house of a minister's lady.
But Harry, before he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) went to White's, had driven to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) friend Mr.
Sparks, in Tavistock Street, and purchased more trinkets for his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) female
cousins--<div class="bookquote">``from their aunt in Virginia,''  (<font color='red'><b>cousins</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said. You see, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was full of
kindness: he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) kindled and warmed with prosperity. There are men on whom
wealth hath no such fortunate influence. It hardens base hearts: it
makes those who were mean and servile, mean and proud. If it should
please the gods to try me with ten thousand a year, I will, of course,
meekly submit myself to their decrees, but I will pray them to give me
strength enough to bear the trial. All the girls in Hill Street were
delighted at getting the presents from Aunt Warrington in Virginia and
addressed a collective note, which must have astonished that good lady
when she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) received it in spring-time, when she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) and Mountain and Fanny
were on a visit to grim deserted Castlewood, when the snows had cleared
away and a thousand peach-trees flushed with blossoms. <div class="bookquote">``Poor boy!''  (<font color='red'><b>the mother</b></font>)</div>the
mother thought <div class="bookquote">``This is some present he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) gave his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) cousins in my name,
in the time of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) prosperity--nay, of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) extravagance and folly. How
quickly his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) wealth has passed away! But he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) ever had a kind heart for the
poor Mountain; and we must not forget him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) need. It behoves us to
be more than ever careful of our own expenses, my good people!''  (<font color='red'><b>the mother</b></font>)</div>And so,
I dare say, they warmed themselves by one log, and ate of one dish, and
worked by one candle. And the widow's servants, whom the good soul began
to pinch more and more I fear, lied, stole, and cheated more and more:
and what was saved in one way, was stole in another.

<p/>One afternoon, Mr. Harry sate in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) Bond Street lodgings, arrayed in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) dressing-gown, sipping his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) chocolate, surrounded by luxury, encased
in satin, and yet enveloped in care. A few weeks previously when the
luck was with him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was scattering his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) benefactions to and fro,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had royally told Parson Sampson to get together a list of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) debts
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), Mr. Warrington, would pay. Accordingly Sampson had gone to
work, and had got together a list, not of all his (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) debts--no man ever
does set down all,--but such a catalogue as he (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) thought sufficient to
bring in to Mr. Warrington, at whose breakfast-table the divine had
humbly waited until his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) honour should choose to attend it.

<p/>Harry appeared at length, very pale and languid, in curl-papers, and
scarce any appetite for his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) breakfast; and the chaplain, fumbling with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) schedule in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) pocket, humbly asked if his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) patron had had a bad
night? He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had been brought home from White's by two chairmen at five
o’clock in the morning; had caught a confounded cold, for one of the
windows of the chair would not shut, and the rain and snow came in,
finally, was in such a bad humour, that all poor Sampson's quirks and
jokes could scarcely extort a smile from him (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>).

<p/>At last, to be sure, Mr. Warrington burst into a loud laugh. It was when
the poor chaplain, after a sufficient discussion of muffins, eggs, tea,
the news, the theatres, and so forth, pulled a paper out of his (<font color='blue'><b>chaplain</b></font>) pocket
and in a piteous tone said, <div class="bookquote">``Here is that schedule of debts which your
honour asked for--two hundred and forty-three pounds--every shilling I
owe in the world, thank Heaven!--that is--ahem!--every shilling of which
the payment will in the least inconvenience me--and I need not tell my
dearest patron that I shall consider him (<font color='blue'><b>patron</b></font>) my saviour and benefactor!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the chaplain</b></font>)</div><p/>It was then that Harry, taking the paper and eyeing the chaplain with
rather a wicked look, burst into a laugh, which was, however, anything
but jovial. Wicked execrations, moreover, accompanied this outbreak of
humour, and the luckless chaplain felt that his (<font color='blue'><b>chaplain</b></font>) petition had come at the
wrong moment.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Confound it, why didn't you bring it on Monday?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>Harry asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Confound me, why did I not bring it on Monday?''  (<font color='red'><b>the chaplain</b></font>)</div>echoed the chaplain's
timid soul. <div class="bookquote">``It is my luck--my usual luck. Have the cards been against
you, Mr. Warrington?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes: a plague on them. Monday night, and last night, have both gone
against me. Don't be frightened, chaplain, there's money enough in the
locker yet. But I must go into the City and get some.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What, sell out, sir?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>asks his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) reverence, with a voice that was
reassured, though it intended to be alarmed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sell out, sir? Yes! I borrowed a hundred off Mackreth in counters last
night, and must pay him (<font color='blue'><b>chaplain</b></font>) at dinner-time. I will do your business for you
nevertheless, and never fear, my good Mr. Sampson. Come to breakfast
to-morrow, and we will see and deliver your reverence from the
Philistines.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>But though he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) laughed in Sampson's presence, and strove
to put a good face upon the matter, Harry's head sank down on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) chest
when the parson quitted him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) sate over the fire, beating the
coals about with the poker, and giving utterance to many disjointed
naughty words, which showed, but did not relieve, the agitation of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
spirit.

<p/>In this mood, the young fellow was interrupted by the appearance of a
friend, who, on any other day--even on that one when his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) conscience was
so uneasy--was welcome to Mr. Warrington. This was no other than Mr.
Lambert, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) military dress, but with a cloak over him (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>), who had come
from the country, had been to the Captain-General's levee that morning,
and had come thence to visit his (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) young friend in Bond Street.

<p/>Harry may have thought Lambert's greeting rather cold; but being
occupied with his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) own affairs, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) put away the notion. How were the
ladies of Oakhurst, and Miss Hetty, who was ailing when he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) passed
through in the autumn? Purely? Mr. Warrington was very glad. They were
come to stay a while in London with their friend, Lord Wrotham? Mr.
Harry was delighted--though it must be confessed his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) face did not
exhibit any peculiar signs of pleasure when he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) heard the news.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And so you live at White's, and with the great folks; and you fare
sumptuously every day, and you pay your court at St. James's, and make
one at my Lady Yarmouth's routs, and at all the card-parties in the
Court end of the town?''  (<font color='red'><b>the Colonel</b></font>)</div>asks the Colonel.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear Colonel, I do what other folks do,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>says Harry, with rather a
high manner.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Other folks are richer folks than some folks, my dear lad.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sir!''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Warrington, <div class="bookquote">``I would thank you to believe that I owe
nothing for which I cannot pay!''

 (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should never have spoken about your affairs,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the other, not
noticing the young man's haughty tone, <div class="bookquote">``but that you yourself confided
them to me. I hear all sorts of stories about the Fortunate Youth. Only
at his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) Royal Highness's even today, they were saying how rich you were
already, and I did not undeceive them--''

 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Colonel Lambert, I cannot help the world gossiping about me!''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>cries Mr.
Warrington, more and more impatient.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``--And what prodigious sums you had won. Eighteen hundred one night--two
thousand another--six or eight thousand in all! Oh! there were gentlemen
from White's at the levee too, I can assure you, and the army can fling
a main as well as you civilians!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish they would meddle with their own affairs,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>says Harry, scowling
at his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) old friend.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And I, too, you look as if you were going to say. Well, my boy, it is
my affair and you must let Theo's father and Hetty's father, and Harry
Warrington's father's old friend say how it is my affair.''  (<font color='red'><b>the Colonel</b></font>)</div>Here the
Colonel drew a packet out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) pocket, whereof the lappets and the
coat-tails and the general pocket accommodations were much more ample
than in the scant military garments of present warriors. <div class="bookquote">``Look you,
Harry. These trinkets which you sent with the kindest heart in the world
to people who love you, and would cut off their little hands to spare
you needless pain, could never be bought by a young fellow with two or
three hundred a year. Why, a nobleman might buy these things, or a rich
City banker, and send them to his (<font color='blue'><b>banker</b></font>)--to his (<font color='blue'><b>banker</b></font>) daughters, let us say.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sir, as you say, I meant only kindness,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>says Harry, blushing
burning-red.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But you must not give them to my girls, my boy. Hester and Theodosia
Lambert must not be dressed up with the winnings off the gaming-table,
saving your presence. It goes to my heart to bring back the trinkets.
Mrs. Lambert will keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) present, which is of small value, and sends
you her (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) love and a God bless you--and so say I, Harry Warrington, with
all my heart.''  (<font color='red'><b>the Colonel</b></font>)</div>Here the good Colonel's voice was much moved, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
face grew very red, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) passed his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hand over his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) eyes ere he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) held it
out.

<p/>But the spirit of rebellion was strong in Mr. Warrington. He (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) rose up
from his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) seat, never offering to take the hand which his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) senior held out
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Give me leave to tell Colonel Lambert,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``that I have
had somewhat too much advice from him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>). You are for ever volunteering it,
sir, and when I don't ask it. You make it your business to inquire about
my gains at play, and about the company I keep. What right have you to
control my amusements or my companions? I strive to show my sense
of your former kindness by little presents to your family, and you
fling--you bring them back.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't do otherwise, Mr. Warrington,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Colonel</b></font>)</div>says the Colonel, with a very
sad face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Such a slight may mean nothing here, sir, but in our country it means
war, sir!''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>cries Mr. Warrington. <div class="bookquote">``God forbid I should talk of drawing a
sword against the father of ladies who have been as mother and sister
to me: but you have wounded my heart, Colonel Lambert--you have, I won't
say insulted, but humiliated me, and this is a treatment I will bear
from no man alive! My servants will attend you to the door, sir!''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>Saying
which, and rustling in his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) brocade dressing-gown, Mr. Warrington, with
much state, walked off to his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) bedroom.




<p/>CHAPTER XLIV. Contains what might, perhaps, have been expected


<p/>On the rejection of his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) peace-offerings, our warlike young American
chief chose to be in great wrath not only against Colonel Lambert, but
the whole of that gentleman's family. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has humiliated me before
the girls!''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>thought the young man. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and Mr. Wolfe, who were forever
preaching morality to me, and giving themselves airs of superiority and
protection, have again been holding me up to the family as a scapegrace
and prodigal. They are so virtuous that they won't shake me by the hand,
forsooth; and when I want to show them a little common gratitude, they
fling my presents in my face!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, sir, the things must be worth a little fortune!''  (<font color='red'><b>Parson Sampson/Parson</b></font>)</div>says Parson
Sampson, casting an eye of covetousness on the two morocco boxes,
in which, on their white satin cushions, reposed Mr. Sparks's golden
gewgaws.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They cost some money, Sampson,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>says the young man. <div class="bookquote">``Not that I would
grudge ten times the amount to people who have been kind to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, faith, sir, not if I know your honour!''  (<font color='red'><b>Sampson/Mr. Sampson</b></font>)</div>interjects Sampson, who
never lost a chance of praising his (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) young patron to his (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The repeater, they told me, was a great bargain, and worth a hundred
pounds at Paris. Little Miss Hetty I remember saying that she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) longed to
have a repeating watch.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, what a love!''  (<font color='red'><b>the chaplain</b></font>)</div>cries the chaplain, <div class="bookquote">``with a little circle of pearls
on the back, and a diamond knob for the handle! Why, `twould win any
woman's heart, Sir!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the chaplain</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There passes an apple-woman with a basket. I have a mind to fling the
thing out to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>cries Mr. Warrington, fiercely.

<p/>When Harry went out upon business, which took him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) to the City and the
Temple, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) parasite did not follow him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) very far into the Strand;
but turned away, owning that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had a terror of Chancery Lane, its
inhabitants, and precincts. Mr. Warrington went then to his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) broker, and
they walked to the Bank together, where they did some little business,
at the end of which, and after the signing of a trifling signature or
two, Harry departed with a certain number of crisp bank-notes in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
pocket. The broker took Mr. Warrington to one of the great dining-houses
for which the City was famous then as now; and afterwards showed Mr.
Warrington the Virginian walk upon `Change, through which Harry passed
rather shamefacedly. What would a certain lady in Virginia say, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
thought, if she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was carrying off in that bottomless
gambler's pocket a great portion of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) father's patrimony? Those are
all Virginia merchants, thinks he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), and they are all talking to one
another about me, and all saying, <div class="bookquote">``That is young Esmond, of Castlewood,
on the Potomac, Madam Esmond's son; and he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) has been losing his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) money at
play, and he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) has been selling out so much, and so much, and so much.''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) spirits did not rise until he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had passed under the traitors' heads
of Temple Bar, and was fairly out of the City. From the Strand Mr. Harry
walked home, looking in at St. James's Street by the way; but there was
nobody there as yet, the company not coming to the Chocolate-House till
a later hour.

<p/>Arrived at home, Mr. Harry pulls out his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) bundle of bank-notes; puts
three of them into a sheet of paper, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) seals carefully, having
previously written within the sheet the words, <div class="bookquote">``Much good may they
do you. H. E. W.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And this packet he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) directs to the Reverend Mr.
Sampson,--leaving it on the chimney-glass, with directions to his (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>)
servants to give it to that divine when he (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) should come in.

<p/>And now his (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) honour's phaeton is brought to the door, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) steps in,
thinking to drive round the park; but the rain coming on, or the east
wind blowing, or some other reason arising, his (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) honour turns his (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) horses'
heads down St. James's Street, and is back at White's at about three
o’clock. Scarce anybody has come in yet. It is the hour when folks are
at dinner. There, however, is my cousin Castlewood, lounging over the
Public Advertiser, having just come off from his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) duty at Court hard by.

<p/>Lord Castlewood is yawning over the Public Advertiser. What shall they
do? Shall they have a little piquet? Harry has no objections to a little
piquet. <div class="bookquote">``Just for an hour,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord</b></font>)</div>says Lord Castlewood. <div class="bookquote">``I dine at Arlington
Street at four.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Just for an hour,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Warrington; and they call
for cards.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Or shall we have `em in upstairs?''  (<font color='red'><b>lord</b></font>)</div>says my lord. <div class="bookquote">``Out of the noise?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly, out of the noise,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>says Harry.

<p/>At five o’clock a half-dozen of gentlemen have come in after their
dinner, and are at cards, or coffee, or talk. The folks from the
ordinary have not left the table yet. There the gentlemen of White's
will often sit till past midnight.

<p/>One toothpick points over the coffee-house blinds into the street.
<div class="bookquote">``Whose phaeton?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>asks Toothpick 1 of Toothpick 2.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The Fortunate Youth's,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>says No. 2.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not so fortunate the last three nights. Luck confoundedly against him (<font color='blue'><b>W.</b></font>).
Lost, last night, thirteen hundred to the table. Mr. Warrington been
here to-day, John?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Warrington is in the house now, sir. In the little tea-room with
Lord Castlewood since three o’clock. They are playing at piquet,''  (<font color='red'><b>John/John Armytage/Armytage</b></font>)</div>says
John.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What fun for Castlewood!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>says No. 1, with a shrug.

<p/>The second gentleman growls out an execration. <div class="bookquote">``Curse the fellow!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
says. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) has no right to be in this club at all. He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) doesn't pay if he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)
loses. Gentlemen ought not to play with him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>). Sir Miles Warrington told
me at court the other day, that Castlewood has owed him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) money on a bet
these three years.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Castlewood,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>says No. 1, <div class="bookquote">``don't lose if he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) plays alone. A large company
flurries him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>), you see--that's why he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) doesn't come to the table.''  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>And the
facetious gentleman grins, and shows all his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) teeth, polished perfectly
clean.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let's go up and stop `em,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>growls No. 2.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>asks the other. <div class="bookquote">``Much better look out a-window. Lamplighter going
up the ladder--famous sport. Look at that old putt in the chair: did you
ever see such an old quiz?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who is that just gone out of the house? As I live, it's Fortunatus! He (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>)
seems to have forgotten that his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) phaeton has been here, waiting all the
time. I bet you two to one he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) has been losing to Castlewood.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Jack, do you take me to be a fool?''  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>asks the one gentleman of the
other. <div class="bookquote">``Pretty pair of horses the youth has got. How he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) is flogging
`em!''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>And they see Mr. Warrington galloping up the street, and scared
coachmen and chairmen clearing before him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>): presently my Lord Castlewood
is seen to enter a chair, and go his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) way.

<p/>Harry drives up to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) own door. It was but a few yards, and those poor
horses have been beating the pavement all this while in the rain. Mr.
Gumbo is engaged at the door in conversation with a countrified-looking
lass, who trips off with a curtsey. Mr. Gumbo is always engaged with
some pretty maid or other.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Gumbo, has Mr. Sampson been here?''  (<font color='red'><b>Gumbo master</b></font>)</div>asks Gumbo's master from his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>)
driving-seat.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, sar. Mr. Sampson have not been here!''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>answers Mr. Warrington's
gentleman. Harry bids him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) to go upstairs and bring down a letter
addressed to Mr. Sampson.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Addressed to Mr. Sampson? Oh yes, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gumbo</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Gumbo, who can't read.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A sealed letter, stupid! on the mantelpiece, in the glass!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>says Harry;
and Gumbo leisurely retires to fetch that document. As soon as Harry has
it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) turns his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) horses' heads towards St. James's Street, and the
two gentlemen, still yawning out of the window at White's, behold the
Fortunate Youth, in an instant, back again.

<p/>As they passed out of the little tea-room where he (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>) and Lord Castlewood
had had their piquet together, Mr. Warrington had seen that several
gentlemen had entered the play-room, and that there was a bank there.
Some were already steadily at work, and had their gaming jackets on:
they kept such coats at the club, which they put on when they had a mind
to sit down to a regular night's play.

<p/>Mr. Warrington goes to the clerk's desk, pays his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) account of the
previous night, and, sitting down at the table, calls for fresh
counters. This has been decidedly an unlucky week with the Fortunate
Youth, and to-night is no more fortunate than previous nights have been.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) calls for more counters, and more presently. He (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) is a little pale and
silent, though very easy and polite when talked to. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) cannot win.

<p/>At last he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) gets up. <div class="bookquote">``Hang it! stay and mend your luck!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord</b></font>)</div>says Lord March,
who is sitting by his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) side with a heap of counters before him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>), green and
white. <div class="bookquote">``Take a hundred of mine, and go on!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have had enough for to-night, my lord,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>says Harry, and rises and
goes away, and eats a broiled bone in the coffee-room, and walks back to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) lodgings some time about midnight. A man after a great catastrophe
commonly sleeps pretty well. It is the waking in the morning which is
sometimes queer and unpleasant. Last night you proposed to Miss Brown:
you quarrelled over your cups with Captain Jones, and valorously pulled
his (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) nose: you played at cards with Colonel Robinson, and gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Robinson</b></font>)--oh,
how many I O U's! These thoughts, with a fine headache, assail you
in the morning watches. What a dreary, dreary gulf between to-day and
yesterday! It seems as if you are years older. Can't you leap back over
that chasm again, and is it not possible that Yesterday is but a dream?
There you are, in bed. No daylight in at the windows yet. Pull your
nightcap over your eyes, the blankets over your nose, and sleep away
Yesterday. Psha, man, it was but a dream! Oh no, no! The sleep won't
come. The watchman bawls some hour--what hour? Harry minds him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
has got the repeating watch under his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) pillow which he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had bought for
Hester. Ting, ting, ting! the repeating watch sings out six times in
the darkness, with a little supplementary performance indicating the
half-hour. Poor dear little Hester!--so bright, so gay, so innocent! he (<font color='blue'><b>Ting</b></font>)
would have liked her (<font color='blue'><b>Hester</b></font>) to have that watch. What will Maria say? -LRB-Oh, that
old Maria! what a bore she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) is beginning to be! he (<font color='blue'><b>Ting</b></font>) thinks.-RRB- What will
Madam Esmond at home say when she (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) hears that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ting</b></font>) has lost every shilling
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ting</b></font>) ready money--of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ting</b></font>) patrimony? All his (<font color='blue'><b>Ting</b></font>) winnings, and five
thousand pounds besides, in three nights. Castlewood could not have
played him (<font color='blue'><b>Ting</b></font>) false? No. My lord knows piquet better than Harry does, but
he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) would not deal unfairly with his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) own flesh and blood. No, no. Harry
is glad his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) kinsman, who wanted the money, has got it. And for not one
more shilling than he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) possessed, would he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) play. It was when he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) counted
up his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) losses at the gaming-table, and found they would cover all the
remainder of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) patrimony, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) passed the box and left the table.
But, O cursed bad company! O extravagance and folly! O humiliation and
remorse! <div class="bookquote">``Will my mother at home forgive me?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>thinks the young prodigal.
<div class="bookquote">``Oh, that I were there, and had never left it!''

 (<font color='red'><b>The London dawn peeps</b></font>)</div><p/>The dreary London dawn peeps at length through shutters and curtains.
The housemaid enters to light his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) honour's fire and admit the dun
morning into his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) windows. Her (<font color='blue'><b>housemaid</b></font>) Mr. Gumbo presently follows, who warms his (<font color='blue'><b>Gumbo</b></font>)
master's dressing-gown and sets out his (<font color='blue'><b>Gumbo</b></font>) shaving-plate and linen. Then
arrives the hairdresser to curl and powder his (<font color='blue'><b>Gumbo</b></font>) honour, whilst he (<font color='blue'><b>Gumbo</b></font>) reads
his (<font color='blue'><b>Gumbo</b></font>) morning's letters; and at breakfast-time comes that inevitable
Parson Sampson, with eager looks and servile smiles, to wait on his (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>)
patron. The parson would have returned yesterday according to mutual
agreement, but some jolly fellows kept him (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) to dinner at the St. Alban's,
and, faith, they made a night of it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Parson!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>groans Harry, ```twas the worst night you ever made in your
life! Look here, sir!''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here is a broken envelope with the words, `Much good may it do you,'
written within,''  (<font color='red'><b>the chaplain</b></font>)</div>says the chaplain, glancing at the paper.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Look on the outside, sir!''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>cries Mr. Warrington. <div class="bookquote">``The paper was
directed to you.''  (<font color='red'><b>The chaplain</b></font>)</div>The poor chaplain's countenance exhibited great alarm.
<div class="bookquote">``Has some one broke it open, sir?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) asks.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Some one, yes. I broke it open, Sampson. Had you come here as you
proposed yesterday afternoon, you would have found that envelope full of
bank-notes. As it is, they were all dropped at the infernal macco-table
last night.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What, all?''  (<font color='red'><b>Sampson/Mr. Sampson</b></font>)</div>says Sampson.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, all, with all the money I brought away from the city, and all the
ready money I have left in the world. In the afternoon I played piquet
with my cous--with a gentleman at White's--and he (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>) eased me of all the
money I had about me. Remembering that there was still some money left
here, unless you had fetched it, I came home and carried it back and
left it at the macco-table, with every shilling besides that belongs to
me--and--great heaven, Sampson, what's the matter, man?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's my luck, it's my usual luck,''  (<font color='red'><b>the chaplain</b></font>)</div>cries out the unfortunate chaplain,
and fairly burst into tears.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What! You are not whimpering like a baby at the loss of a loan of a
couple of hundred pounds?''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>cries out Mr. Warrington, very fierce and
angry. <div class="bookquote">``Leave the room, Gumbo! Confound you! why are you always poking
your woolly head in at that door!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Some one below wants to see master with a little bill,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gumbo</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Gumbo.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) to go to Jericho!''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>roars out Mr. Warrington. <div class="bookquote">``Let me see
nobody! I am not at home, sir, at this hour of the morning!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>A murmur or two, a scuffle is heard on the landing-place, and silence
finally ensues. Mr. Warrington's scorn and anger are not diminished by
this altercation. He (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) turns round savagely upon unhappy Sampson, who sits
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) head buried in his (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) breast.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hadn't you better take a bumper of brandy to keep your spirits up, Mr.
Sampson?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) asks. <div class="bookquote">``Hang it, man! don't be snivelling like a woman!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, it's not me!''  (<font color='red'><b>Sampson/Mr. Sampson</b></font>)</div>says Sampson, tossing his (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``I am used to it,
sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not you! Who, then? Are you crying because somebody else is hurt,
pray?''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>asks Mr. Warrington.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir!''  (<font color='red'><b>the chaplain</b></font>)</div>says the chaplain, with some spirit; <div class="bookquote">``because somebody else
is hurt, and through my fault. I have lodged for many years in London
with a bootmaker, a very honest man: and, a few days since, having a
perfect reliance upon--upon a friend who had promised to accommodate me
with a loan--I borrowed sixty pounds from my landlord which he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) was about
to pay to his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) own. I can't get the money. My poor landlord's goods will
be seized for rent; his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) wife and dear young children will be turned into
the street; and this honest family will be ruined through my fault. But,
as you say, Mr. Warrington, I ought not to snivel like a woman. I will
remember that you helped me once, and will bid you farewell, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the chaplain</b></font>)</div><p/>And, taking his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) broad-leafed hat, Mr. Chaplain walked out of the room.

<p/>An execration and a savage laugh, I am sorry to say, burst out of
Harry's lips at this sudden movement of the chaplain's. He (<font color='blue'><b>chaplain</b></font>) was in such
a passion with himself, with circumstances, with all people round about
him (<font color='blue'><b>chaplain</b></font>), that he (<font color='blue'><b>chaplain</b></font>) scarce knew where to turn, or what he (<font color='blue'><b>chaplain</b></font>) said. Sampson heard
the savage laughter, and then the voice of Harry calling from the
stairs, <div class="bookquote">``Sampson, Sampson! hang you! come back! It's a mistake! I beg
your pardon!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry</b></font>)</div>But the chaplain was cut to the soul, and walked on. Harry
heard the door of the street as the parson slammed it. It thumped on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
own breast. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) entered his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) room, and sank back on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) luxurious chair
there. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was Prodigal, amongst the swine--his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) foul remorses; they had
tripped him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) up, and were wallowing over him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). Gambling, extravagance,
debauchery, dissolute life, reckless companions, dangerous women--they
were all upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) in a herd, and were trampling upon the prostrate young
sinner.

<p/>Prodigal was not, however, yet utterly overcome, and had some fight left
in him (<font color='blue'><b>sinner</b></font>). Dashing the filthy importunate brutes aside, and, as it were,
kicking his (<font color='blue'><b>sinner</b></font>) ugly remembrances away from him (<font color='blue'><b>sinner</b></font>), Mr. Warrington seized
a great glass of that fire-water which he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) had recommended to poor
humiliated Parson Sampson, and, flinging off his (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) fine damask robe, rang
for the trembling Gumbo, and ordered his (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) coat. <div class="bookquote">``Not that!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>roars he (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>), as
Gumbo brings him (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) a fine green coat with plated buttons and a gold cord.
<div class="bookquote">``A plain suit--the plainer the better! The black clothes.''  (<font color='red'><b>master</b></font>)</div>And Gumbo
brings the mourning-coat which his (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) master had discarded for some months
past.

<p/>Mr. Harry then takes:--1, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) fine new gold watch; 2, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) repeater -LRB-that
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had bought for Hetty-RRB-, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) puts into his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) other fob; 3,
his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) necklace, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had purchased for Theo; 4, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) rings, of which
my gentleman must have half a dozen at least -LRB-with the exception of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) grandfather's old seal ring, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) kisses and lays down on the
pincushion again-RRB-; 5, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) three gold snuff boxes: and 6, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) purse,
knitted by his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) mother, and containing three shillings and sixpence and a
pocket-piece brought from Virginia: and, putting on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hat, issues from
his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) door.

<p/>At the landing he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) is met by Mr. Ruff, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) landlord, who bows and cringes
and puts into his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) honour's hand a strip of paper a yard long. <div class="bookquote">``Much
obliged if Mr. Warrington will settle. Mrs. Ruff has a large account
to make up to-day.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Ruff</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Ruff is a milliner. Mr. Ruff is one of the
head-waiters and aides-de-camp of Mr. Mackreth, the proprietor of
White's Club. The sight of the landlord does not add to the lodger's
good-humour.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) honour will have the kindness to settle the little
account?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Ruff</b></font>)</div>asks Mr. Ruff.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course I will settle the account,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>says Harry, glumly looking down
over Mr. Ruffs head from the stair above him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps Mr. Warrington will settle it now?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, Sir, I will not settle it now!''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Warrington, bullying
forward.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm very--very much in want of money, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>pleads the voice under him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Ruff is--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hang you, sir, get out of the way!''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>cries Mr. Warrington, ferociously,
and driving Mr. Ruff backward to the wall, sending him (<font color='blue'><b>Ruff</b></font>) almost
topsy-turvy down his (<font color='blue'><b>Ruff</b></font>) own landing, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ruff</b></font>) tramps down the stair, and walks
forth into Bond Street.

<p/>The Guards were at exercise at the King's Mews at Charing Cross, as
Harry passed, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) heard their drums and fifes, and looked in at the
gate, and saw them at drill. <div class="bookquote">``I can shoulder a musket at any rate,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) to himself gloomily, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) strode on. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) crossed St. Martin's
Lane -LRB-where he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) transacted some business-RRB-, and so made his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) way into Long
Acre, and to the bootmaker's house where friend Sampson lodged. The
woman of the house said Mr. Sampson was not at home, but had promised to
be at home at one; and, as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) knew Mr. Warrington, showed him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) up to the
parson's apartments, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) sate down, and, for want of occupation,
tried to read an unfinished sermon of the chaplain's. The subject was
the Prodigal Son. Mr. Harry did not take very accurate cognisance of the
sermon.

<p/>Presently he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) heard the landlady's shrill voice on the stair, pursuing
somebody who ascended, and Sampson rushed into the room, followed by the
sobbing woman.

<p/>At seeing Harry, Sampson started, and the landlady stopped. Absorbed
in her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) own domestic cares, she (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) had doubtless forgot that a visitor was
awaiting her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) lodger. <div class="bookquote">``There's only thirteen pound in the house, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>)
will be here at one, I tell you!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) was bawling out, as she (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) pursued
her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) victim.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hush, hush! my good creature!''  (<font color='red'><b>the chaplain</b></font>)</div>cries the gasping chaplain, pointing
to Harry, who rose from the window-seat. <div class="bookquote">``Don't you see Mr. Warrington?
I've business with him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>)--most important business. It will be all right, I
tell you!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) soothed and coaxed Mrs. Landlady out of the room, with
the crowd of anxious little ones hanging at her (<font color='blue'><b>Landlady</b></font>) coats.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sampson, I have come to ask your pardon again,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Warrington,
rising up. <div class="bookquote">``What I said to-day to you was very cruel and unjust, and
unlike a gentleman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not a word more, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>says the other, coldly and sadly, bowing and
scarcely pressing the hand which Harry offered him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I see you are still angry with me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>Harry continues.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, sir, an apology is an apology. A man of my station can ask for no
more from one of yours. No doubt you did not mean to give me pain. And
what if you did? And you are not the only one of the family who has,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
said, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) looked piteously round the room. <div class="bookquote">``I wish I had never known
the name of Esmond or Castlewood,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) continues, <div class="bookquote">``or that place yonder
of which the picture hangs over my fireplace, and where I have buried
myself these long, long years. My lord, your cousin, took a fancy to me,
said he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) would make my fortune, has kept me as his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) dependant till fortune
has passed by me, and now refuses me my due.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How do you mean your due, Mr. Sampson?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>asks Harry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I mean three years' salary which he (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) owes me as chaplain of Castlewood.
Seeing you could give me no money, I went to his (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) lordship this morning
and asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>). I fell on my knees, and asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>), sir. But his (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) lordship
had none. He (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) gave me civil words, at least -LRB-saving your presence, Mr.
Warrington-RRB-, but no money--that is, five guineas, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) declared was
all he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) had and which I took. But what are five guineas amongst so many
Oh, those poor little children! those poor little children!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Lord Castlewood said he (<font color='blue'><b>Castlewood</b></font>) had no money?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>cries out Harry. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Castlewood</b></font>) won eleven
hundred pounds, yesterday, of me at piquet--which I paid him (<font color='blue'><b>Castlewood</b></font>) out of this
pocket-book.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I dare say, sir, I dare say, sir. One can't believe a word his (<font color='blue'><b>Castlewood</b></font>) lordship
says, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sampson/Mr. Sampson</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Sampson; <div class="bookquote">``but I am thinking of execution in this
house, and ruin upon these poor folks to-morrow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sampson/Mr. Sampson</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That need not happen,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Warrington. <div class="bookquote">``Here are eighty guineas,
Sampson. As far as they go, God help you! `Tis all I have to give you.
I wish to my heart I could give more as I promised; but you did not come
at the right time, and I am a poor devil now until I get my remittances
from Virginia.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The chaplain</b></font>)</div><p/>The chaplain gave a wild look of surprise, and turned quite white. He (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>)
flung himself down on his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) knees and seized Harry's hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Great powers, sir!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>says he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``are you a guardian angel that Heaven hath
sent me? You quarrelled with my tears this morning, Mr. Warrington. I
can't help them now. They burst, sir, from a grateful heart. A rock of
stone would pour them forth, sir, before such goodness as yours! May
Heaven eternally bless you, and give you prosperity! May my unworthy
prayers be heard in your behalf, my friend, my best benefactor! May--''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, nay! get up, friend--get up, Sampson!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>says Harry, whom the
chaplain's adulation and fine phrases rather annoyed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am glad to have been able to do you a service--sincerely glad.
There--there! Don't be on your knees to me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To Heaven who sent you to me, sir!''  (<font color='red'><b>the chaplain</b></font>)</div>cries the chaplain. Mrs. Weston!
Mrs. Weston!''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is it, sir?''  (<font color='red'><b>the landlady</b></font>)</div>says the landlady, instantly, who, indeed, had been
at the door the whole time. <div class="bookquote">``We are saved, Mrs. Weston! We are saved!''
 (<font color='red'><b>the chaplain</b></font>)</div>cries the chaplain. <div class="bookquote">``Kneel, kneel, woman, and thank our benefactor!
Raise your innocent voices, children, and bless him (<font color='blue'><b>benefactor</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>A universal
whimper arose round Harry, which the chaplain led off, whilst the
young Virginian stood, simpering and well pleased, in the midst of this
congregation. They would worship, do what he (<font color='blue'><b>chaplain</b></font>) might. One of the children,
not understanding the kneeling order, and standing up, the mother
fetched her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) a slap on the ear, crying, <div class="bookquote">``Drat it, Jane, kneel down, and
bless the gentleman, I tell `ee!'' (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>... We leave them performing this sweet
benedictory service. Mr. Harry walks off from Long Acre, forgetting
almost the griefs of the former four or five days, and tingling with the
consciousness of having done a good action.


<p/>The young woman with whom Gumbo had been conversing on that evening
when Harry drove up from White's to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) lodging, was Mrs. Molly, from
Oakhurst, the attendant of the ladies there. Wherever that fascinating
Gumbo went, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) left friends and admirers in the servants'-hall. I think
we said it was on a Wednesday evening he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) and Mrs. Molly had fetched a
walk together, and they were performing the amiable courtesies incident
upon parting, when Gumbo's master came up, and put an end to their
twilight whisperings and what not.

<p/>For many hours on Wednesday, on Thursday, on Friday, a pale little
maiden sate at a window in Lord Wrotham's house, in Hill Street, her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
mother and sister wistfully watching her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) would not go out. They
knew whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was expecting. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) passed the door once, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) might
have thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) was coming, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) did not. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) went into a neighbouring
house. Papa had never told the girls of the presents which Harry had
sent, and only whispered a word or two to their mother regarding his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
quarrel with the young Virginian.

<p/>On Saturday night there was an opera of Mr. Handel's, and papa brought
home tickets for the gallery. Hetty went this evening. The change would
do her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) good, Theo thought, and--and, perhaps there might be Somebody
amongst the fine company; but Somebody was not there; and Mr. Handel's
fine music fell blank upon the poor child. It might have been Signor
Bononcini's, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) would have scarce known the difference.

<p/>As the children are undressing and taking off those smart new satin
sacks in which they appeared at the Opera, looking so fresh and so
pretty amongst all the tawdry rouged folks, Theo remarks how very sad
and woebegone Mrs. Molly their maid appears. Theo is always anxious when
other people seem in trouble; not so Hetty, now, who is suffering, poor
thing, one of the most selfish maladies which ever visits mortals. Have
you ever been amongst insane people, and remarked how they never, never
think of any but themselves?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is the matter, Molly?''  (<font color='red'><b>kind Theo</b></font>)</div>asks kind Theo: and indeed, Molly has been
longing to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) young ladies. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, Miss Theo! Oh, Miss Hetty!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) says. <div class="bookquote">``How ever can I tell you? Mr. Gumbo have been here, Mr.
Warrington's coloured gentleman, miss; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gumbo</b></font>) says Mr. Warrington have
been took by two bailiffs this evening, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) comes out of Sir Miles
Warrington's house three doors off.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Silence!''  (<font color='red'><b>Theo</b></font>)</div>cries Theo, quite sternly. Who is it that gives those three
shrieks? It is Mrs. Molly, who chooses to scream, because Miss Hetty has
fallen fainting from her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) chair.




<p/>CHAPTER XLV. In which Harry finds two Uncles


<p/>We have all of us, no doubt, had a fine experience of the world, and a
vast variety of characters have passed under our eyes; but there is one
sort of men not an uncommon object of satire in novels and plays--of
whom I confess to have met with scarce any specimens at all in my
intercourse with this sinful mankind. I mean, mere religious hypocrites,
preaching for ever, and not believing a word of their own sermons;
infidels in broad brims and sables, expounding, exhorting, comminating,
blessing, without any faith in their own paradise, or fear about their
pandemonium. Look at those candid troops of hobnails clumping to church
on a Sunday evening; those rustling maid-servants in their ribbons whom
the young apprentices follow; those little regiments of schoolboys;
those trim young maidens and staid matrons, marching with their
glistening prayer-books, as the chapel bell chinks yonder -LRB-passing
Ebenezer, very likely, where the congregation of umbrellas, great
bonnets, and pattens, is by this time assembled under the flaring
gas-lamps-RRB-. Look at those! How many of them are hypocrites, think you?
Very likely the maid-servant is thinking of her (<font color='blue'><b>troops</b></font>) sweetheart: the grocer
is casting about how he (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) can buy that parcel of sugar, and whether the
County Bank will take any more of his (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) paper: the head-schoolboy is
conning Latin verses for Monday's exercise: the young scapegrace
remembers that after his (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) service and sermon, there will be papa's
exposition at home, but that there will be pie for supper: the clerk who
calls out the psalm has his (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) daughter in trouble, and drones through his (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>)
responses scarcely aware of their meaning: the very moment the parson
hides his (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) face on his (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) cushion, he (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) may be thinking of that bill which is
coming due on Monday. These people are not heavenly-minded; they are of
the world, worldly, and have not yet got their feet off of it; but they
are not hypocrites, look you. Folks have their religion in some handy
mental lock-up, as it were--a valuable medicine, to be taken in
ill health; and a man administers his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) nostrum to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) neighbour, and
recommends his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) private cure for the other's complaint. <div class="bookquote">``My dear madam,
you have spasms? You will find these drops infallible!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You have been
taking too much wine, my good sir? By this pill you may defy any evil
consequences from too much wine, and take your bottle of port daily.''  (<font color='red'><b>physic</b></font>)</div>Of
spiritual and bodily physic, who are more fond and eager dispensers than
women? And we know that, especially a hundred years ago, every lady
in the country had her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) still-room, and her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) medicine chest, her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) pills,
powders, potions, for all the village round.

<p/>My Lady Warrington took charge of the consciences and the digestions of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) husband's tenants and family. She (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) had the faith and health of the
servants'-hall in keeping. Heaven can tell whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) knew how to
doctor them rightly: but, was it pill or doctrine, she (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) administered one
or the other with equal belief in her (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) own authority, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) disciples
swallowed both obediently. She (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) believed herself to be one of the most
virtuous, self-denying, wise, learned women in the world; and, dinning
this opinion perpetually into the ears of all round about her (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>), succeeded
in bringing not few persons to join in her (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) persuasion.

<p/>At Sir Miles's dinner there was so fine a sideboard of plate, and such
a number of men in livery, that it required some presenter: of mind
to perceive that the beer was of the smallest which the butler brought
round in the splendid tankard, and that there was but one joint of
mutton on the grand silver dish. When Sir Miles called the King's
health, and smacked his (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) jolly lips over his (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) wine, he (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) eyed it and the
company as if the liquor was ambrosia. He (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) asked Harry Warrington whether
they had port like that in Virginia? He (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) said that was nothing to the
wine Harry should taste in Norfolk. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) praised the wine so, that Harry
almost believed that it was good, and winked into his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) own glass, trying
to see some of the merits which his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) uncle perceived in the ruby nectar.

<p/>Just as we see in many a well-regulated family of this present century,
the Warringtons had their two paragons. Of the two grown daughters, the
one was the greatest beauty, the other the greatest genius and angel of
any young lady then alive, as Lady Warrington told Harry. The eldest,
the Beauty, was engaged to dear Tom Claypool, the fond mother informed
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) cousin Harry in confidence. But the second daughter, the Genius and
Angel, was for ever set upon our young friend to improve his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) wits and
morals. She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) sang to him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) at the harpsichord--rather out of tune for
an angel, Harry thought; she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) was ready with advice, instruction,
conversation--with almost too much instruction and advice, thought
Harry, who would have far preferred the society of the little cousin
who reminded him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) of Fanny Mountain at home. But the last-mentioned young
maiden after dinner retired to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) nursery commonly. Beauty went off
on her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) own avocations; mamma had to attend to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) poor or write her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
voluminous letters; papa dozed in his (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) arm-chair; and the Genius remained
to keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) young cousin company.

<p/>The calm of the house somehow pleased the young man, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) liked
to take refuge there away from the riot and dissipation in which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
ordinarily lived. Certainly no welcome could be kinder than that which
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) got. The doors were opened to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) at all hours. If Flora was not at
home, Dora was ready to receive him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). Ere many days' acquaintance, he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) and
his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) little cousin Miles had been to have a galloping-match in the Park,
and Harry, who was kind and generous to every man alive who came near
him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), had in view the purchase of a little horse for his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) cousin, far
better than that which the boy rode, when the circumstances occurred
which brought all our poor Harry's coaches and horses to a sudden
breakdown.

<p/>Though Sir Miles Warrington had imagined Virginia to be an island, the
ladies were much better instructed in geography, and anxious to hear
from Harry all about his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) home and his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) native country. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) part,
was not averse to talk about it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) described to them the length and
breadth of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) estate; the rivers which it coasted; the produce which
it bore. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had had with a friend a little practice of surveying in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) boyhood. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) made a map of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) county, with some fine towns here and
there, which, in truth, were but log-huts -LRB-but, for the honour of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
country, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was desirous that they should wear as handsome a look as
possible-RRB-. Here was Potomac; here was James river; here were the wharves
whence his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) mother's ships and tobacco were brought to the sea. In truth,
the estate was as large as a county. He (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) did not brag about the place
overmuch. To see the handsome young fellow, in a fine suit of velvet and
silver lace, making his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) draught, pointing out this hill and that forest
or town, you might have imagined him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) a travelling prince describing the
realms of the queen his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) mother. He (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) almost fancied himself to be so at
times. He (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) had miles where gentlemen in England had acres. Not only Dora
listened but the beauteous Flora bowed her (<font color='blue'><b>Flora</b></font>) fair head and heard him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) with
attention. Why, what was young Tom Claypool, their brother baronet's son
in Norfolk with his (<font color='blue'><b>Claypool</b></font>) great boots, his (<font color='blue'><b>Claypool</b></font>) great voice, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Claypool</b></font>) heirdom to
a poor five thousand acres, compared to this young American prince and
charming stranger? Angel as she (<font color='blue'><b>Flora</b></font>) was, Dora began to lose her (<font color='blue'><b>Dora</b></font>) angelic
temper, and to twit Flora for a flirt. Claypool in his (<font color='blue'><b>Claypool</b></font>) red waistcoat,
would sit dumb before the splendid Harry in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) ruffles and laces,
talking of March and Chesterfield, Selwyn and Bolingbroke, and the whole
company of macaronis. Mamma began to love Harry more and more as a son.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Flora</b></font>) was anxious about the spiritual welfare of those poor Indians, of
those poor negroes in Virginia. What could she (<font color='blue'><b>Flora</b></font>) do to help dear Madam
Esmond -LRB-a precious woman, she (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) knew!-RRB- in the good work? She (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) had a serious
butler and housekeeper: they were delighted with the spiritual behaviour
and sweet musical gifts of Gumbo.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! Harry, Harry! you have been a sad wild boy! Why did you not come
sooner to us, sir, and not lose your time amongst the spendthrifts and
the vain world? But `tis not yet too late. We must reclaim thee, dear
Harry! Mustn't we, Sir Miles? Mustn't we Dora? Mustn't we, Flora?''

 (<font color='red'><b>The ladies</b></font>)</div><p/>The three ladies all look up to the ceiling. They will reclaim the dear
prodigal. It is which shall reclaim him (<font color='blue'><b>butler</b></font>) most. Dora sits by and watches
Flora. As for mamma when the girls are away, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dora</b></font>) talks to him (<font color='blue'><b>butler</b></font>) more and
more seriously, more and more tenderly. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dora</b></font>) will be a mother to him (<font color='blue'><b>butler</b></font>) in
the absence of his (<font color='blue'><b>butler</b></font>) own admirable parent. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dora</b></font>) gives him (<font color='blue'><b>butler</b></font>) a hymn-book.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Dora</b></font>) kisses him (<font color='blue'><b>butler</b></font>) on the forehead. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dora</b></font>) is actuated by the purest love,
tenderness, religious regard, towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Dora</b></font>) dear, wayward, wild, amiable
nephew.

<p/>Whilst these sentimentalities were going on, it is to be presumed that
Mr. Warrington kept his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) own counsel about his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) affairs out-of-doors,
which we have seen were in the very worst condition. He (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) who had been
favoured by fortune for so many weeks was suddenly deserted by her (<font color='blue'><b>Dora</b></font>), and
a few days had served to kick down all his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) heap of winnings. Do we say
that my Lord Castlewood, his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) own kinsman, had dealt unfairly by the
young Virginian, and in the course of a couple of afternoons' closet
practice had robbed him (<font color='blue'><b>Virginian</b></font>)? We would insinuate nothing so disrespectful to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Virginian</b></font>) lordship's character; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Virginian</b></font>) had won from Harry every shilling which
properly belonged to him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), and would have played him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) for his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) reversions,
but that the young man flung up his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hands when he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) saw himself so
far beaten, and declared that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) must continue the battle no more.
Remembering that there still remained a spar out of the wreck, as
it were--that portion which he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had set aside for poor Sampson--Harry
ventured it at the gaming-table; but that last resource went down along
with the rest of Harry's possessions, and Fortune fluttered off in the
storm, leaving the luckless adventurer almost naked on the shore.

<p/>When a man is young and generous and hearty the loss of money scarce
afflicts him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). Harry would sell his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) horses and carriages, and diminish
his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) train of life. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wanted immediate supplies of money, would not
his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) Aunt Bernstein be his (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>) banker, or his (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>) kinsman who had won so much
from him (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>), or his (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>) kind Uncle Warrington and Lady Warrington who were
always talking virtue and benevolence, and declaring that they loved
him (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>) as a son? He (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>) would call upon these, or any one of them whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>) might
choose to favour, at his (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>) leisure; meanwhile, Sampson's story of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>)
landlord's distress touched the young gentleman, and, in order to raise
a hasty supply for the clergyman, he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) carried off all his (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) trinkets to a
certain pawnbroker's shop in St. Martin's Lane.

<p/>Now this broker was a relative or partner of that very Mr. Sparks
of Tavistock Street, from whom Harry had purchased--purchased did we
say?--no; taken the trinkets which he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had intended to present to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
Oakhurst friends; and it chanced that Mr. Sparks came to visit his (<font color='blue'><b>Sparks</b></font>)
brother-tradesman very soon after Mr. Warrington had disposed of his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>)
goods. Recognising immediately the little enamelled diamond-handled
repeater which he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) had sold to the Fortunate Youth, the jeweller broke
out into expressions regarding Harry which I will not mention here,
being already accused of speaking much too plainly. A gentleman who
is acquainted with a pawnbroker, we may be sure has a bailiff or two
amongst his (<font color='blue'><b>bailiff</b></font>) acquaintances; and those bailiffs have followers who, at the
bidding of the impartial Law, will touch with equal hand the fiercest
captain's epaulet or the finest macaroni's shoulder. The very gentlemen
who had seized upon Lady Maria at Tunbridge were set upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) cousin in
London. They easily learned from the garrulous Gumbo that his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) honour was
at Sir Miles Warrington's house in Hill Street, and whilst the black was
courting Mrs. Lambert's maid at the adjoining mansion, Mr. Costigan and
his (<font color='blue'><b>Costigan</b></font>) assistant lay in wait for poor Harry, who was enjoying the delights
of intercourse with a virtuous family circle assembled round his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
aunt's table. Never had Uncle Miles been more cordial, never had Aunt
Warrington been more gracious, gentle, and affectionate; Flora looked
unusually lovely, Dora had been more than ordinarily amiable. At
parting, my lady gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) both her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) hands, and called benedictions from
the ceiling down upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>). Papa had said in his (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>) most jovial manner,
<div class="bookquote">``Hang it, nephew! when I was thy age I should have kissed two such fine
girls as Do and Flo ere this, and my own flesh and blood too! Don't tell
me! I should, my Lady Warrington! Odds-fish! `tis the boy blushes, and
not the girls! I think--I suppose they are used to it. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Papa</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Papa!''  (<font color='red'><b>the virgins</b></font>)</div>cry the virgins.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sir Miles!''  (<font color='red'><b>the august mother</b></font>)</div>says the august mother at the same instant.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There, there!''  (<font color='red'><b>papa</b></font>)</div>says papa. <div class="bookquote">``A kiss won't do no harm, and won't tell no
tales: will it, nephew Harry?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I suppose, during the utterance of the
above three brief phrases, the harmless little osculatory operation has
taken place, and blushing cousin Harry has touched the damask cheek of
cousin Flora and cousin Dora.

<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) goes downstairs with his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) uncle, mamma makes a speech to the
girls, looking, as usual, up to the ceiling, and saying, <div class="bookquote">``What precious
qualities your poor dear cousin has! What shrewdness mingled with his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>)
simplicity, and what a fine genteel manner, though upon mere worldly
elegance I set little store. What a dreadful pity to think that such a
vessel should ever be lost! We must rescue him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>), my loves. We must
take him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) away from those wicked companions, and those horrible
Castlewoods--not that I would speak ill of my neighbours. But I shall
hope, I shall pray, that he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) may be rescued from his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) evil courses!''  (<font color='red'><b>the girls</b></font>)</div>And
again Lady Warrington eyes the cornice in a most determined manner, as
the girls wistfully look towards the door behind which their interesting
cousin has just vanished.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) uncle will go downstairs with him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) calls <div class="bookquote">``God bless you, my boy!''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>most affectionately: he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) presses Harry's hand, and repeats his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) valuable
benediction at the door. As it closes, the light from the hall within
having sufficiently illuminated Mr. Warrington's face and figure, two
gentlemen, who have been standing on the opposite side of the way,
advance rapidly, and one of them takes a strip of paper out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>)
pocket, and putting his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) hand upon Mr. Warrington's shoulder, declares
him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) prisoner. A hackney-coach is in attendance, and poor Harry goes
to sleep in Chancery Lane.

<p/>Oh, to think that a Virginian prince's back should be slapped by a
ragged bailiffs follower!--that Madam Esmond's son should be in a
spunging-house in Cursitor Street! I do not envy our young prodigal his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)
rest on that dismal night. Let us hit him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) now he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) is down, my beloved
young friends. Let us imagine the stings of remorse keeping him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) wakeful
on his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) dingy pillow; the horrid jollifications of other hardened inmates
of the place ringing in his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) ears from the room hard by, where they sit
boozing; the rage and shame and discomfiture. No pity on him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>), I say,
my honest young gentlemen, for you, of course, have never indulged in
extravagance or folly, or paid the reckoning of remorse.




<p/>CHAPTER XLVI. Chains and Slavery


<p/>Remorse for past misdeeds and follies Harry sincerely felt, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
found himself a prisoner in that dismal lock-up house, and wrath and
annoyance at the idea of being subjected to the indignity of arrest; but
the present unpleasantry he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) felt sure could only be momentary. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had
twenty friends who would release him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) from his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) confinement: to which of
them should he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) apply, was the question. Mr. Draper, the man of business,
who had been so obsequious to him (<font color='blue'><b>Draper</b></font>): his (<font color='blue'><b>Draper</b></font>) kind uncle the Baronet, who had
offered to make his (<font color='blue'><b>Draper</b></font>) house Harry's home, who loved him (<font color='blue'><b>Draper</b></font>) as a son: his (<font color='blue'><b>Draper</b></font>)
cousin Castlewood, who had won such large sums from him (<font color='blue'><b>Draper</b></font>): his (<font color='blue'><b>Draper</b></font>) noble
friends at the Chocolate-House, his (<font color='blue'><b>Draper</b></font>) good Aunt Bernstein--any one of
these Harry felt sure would give him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) a help in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) trouble, though some
of the relatives, perhaps, might administer to him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) a little scolding for
his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) imprudence. The main point was, that the matter should be transacted
quietly, for Mr. Warrington was anxious that as few as possible of the
public should know how a gentleman of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) prodigious importance had been
subject to such a vulgar process as an arrest. As if the public does
not end by knowing everything it cares to know. As if the dinner I shall
have to-day, and the hole in the stocking which I wear at this present
writing, can be kept a secret from some enemy or other who has a mind
to pry it out--though my boots are on, and my door was locked when I
dressed myself! I mention that hole in the stocking for sake of example
merely. The world can pry out everything about us which it has a mind to
know. But then there is this consolation, which men will never accept
in their own cases, that the world doesn't care. Consider the amount of
scandal it has been forced to hear in its time, and how weary and blase
it must be of that kind of intelligence. You are taken to prison,
and fancy yourself indelibly disgraced? You are bankrupt under odd
circumstances? You drive a queer bargain with your friends and are found
out, and imagine the world will punish you? Psha! Your shame is only
vanity. Go and talk to the world as if nothing had happened, and nothing
has happened. Tumble down; brush the mud off your clothes; appear with
a smiling countenance, and nobody cares. Do you suppose Society is going
to take out its pocket-handkerchief and be inconsolable when you die?
Why should it care very much, then, whether your worship graces yourself
or disgraces yourself? Whatever happens it talks, meets, jokes, yawns,
has its dinner, pretty much as before. Therefore don't be so conceited
about yourself as to fancy your private affairs of so much importance,
mi fili. Whereas Mr. Harry Warrington chafed and fumed as though all the
world was tingling with the touch of that hand which had been laid on
his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) sublime shoulder.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A pretty sensation my arrest must have created at the club!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>thought
Harry. <div class="bookquote">``I suppose that Mr. Selwyn will be cutting all sorts of jokes
about my misfortune, plague take him (<font color='blue'><b>Selwyn</b></font>)! Everybody round the table will
have heard of it. March will tremble about the bet I have with him (<font color='blue'><b>Selwyn</b></font>);
and, faith, `twill be difficult to pay him (<font color='blue'><b>Selwyn</b></font>) when I lose. They will all
be setting up a whoop of congratulation at the Savage, as they call me,
being taken prisoner. How shall I ever be able to appear in the world
again? Whom shall I ask to come to my help? No,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), with his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
mingled acuteness and simplicity, <div class="bookquote">``I will not send in the first instance
to any of my relations or my noble friends at White's. I will have
Sampson's counsel. He (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) has often been in a similar predicament, and
will know how to advise me.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Accordingly, as soon as the light of dawn
appeared, after an almost intolerable delay--for it seemed to Harry as
if the sun had forgotten to visit Cursitor Street in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) rounds that
morning--and as soon as the inmates of the house of bondage were
stirring, Mr. Warrington despatched a messenger to his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) friend in Long
Acre, acquainting the chaplain with the calamity just befallen him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>),
and beseeching his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) reverence to give him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) the benefit of his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) advice and
consolation.

<p/>Mr. Warrington did not know, to be sure, that to send such a message to
the parson was as if he (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I am fallen amongst the lions. Come
down, my dear friend, into the pit with me.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Harry very likely thought
Sampson's difficulties were over; or, more likely still, was so much
engrossed with his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) own affairs and perplexities, as to bestow little
thought upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) neighbour's. Having sent off his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) missive, the captive's
mind was somewhat more at ease, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) condescended to call for
breakfast, which was brought to him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) presently. The attendant who served
him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) morning repast asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) would order dinner, or
take his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) meal at Mrs. Bailiff's table with some other gentlemen? No.
Mr. Warrington would not order dinner. He (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) should quit the place before
dinner-time, he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) informed the chamberlain who waited on him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) in that grim
tavern. The man went away, thinking no doubt that this was not the first
young gentleman who had announced that he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was going away ere two hours
were over. <div class="bookquote">``Well, if your honour does stay, there is good beef and
carrot at two o’clock,''  (<font color='red'><b>the sceptic</b></font>)</div>says the sceptic, and closes the door on Mr.
Harry and his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) solitary meditations.

<p/>Harry's messenger to Mr. Sampson brought back a message from that
gentleman to say that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) would be with his (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) patron as soon as might be:
but ten o’clock came, eleven o’clock, noon, and no Sampson. No Sampson
arrived, but about twelve Gumbo with a portmanteau of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) master's
clothes, who flung himself, roaring with grief, at Harry's feet: and
with a thousand vows of fidelity, expressed himself ready to die, to
sell himself into slavery over again, to do anything to rescue his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
beloved Master Harry from this calamitous position. Harry was touched
with the lad's expressions of affection, and told him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) to get up from
the ground where he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was grovelling on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) knees, embracing his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) master's.
<div class="bookquote">``All you have to do, sir, is to give me my clothes to dress, and to hold
your tongue about this business. Mind you, not a word, sir, about it to
anybody!''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Warrington, severely.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh no, sir, never to nobody!''  (<font color='red'><b>master</b></font>)</div>says Gumbo, looking most solemnly, and
proceeded to dress his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) master carefully, who had need of a change and a
toilette after his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) yesterday's sudden capture, and night's dismal rest.
Accordingly Gumbo flung a dash of powder in Harry's hair, and arrayed
his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) master carefully and elegantly, so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) made Mr. Warrington look
as fine and splendid as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) had been stepping into his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) chair to go to
St. James's.

<p/>Indeed all that love and servility could do Mr. Gumbo faithfully did for
his (<font color='blue'><b>Gumbo</b></font>) master, for whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Gumbo</b></font>) had an extreme regard and attachment. But there
were certain things beyond Gumbo's power. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gumbo</b></font>) could not undo things which
were done already; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gumbo</b></font>) could not help lying and excusing himself when
pressed upon points disagreeable to himself. The language of slaves is
lies -LRB-I mean black slaves and white-RRB-. The creature slinks away and hides
with subterfuges, as a hunted animal runs to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gumbo</b></font>) covert at the sight
of man, the tyrant and pursuer. Strange relics of feudality, and
consequence of our ever-so-old social life! Our domestics -LRB-are they not
men, too, and brethren?-RRB- are all hypocrites before us. They never speak
naturally to us, or the whole truth. We should be indignant: we should
say, confound their impudence: we should turn them out of doors if they
did. But quo me rapis, O my unbridled hobby?

<p/>Well, the truth is, that as for swearing not to say a word about his (<font color='blue'><b>pursuer</b></font>)
master's arrest--such an oath as that was impossible to keep for, with
a heart full of grief, indeed, but with a tongue that never could cease
wagging, bragging, joking, and lying, Mr. Gumbo had announced the
woeful circumstance to a prodigious number of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gumbo</b></font>) acquaintances already,
chiefly gentlemen of the shoulder-knot and worsted lace. We have
seen how he (<font color='blue'><b>Gumbo</b></font>) carried the news to Colonel Lambert's and Lord Wrotham's
servants: he (<font color='blue'><b>Wrotham</b></font>) had proclaimed it at the footman's club to which he (<font color='blue'><b>Wrotham</b></font>)
belonged, and which was frequented by the gentlemen of some of the first
nobility. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wrotham</b></font>) had subsequently condescended to partake of a mug of ale
in Sir Miles Warrington's butler's room, and there had repeated and
embellished the story. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) had gone off to Madame Bernstein's
people, with some of whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) was on terms of affectionate intercourse,
and had informed that domestic circle of his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) grief and, his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) master being
captured, and there being no earthly call for his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) personal services that
evening, Gumbo had stepped up to Lord Castlewood's, and informed the
gentry there of the incident which had just come to pass. So when,
laying his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) hand on his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) heart, and with gushing floods of tears, Gumbo
says, in reply to his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) master's injunction, <div class="bookquote">``Oh no, master! nebber to
nobody!''  (<font color='red'><b>master</b></font>)</div>we are in a condition to judge of the degree of credibility
which ought to be given to the lad's statement.

<p/>The black had long completed his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) master's toilet: the dreary breakfast
was over: slow as the hours went to the prisoner, still they were
passing one after another, but no Sampson came in accordance with the
promise sent in the morning. At length, some time after noon, there
arrived, not Sampson, but a billet from him (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>), sealed with a moist wafer,
and with the ink almost yet wet. The unlucky divine's letter ran as
follows:


<p/>``Oh, sir, dear sir, I have done all that a man can at the command and
in the behalf of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) patron! You did not know, sir, to what you were
subjecting me, did you? Else, if I was to go to prison, why did I not
share yours, and why am I in a lock-up house three doors off?

<p/>``Yes. Such is the fact. As I was hastening to you, knowing full well the
danger to which I was subject:--but what danger will I not affront at
the call of such a benefactor as Mr. Warrington hath been to me?--I was
seized by two villains who had a writ against me, and who have lodged me
at Naboth's, hard by, and so close to your honour, that we could almost
hear each other across the garden walls of the respective houses where
we are confined.

<p/>``I had much and of importance to say, which I do not care to write down
on paper regarding your affairs. May they mend! May my cursed fortunes,
too, better themselves, is the prayer of--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your honour's afflicted Chaplain-in-Ordinary, J. S.''


 (<font color='red'><b>Sampson/Mr. Sampson</b></font>)</div><p/>And now, as Mr. Sampson refuses to speak, it will be our duty to
acquaint the reader with those matters whereof the poor chaplain did not
care to discourse on paper.

<p/>Gumbo's loquacity had not reached so far as Long Acre, and Mr. Sampson
was ignorant of the extent of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) patron's calamity until he (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) received
Harry's letter and messenger from Chancery Lane. The divine was still
ardent with gratitude for the service Mr. Warrington had just conferred
on him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>), and eager to find some means to succour his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) distressed patron.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) knew what a large sum Lord Castlewood had won from his (<font color='blue'><b>Castlewood</b></font>) cousin, had
dined in company with his (<font color='blue'><b>Castlewood</b></font>) lordship on the day before, and now ran to
Lord Castlewood's house, with a hope of arousing him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) to some pity for
Mr. Warrington. Sampson made a very eloquent and touching speech to
Lord Castlewood about his (<font color='blue'><b>Castlewood</b></font>) kinsman's misfortune, and spoke with a real
kindness and sympathy, which, however, failed to touch the nobleman to
whom he (<font color='blue'><b>nobleman</b></font>) addressed himself.

<p/>My lord peevishly and curtly put a stop to the chaplain's passionate
pleading. <div class="bookquote">``Did I not tell you, two days since, when you came for money,
that I was as poor as a beggar, Sampson,''  (<font color='red'><b>lordship</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>chaplain</b></font>) lordship, <div class="bookquote">``and has
anybody left me a fortune since? The little sum I won from my cousin was
swallowed up by others. I not only can't help Mr. Warrington, but, as I
pledge you my word, not being in the least aware of his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) calamity, I had
positively written to him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) this morning to ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) to help me.''  (<font color='red'><b>lordship</b></font>)</div>And
a letter to this effect did actually reach Mr. Warrington from his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>)
lodgings, whither it had been despatched by the penny post.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I must get him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) money, my lord. I know he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) had scarcely anything left in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) pocket after relieving me. Were I to pawn my cassock and bands, he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>)
must have money,''  (<font color='red'><b>the chaplain</b></font>)</div>cried the chaplain.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Amen. Go and pawn your bands, your cassock, anything you please. Your
enthusiasm does you credit,''  (<font color='red'><b>lord</b></font>)</div>said my lord; and resumed the reading of
his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) paper, whilst, in the deepest despondency, poor Sampson left him (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>).

<p/>My Lady Maria meanwhile had heard that the chaplain was with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>)
brother, and conjectured what might be the subject on which they had
been talking. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) seized upon the parson as he (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) issued from out his (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>)
fruitless interview with my lord. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) drew him (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) into the dining-room: the
strongest marks of grief and sympathy were in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) countenance. <div class="bookquote">``Tell me,
what is this has happened to Mr. Warrington?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your ladyship, then, knows?''  (<font color='red'><b>the chaplain</b></font>)</div>asked the chaplain.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have I not been in mortal anxiety ever since his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) servant brought the
dreadful news last night?''  (<font color='red'><b>lady</b></font>)</div>asked my lady. <div class="bookquote">``We had it as we came from the
opera--from my Lady Yarmouth's box--my lord, my Lady Castlewood, and I.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``His (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) lordship, then, did know?''  (<font color='red'><b>Sampson/Mr. Sampson</b></font>)</div>continued Sampson.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Benson told the news when we came from the playhouse to our tea,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Maria/Lady Maria/Lady Maria Esmond</b></font>)</div>repeats Lady Maria.

<p/>The chaplain lost all patience and temper at such duplicity. <div class="bookquote">``This
is too bad,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>chaplain</b></font>) said, with an oath; and he (<font color='blue'><b>chaplain</b></font>) told Lady Maria of the
conversation which he (<font color='blue'><b>chaplain</b></font>) had just had with Lord Castlewood, and of the
latter's refusal to succour his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) cousin, after winning great sums of
money from him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>), and with much eloquence and feeling, of Mr. Warrington's
most generous behaviour to himself.

<p/>Then my Lady Maria broke out with a series of remarks regarding her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) own
family, which were by no means complimentary to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) own kith and kin.
Although not accustomed to tell truth commonly, yet, when certain
families fall out, it is wonderful what a number of truths they will
tell about one another. With tears, imprecations, I do not like to
think how much stronger language, Lady Maria burst into a furious and
impassioned tirade, in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) touched upon the history of almost all
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) noble family. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) complimented the men and the ladies alike; she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>)
shrieked out interrogatories to Heaven, inquiring why it had made such
-LRB-never mind what names she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) called her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) brothers, sisters, uncles, aunts,
parents-RRB-; and, emboldened with wrath, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) dashed at her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) brother's
library door, so shrill in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) outcries, so furious in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) demeanour,
that the alarmed chaplain, fearing the scene which might ensue, made for
the street.

<p/>My lord, looking up from the book or other occupation which engaged
him (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>), regarded the furious woman with some surprise, and selected a good
strong oath to fling at her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), as it were, and check her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) onset.

<p/>But, when roused, we have seen how courageous Maria could be. Afraid
as she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) was ordinarily of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) brother, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) was not in a mood to be
frightened now by any language of abuse or sarcasm at his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) command.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So, my lord!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) called out, <div class="bookquote">``you sit down with him (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) in private to
cards, and pigeon him (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>)! You get the poor boy's last shilling, and you

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So that infernal chaplain has been telling tales!''  (<font color='red'><b>lord</b></font>)</div>says my lord.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dismiss him (<font color='blue'><b>chaplain</b></font>): do!

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What can the women be in a family where there are such men?''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>says the
lady.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Effectivement!''  (<font color='red'><b>lord</b></font>)</div>says my lord, with a shrug of his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) shoulder.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What can we be, when our fathers and brothers are what they are? We are
bad enough, but what are you? I say, you neither have courage--no, nor
honour, nor common feeling. As your equals won't play with you, my

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We are all playing our own game, I suppose. Haven't you played and won
one, Maria? Is it you that are squeamish of a sudden about the poor

a better offer?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord</b></font>)</div>cried my Lord. <div class="bookquote">``If you won't have him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), one of the
Warrington girls will, I promise you; and the old Methodist woman in

Esmond? A greater fool, I mean, than in common?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should be a fool if I thought that either of my brothers could act
like an honest man, Eugene!''  (<font color='red'><b>Maria/Lady Maria/Lady Maria Esmond</b></font>)</div>said Maria. <div class="bookquote">``I am a fool to expect that you
will be other than you are; that if you find any relative in distress
you will help him (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>); that if you can meet with a victim you won't fleece

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Fleece him (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>)! Psha! What folly are you talking! Have you not seen, from
the course which the lad has been running for months past, how he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) would
end? If I had not won his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) money, some other would? I never grudged thee
thy little plans regarding him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>). Why shouldst thou fly in a passion,
because I have just put out my hand to take what he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) was offering to all
the world? I reason with you, I don't know why, Maria. You should be old
enough to understand reason, at any rate. You think this money belonged
of right to Lady Maria Warrington and her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) children? I tell you that in
three months more every shilling would have found its way to White's
macco-table, and that it is much better spent in paying my debts. So
much for your ladyship's anger, and tears, and menaces, and naughty
language. See! I am a good brother, and repay them with reason and kind
words.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My good brother might have given a little more than kind words to the
lad from whom he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) has just taken hundreds,''  (<font color='red'><b>the sister</b></font>)</div>interposed the sister of this

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Great heavens, Maria! Don't you see that even out of this affair,
unpleasant as it seems, a clever woman may make her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) advantage,''  (<font color='red'><b>lord</b></font>)</div>cries my

<p/><div class="bookquote">``As thus. I name no names; I meddle in no person's business, having
quite enough to do to manage my own cursed affairs. But suppose I happen
to know of a case in another family which may be applicable to ours. It
is this. A green young lad of tolerable expectations, comes up from the
country to his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) friends in town--never mind from what country: never
mind to what town. An elderly female relative, who has been dragging her (<font color='blue'><b>female</b></font>)
spinsterhood about these--how many years shall we say?--extort a promise
of marriage from my young gentleman, never mind on what conditions.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My lord, do you want to insult your sister as well as to injure your
cousin?''  (<font color='red'><b>Maria/Lady Maria/Lady Maria Esmond</b></font>)</div>asks Maria.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My good child, did I say a single word about fleecing or cheating, or
pigeoning, or did I fly into a passion when you insulted me? I know the
allowance that must be made for your temper, and the natural folly of
your sex. I say I treated you with soft words--I go on with my story.
The elderly relative extracts a promise of marriage from the young lad,
which my gentleman is quite unwilling to keep. No, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) won't keep it.
He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) is utterly tired of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) elderly relative: he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) will plead his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) mother's
refusal: he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) will do anything to get out of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) promise.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; if he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was one of us Esmonds, my Lord Castlewood. But this is a
man of honour we are speaking of,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maria/Lady Maria/Lady Maria Esmond</b></font>)</div>cried Maria, who, I suppose, admired
truth in others, however little she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) saw it in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) own family.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not contradict either of my dear sister's remarks. One of us
would fling the promise to the winds, especially as it does not exist in
writing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My lord!''  (<font color='red'><b>Maria/Lady Maria/Lady Maria Esmond</b></font>)</div>gasps out Maria.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Bah! I know all. That little coup of Tunbridge was played by the Aunt
Bernstein with excellent skill. The old woman is the best man of our
family. While you were arrested, your boxes were searched for the
Mohock's letters to you. When you were let loose, the letters had
disappeared, and you said nothing, like a wise woman, as you are
sometimes. You still hanker after your Cherokee. Soit. A woman of your
mature experience knows the value of a husband. What is this little loss
of two or three hundred pounds?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not more than three hundred, my lord?''  (<font color='red'><b>Maria/Lady Maria/Lady Maria Esmond</b></font>)</div>interposes Maria.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Eh! never mind a hundred or two, more or less. What is this loss at
cards? A mere bagatelle! You are playing for a principality. You want
your kingdom in Virginia; and if you listen to my opinion, the little
misfortune which has happened to your swain is a piece of great
good-fortune to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't understand you, my lord.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``C’est possible; but sit down, and I will explain what I mean in a
manner suited to your capacity.''  (<font color='red'><b>Maria/Lady Maria/Lady Maria Esmond</b></font>)</div>And so Maria Esmond, who had advanced
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) brother like a raging lion, now sate down at his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) feet like a
gentle lamb.


<p/>Madame de Bernstein was not a little moved at the news of her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) nephew's
arrest, which Mr. Gumbo brought to Clarges Street on the night of the
calamity. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) would have cross-examined the black, and had further
particulars respecting Harry's mishap; but Mr. Gumbo, anxious to carry
his (<font color='blue'><b>Gumbo</b></font>) intelligence to other quarters, had vanished when her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) ladyship sent
for him (<font color='blue'><b>Gumbo</b></font>). Her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) temper was not improved by the news, or by the sleepless
night which she (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) spent. I do not envy the dame de compagnie who played
cards with her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>), or the servant who had to lie in her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) chamber. An arrest
was an everyday occurrence, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) knew very well as a woman of the
world. Into what difficulties had her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) scapegrace of a nephew fallen? How
much money should she (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) be called upon to pay to release him (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>)? And had
he (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) run through all his (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) own? Provided he (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) had not committed himself
very deeply, she (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) was quite disposed to aid him (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) liked even his (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>)
extravagances and follies. He (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) was the only being in the world on whom,
for long, long years, that weary woman had been able to bestow a little
natural affection. So, on their different beds, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) and Harry were lying
wakeful together; and quite early in the morning the messengers which
each sent forth on the same business may have crossed each other.

<p/>Madame Bernstein's messenger was despatched to the chambers of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) man
of business, Mr. Draper, with an order that Mr. D. should ascertain for
what sums Mr. Warrington had been arrested, and forthwith repair to the
Baroness. Draper's emissaries speedily found out that Mr. Warrington was
locked up close beside them, and the amount of detainers against him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>)
so far. Were there other creditors, as no doubt there were, they
would certainly close upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) when they were made acquainted with his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>)
imprisonment.

<p/>To Mr. Sparks, the jeweller, for those unlucky presents, so much; to the
landlord in Bond Street, for board, fire, lodging, so much: these were
at present the only claims against Mr. Warrington, Mr. Draper found. He (<font color='blue'><b>Draper</b></font>)
was ready, at a signal from her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) ladyship, to settle them at a moment.
The jeweller's account ought especially to be paid, for Mr. Harry had
acted most imprudently in taking goods from Mr. Sparks on credit, and
pledging them with a pawnbroker. He (<font color='blue'><b>Sparks</b></font>) must have been under some immediate
pressure for money; intended to redeem the goods immediately, meant
nothing but what was honourable of course; but the affair would have an
ugly look, if made public, and had better be settled out of hand. <div class="bookquote">``There
cannot be the least difficulty regarding a thousand pounds more or less,
for a gentleman of Mr. Warrington's rank and expectations,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bernstein/Madame de Bernstein/Madame Bernstein</b></font>)</div>said Madame
de Bernstein. Not the least: her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) ladyship knew very well that there
were funds belonging to Mr. Warrington, on which money could be at once
raised with her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) ladyship's guarantee.

<p/>Should he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) go that instant and settle the matter with Messrs. Amos? Mr.
Harry might be back to dine with her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) at two, and to confound the people
at the clubs, <div class="bookquote">``who are no doubt rejoicing over his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) misfortunes,''  (<font color='red'><b>the people</b></font>)</div>said
the compassionate Mr. Draper.

<p/>But the Baroness had other views. <div class="bookquote">``I think, my good Mr. Draper,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>)
said, <div class="bookquote">``that my young gentleman has sown wild oats enough; and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Draper</b></font>)
comes out of prison I should like him (<font color='blue'><b>Draper</b></font>) to come out clear, and without any
liabilities at all. You are not aware of all his (<font color='blue'><b>Draper</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No gentleman ever does tell all his (<font color='blue'><b>Draper</b></font>) debts, madam,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Draper/Draper</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Draper; <div class="bookquote">``no
one I ever had to deal with.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Draper/Draper</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There is one which the silly boy has contracted, and from which he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
ought to be released, Mr. Draper. You remember a little circumstance
which occurred at Tunbridge Wells in the autumn? About which I sent up
my man Case to you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``When your ladyship pleases to recall it, I remember it--not otherwise,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Draper/Draper</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Draper, with a bow. <div class="bookquote">``A lawyer should be like a Popish
confessor,--what is told him (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) is a secret for ever, and for everybody.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Madame</b></font>)</div>So we must not whisper Madame Bernstein's secret to Mr. Draper; but the
reader may perhaps guess it from the lawyer's conduct subsequently.

<p/>The lawyer felt pretty certain that ere long he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) would receive a summons
from the poor young prisoner in Cursitor Street, and waited for that
invitation before he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) visited Mr. Warrington. Six-and-thirty hours passed
ere the invitation came, during which period Harry passed the dreariest
two days which he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) ever remembered to have spent.

<p/>There was no want of company in the lock-up house, the bailiff's rooms
were nearly always full; but Harry preferred the dingy solitude of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
own room to the society round his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) landlady's table, and it was only
on the second day of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) arrest, and when his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) purse was emptied by the
heavy charges of the place, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) made up his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) mind to apply to
Mr. Draper. He (<font color='blue'><b>Draper</b></font>) despatched a letter then to the lawyer at the Temple,
informing him (<font color='blue'><b>Draper</b></font>) of his (<font color='blue'><b>Draper</b></font>) plight, and desiring him (<font color='blue'><b>Draper</b></font>), in an emphatic
postscript, not to say one word about the matter to his (<font color='blue'><b>Draper</b></font>) aunt, Madame de
Bernstein.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>) had made up his (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>) mind not to apply to the old lady except at the
very last extremity. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had treated him (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>) with so much kindness that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>)
revolted from the notion of trespassing on her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) bounty, and for a while
tried to please himself with the idea that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>) might get out of durance
without her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) even knowing that any misfortune at all had befallen him (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>).
There seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>) something humiliating in petitioning a woman for
money. No! He (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>) would apply first to his (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>) male friends, all of whom might
help him (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>) if they would. It had been his (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>) intention to send Sampson to one
or other of them as a negotiator, had not the poor fellow been captured
on his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) way to succour his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) friend.

<p/>Sampson gone, Harry was obliged to have recourse to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) own negro
servant, who was kept on the trot all day between Temple Bar and the
Court end of the town with letters from his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) unlucky master. Firstly,
then, Harry sent off a most private and confidential letter to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
kinsman, the Right Honourable the Earl of Castlewood, saying how he (<font color='blue'><b>Earl</b></font>) had
been cast into prison, and begging Castlewood to lend him (<font color='blue'><b>Earl</b></font>) the amount
of the debt. <div class="bookquote">``Please to keep my application, and the cause of it, a
profound secret from the dear ladies,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>wrote poor Harry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Was ever anything so unfortunate?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord</b></font>)</div>wrote back Lord Castlewood, in
reply. <div class="bookquote">``I suppose you have not got my note of yesterday? It must be
lying at your lodgings, where--I hope in heaven!--you will soon be, too.
My dear Mr. Warrington, thinking you were as rich as Croesus--otherwise
I never should have sate down to cards with you--I wrote to you
yesterday, begging you to lend me some money to appease some hungry duns
whom I don't know how else to pacify. My poor fellow! every shilling
of your money went to them, and but for my peer's privilege I might be
hob-and-nob with you now in your dungeon. May you soon escape from it,
is the prayer of your sincere CASTLEWOOD.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>This was the result of application number one: and we may imagine that
Mr. Harry read the reply to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) petition with rather a blank face. Never
mind! There was kind, jolly Uncle Warrington. Only last night his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) aunt
had kissed him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) and loved him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) like a son. His (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) uncle had called down
blessings on his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) head, and professed quite a paternal regard for him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>).
With a feeling of shyness and modesty in presence of those virtuous
parents and family. Harry had never said a word about his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wild doings,
or his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) horse-racings, or his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) gamblings, or his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) extravagances. It must
all out now. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) must confess himself a Prodigal and a Sinner, and ask
for their forgiveness and aid. So Prodigal sate down and composed a
penitent letter to Uncle Warrington, and exposed his (<font color='blue'><b>Uncle</b></font>) sad case, and
besought him (<font color='blue'><b>Uncle</b></font>) to come to the rescue. Was not that a bitter nut to crack
for our haughty young Virginian? Hours of mortification and profound
thought as to the pathos of the composition did Harry pass over that
letter; sheet after sheet of Mr. Amos's sixpence-a-sheet letter-paper
did he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) tear up before the missive was complete, with which poor
blubbering Gumbo -LRB-much vilified by the bailiff's followers and
parasites, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>bailiff</b></font>) was robbing, as they conceived, of their perquisites-RRB-
went his (<font color='blue'><b>bailiff</b></font>) way.

<p/>At evening the faithful negro brought back a thick letter in his (<font color='blue'><b>negro</b></font>) aunt's
handwriting. Harry opened the letter with a trembling hand. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) thought
it was full of bank-notes. Ah me! it contained a sermon -LRB-Daniel in the
Lions' Den-RRB- by Mr. Whitfield, and a letter from Lady Warrington saying
that, in Sir Miles's absence from London, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) was in the habit of
opening his (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) letters, and hence, perforce, was become acquainted with a
fact which she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) deplored from her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) inmost soul to learn, namely, that her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>)
nephew Warrington had been extravagant and was in debt. Of course, in
the absence of Sir Miles, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) could not hope to have at command such
a sum as that for which Mr. Warrington wrote, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) sent him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>)
heartfelt prayers, her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) deepest commiseration, and a discourse by dear
Mr. Whitfield, which would comfort him (<font color='blue'><b>Whitfield</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Whitfield</b></font>) present -LRB-alas! she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) feared
not undeserved-RRB- calamity. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) added profuse references to particular
Scriptural chapters which would do him (<font color='blue'><b>Whitfield</b></font>) good. If she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) might speak of
things worldly, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) said, at such a moment, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) would hint to Mr.
Warrington that his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) epistolary orthography was anything but correct. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>)
would not fail for her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) part to comply with his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) express desire that his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>)
dear cousins should know nothing of this most painful circumstance,
and with every wish for his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) welfare here and elsewhere, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) subscribed
herself his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) loving aunt, MARGARET WARRINGTON.

<p/>Poor Harry hid his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) face between his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hands, and sate for a while with
elbows on the greasy table blankly staring into the candle before him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>).
The bailiff's servant, who was touched by his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) handsome face, suggested a
mug of beer for his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) honour, but Harry could not drink, nor eat the meat
that was placed before him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). Gumbo, however, could, whose grief did not
deprive him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) of appetite, and who, blubbering the while, finished all
the beer, and all the bread and the meat. Meanwhile, Harry had finished
another letter, with which Gumbo was commissioned to start again, and
away the faithful creature ran upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) errand.

<p/>Gumbo ran as far as White's Club, to which house he (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>) was ordered in the
first instance to carry the letter, and where he (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>) found the person
to whom it was addressed. Even the prisoner, for whom time passed so
slowly, was surprised at the celerity with which his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) negro had performed
his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) errand.

<p/>At least the letter which Harry expected had not taken long to write.
<div class="bookquote">``My lord wrote it at the hall-porter's desk, while I stood there then
with Mr Mr. Morris,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Gumbo, and the letter was to this effect:--


<p/>``DEAR SIR--I am sorry I cannot comply with your wish, I'm short of
money at present, having paid large sums to you as well as to other
gentlemen.--Yours obediently, MARCH AND R.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Henry Warrington, Esq.''


 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did Lord March say anything?''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>asked Mr. Warrington looking very pale.

<p/>``He (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) say it was the coolest thing he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) ever knew. So did Mr. Morris. He (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>)
showed him (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) your letter, Master Harry. Yes, Mr. Morris say, `Dam his (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>)
imperence!''' added Gumbo.

<p/>Harry burst into such a yell of laughter that his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) landlord thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
had good news, and ran in in alarm lest he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was about to lose his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) tenant.
But by this time poor Harry's laughter was over, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was flung down
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) chair gazing dismally in the fire.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I--I should like to smoke a pipe of Virginia''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) groaned.

<p/>Gumbo burst into tears: he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) flung himself at Harry's knees. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) kissed his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
knees and his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hands. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, master, my dear master, what will they say at
home?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) sobbed out.

<p/>The jailor was touched at the sight of the black's grief and fidelity,
and at Harry's pale face as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) sank back in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) chair quite overcome and
beaten by his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) calamity.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your honour ain't eat anything these two days,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>the man said, in a
voice of rough pity. <div class="bookquote">``Pluck up a little, sir. You aren't the first
gentleman who has been in and out of grief before this. Let me go down
and get you a glass of punch and a little supper.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My good friend,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>said Harry, a sickly smile playing over his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) white
face, <div class="bookquote">``you pay ready money for everything in this house, don't you? I
must tell you that I haven't a shilling left to buy a dish of meat. All
the money I have I want for letter-paper.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, master, my master!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>roared out Gumbo. <div class="bookquote">``Look here, my dear Master
Harry! Here's plenty of money--here's twenty-three five-guineas. Here's
gold moidore from Virginia--here--no, not that--that's keepsakes the
girls gave me. Take everything--everything. I go sell myself to-morrow
morning; but here's plenty for to-night, master!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``God bless you, Gumbo!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>Harry said, laying his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hand on the lad's woolly
head. <div class="bookquote">``You are free if I am not, and Heaven forbid I should not take the
offered help of such a friend as you. Bring me some supper: but the pipe
too, mind--the pipe too!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>And Harry ate his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) supper with a relish: and
even the turnkeys and bailiff's followers, when Gumbo went out of the
house that night, shook hands with him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), and ever after treated him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) well.




<p/>CHAPTER XLVII. Visitors in Trouble


<p/>Mr. Gumbo's generous and feeling conduct soothed and softened the angry
heart of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gumbo</b></font>) master, and Harry's second night in the spunging-house was
passed more pleasantly than the first. Somebody at least there was to
help and compassionate with him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). Still, though softened in that one
particular spot, Harry's heart was hard and proud towards almost all
the rest of the world. They were selfish and ungenerous, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) thought.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) pious Aunt Warrington, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) lordly friend March, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) cynical cousin
Castlewood,--all had been tried, and were found wanting. Not to avoid
twenty years of prison would he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) stoop to ask a favour of one of them
again. Fool that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had been, to believe in their promises, and confide
in their friendship! There was no friendship in this cursed, cold,
selfish country. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) would leave it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) would trust no Englishman, great
or small. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) would go to Germany, and make a campaign with the king; or
he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) would go home to Virginia, bury himself in the woods there, and
hunt all day; become his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) mother's factor and land-steward; marry Polly
Broadbent, or Fanny Mountain; turn regular tobacco-grower and farmer; do
anything, rather than remain amongst these English fine gentlemen. So he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>)
arose with an outwardly cheerful countenance, but an angry spirit; and
at an early hour in the morning the faithful Gumbo was in attendance
in his (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) master's chamber, having come from Bond Street, and brought Mr.
Harry's letters thence. <div class="bookquote">``I wanted to bring some more clothes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>honest
Gumbo said; <div class="bookquote">``but Mr. Ruff, the landlord, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ruff</b></font>) wouldn't let me bring no
more.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry did not care to look at the letters: he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) opened one, two, three;
they were all bills. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) opened a fourth; it was from the landlord, to
say that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) would allow no more of Mr. Warrington's things to go out of
the house,--that unless his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) bill was paid he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) should sell Mr. W.'s goods
and pay himself: and that his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) black man must go and sleep elsewhere. He (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>)
would hardly let Gumbo take his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) own clothes and portmanteau away. The
black said he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) had found refuge elsewhere--with some friends at Lord
Wrotham's house. <div class="bookquote">``With Colonel Lambert's people,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gumbo</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Gumbo,
looking very hard at his (<font color='blue'><b>Gumbo</b></font>) master. ``And Miss Hetty she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) fall down in a
faint, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) hear you taken up; and Mr. Lambert, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) very good man,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) say to me this morning, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) say, `Gumbo, you tell your master if
he (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) want me he (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) send to me, and I come to him (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>).'''

<p/>Harry was touched when he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) heard that Hetty had been afflicted by his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
misfortune. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) did not believe Gumbo's story about her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) fainting; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
was accustomed to translate his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) black's language and to allow for
exaggeration. But when Gumbo spoke of the Colonel the young Virginian's
spirit was darkened again. <div class="bookquote">``I send to Lambert''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Gumbo</b></font>) thought, grinding his (<font color='blue'><b>Gumbo</b></font>)
teeth, <div class="bookquote">``the man who insulted me, and flung my presents back in my face!
If I were starving I would not ask him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) for a crust!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And presently,
being dressed, Mr. Warrington called for his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) breakfast, and despatched
Gumbo with a brief note to Mr. Draper in the Temple, requiring that
gentleman's attendance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The note was as haughty as if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was writing to one of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) negroes, and
not to a freeborn English gentleman,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Draper/Draper</b></font>)</div>Draper said; whom indeed Harry had
always treated with insufferable condescension. <div class="bookquote">``It's all very well
for a fine gentleman to give himself airs; but for a fellow in a
spunging-house! Hang him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Draper/Draper</b></font>)</div>says Draper, <div class="bookquote">``I've a great mind not to
go!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Draper/Draper</b></font>)</div>Nevertheless, Mr. Draper did go, and found Mr. Warrington in his (<font color='blue'><b>Draper</b></font>)
misfortune even more arrogant than he (<font color='blue'><b>Draper</b></font>) had ever been in the days of his (<font color='blue'><b>Draper</b></font>)
utmost prosperity. Mr. W. sat on his (<font color='blue'><b>W.</b></font>) bed, like a lord, in a splendid
gown with his (<font color='blue'><b>W.</b></font>) hair dressed. He (<font color='blue'><b>W.</b></font>) motioned his (<font color='blue'><b>W.</b></font>) black man to fetch him (<font color='blue'><b>W.</b></font>) a
chair.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Excuse me, madam, but such haughtiness and airs I ain't accustomed to!''
 (<font color='red'><b>the attorney</b></font>)</div>said the outraged attorney.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Take a chair and go on with your story, my good Mr. Draper!''  (<font color='red'><b>Bernstein/Madame de Bernstein/Madame Bernstein</b></font>)</div>said
Madame de Bernstein, smiling, to whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>) went to report proceedings.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Draper</b></font>) was amused at the lawyer's anger. She (<font color='blue'><b>Draper</b></font>) liked her (<font color='blue'><b>Draper</b></font>) nephew for being
insolent in adversity.

<p/>The course which Draper was to pursue in his (<font color='blue'><b>Draper</b></font>) interview with Harry
had been arranged between the Baroness and her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) man of business on the
previous day. Draper was an able man, and likely in most cases to do a
client good service: he (<font color='blue'><b>Draper</b></font>) failed in the present instance because he (<font color='blue'><b>Draper</b></font>) was
piqued and angry, or, more likely still, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Draper</b></font>) could not understand
the gentleman with whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Draper</b></font>) had to deal. I presume that he (<font color='blue'><b>Draper</b></font>) who casts his (<font color='blue'><b>Draper</b></font>)
eye on the present page is the most gentle of readers. Gentleman, as
you unquestionably are, then, my dear sir, have you not remarked in
your dealings with people who are no gentlemen, that you offend them not
knowing the how or the why? So the man who is no gentleman offends you
in a thousand ways of which the poor creature has no idea himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
does or says something which provokes your scorn. He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) perceives that
scorn -LRB-being always on the watch, and uneasy about himself, his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) manners
and behaviour-RRB- and he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) rages. You speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) naturally, and he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) fancies
still that you are sneering at him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>). You have indifference towards
him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>), but he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) hates you, and hates you the worse because you don't
care. <div class="bookquote">``Gumbo, a chair to Mr. Draper!''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Warrington, folding his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>)
brocaded dressing-gown round his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) legs as he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) sits on the dingy bed. <div class="bookquote">``Sit
down, if you please, and let us talk my business over. Much obliged to
you for coming so soon in reply to my message. Had you heard of this
piece of ill-luck before?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Draper/Draper</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Draper had heard of the circumstance. <div class="bookquote">``Bad news travel quick, Mr.
Warrington,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Draper</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``and I was eager to offer my humble services as
soon as ever you should require them. Your friends, your family, will be
much pained that a gentleman of your rank should be in such a position.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have been very imprudent, Mr. Draper. I have lived beyond my means.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Draper/Draper</b></font>)</div>-LRB-Mr. Draper bowed.-RRB- <div class="bookquote">``I played in company with gentlemen who were much
richer than myself, and a cursed run of ill-luck has carried away all my
ready money, leaving me with liabilities to the amount of five hundred
pounds, and more.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Five hundred now in the office,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Draper/Draper</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Draper.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, this is such a trifle that I thought by sending to one or two
friends, yesterday, I could have paid my debt and gone home without
further to do. I have been mistaken; and will thank you to have the
kindness to put me in the way of raising the money as soon as may be.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Draper/Draper</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Draper said <div class="bookquote">``Hm!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Draper/Draper</b></font>)</div>and pulled a very grave and long face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, sir, it can be done!''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Warrington, staring at the lawyer.

<p/>It not only could be done, but Mr. Draper had proposed to Madame
Bernstein on the day before instantly to pay the money, and release
Mr. Warrington. That lady had declared she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) intended to make the young
gentleman her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) heir. In common with the rest of the world, Draper
believed Harry's hereditary property in Virginia to be as great in
money-value as in extent. He (<font color='blue'><b>Draper</b></font>) had notes in his (<font color='blue'><b>Draper</b></font>) pocket, and Madame
Bernstein's order to pay them under certain conditions: nevertheless,
when Harry said, <div class="bookquote">``It can be done!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>Draper pulled his (<font color='blue'><b>Draper</b></font>) long face, and
said, <div class="bookquote">``It can be done in time, sir; but it will require a considerable
time. To touch the property in England which is yours on Mr. George
Warrington's death, we must have the event proved, the trustees
released: and who is to do either? Lady Esmond Warrington in Virginia,
of course, will not allow her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) son to remain in prison, but we must wait
six months before we hear from her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>). Has your Bristol agent any authority
to honour your drafts?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Draper/Draper</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>agent</b></font>) is only authorised to pay me two hundred pounds a year,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>says Mr.
Warrington. <div class="bookquote">``I suppose I have no resource, then, but to apply to my
aunt, Madame de Bernstein. She (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) will be my security.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) ladyship will do anything for you, sir; she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) has said so to me,
often and often,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lawyer</b></font>)</div>said the lawyer; <div class="bookquote">``and, if she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) gives the word at that
moment you can walk out of this place.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the lawyer</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Go to her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>), then, from me, Mr. Draper. I did not want to have troubled
my relations: but rather than continue in this horrible needless
imprisonment, I must speak to her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>). Say where I am, and what has befallen
me. Disguise nothing! And tell her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>), that I confide in her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) affection
and kindness for me to release me from this--this disgrace,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>and Mr.
Warrington's voice shook a little, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) passed his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) hand across his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>)
eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Draper/Draper</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Draper, eyeing the young man, <div class="bookquote">``I was with her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) ladyship
yesterday, when we talked over the whole of this here most unpleasant--I
won't say as you do, disgraceful business.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you mean, sir? Does Madame de Bernstein know of my misfortune?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>asked Harry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Every circumstance, sir; the pawning the watches, and all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry turned burning red. <div class="bookquote">``It is an unfortunate business, the pawning
them watches and things which you had never paid for,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lawyer</b></font>)</div>continued the
lawyer. The young man started up from the bed, looking so fierce that
Draper felt a little alarmed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It may lead to litigation and unpleasant remarks being made, in court,
sir. Them barristers respect nothing; and when they get a feller in the
box--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Great Heaven, sir, you don't suppose a gentleman of my rank can't take
a watch upon credit without intending to cheat the tradesman?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>cried
Harry, in the greatest agitation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course you meant everything that's honourable; only, you see, the
law mayn't happen to think so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Draper/Draper</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Draper, winking his (<font color='blue'><b>Draper</b></font>) eye. -LRB-<div class="bookquote">``Hang
the supercilious beast; I touch him (<font color='blue'><b>tradesman</b></font>) there!-RRB- Your aunt says it's the most
imprudent thing ever she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) heard of--to call it by no worse name.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You call it by no worse name yourself, Mr. Draper?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>says Harry,
speaking each word very slow, and evidently trying to keep a command of
himself.

<p/>Draper did not like his (<font color='blue'><b>Draper</b></font>) looks. ``Heaven forbid that I should say anything
as between gentleman and gentleman,--but between me and my client, it's
my duty to say, `Sir, you are in a very unpleasant scrape,' just as a
doctor would have to tell his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) patient, `Sir, you are very ill.'''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And you can't help me to pay this debt off,--and you have come only to
tell me that I may be accused of roguery?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>says Harry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of obtaining goods under false pretences? Most undoubtedly, yes. I
can't help it, sir. Don't look as if you would knock me down. -LRB-Curse
him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>), I am making him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) wince, though.-RRB- A young gentleman, who has only two
hundred a year from his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) ma', orders diamonds and watches, and takes `em
to a pawnbroker. You ask me what people will think of such behaviour,
and I tell you honestly. Don't be angry with me, Mr. Warrington.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Go on, sir!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>says Harry, with a groan.

<p/>The lawyer thought the day was his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) own. <div class="bookquote">``But you ask if I can't help
to pay this debt off? And I say Yes--and that here is the money in my
pocket to do it now, if you like--not mine, sir, my honoured client's,
your aunt, Lady Bernstein. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>) has a right to impose her (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>) conditions,
and I've brought `em with me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell them, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Harry/Mr. Harry Warrington</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Harry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They are not hard. They are only for your own good: and if you say Yes,
we can call a hackney-coach, and go to Clarges Street together, which
I have promised to go there, whether you will or no. Mr. Warrington, I
name no names, but there was a question of marriage between you and a
certain party.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>said Harry; and his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) countenance looked more cheerful than it had
yet done.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``To that marriage my noble client, the Baroness, is most averse--having
other views for you, and thinking it will be your ruin to marry a
party,--of noble birth and title it is true; but, excuse me, not of
first-rate character, and so much older than yourself. You had given an
imprudent promise to that party.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) has it still,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Warrington.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It has been recovered. She (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) dropped it by an accident at Tunbridge,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Draper/Draper</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Draper, <div class="bookquote">``so my client informed me; indeed her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) ladyship showed
it me, for the matter of that. It was wrote in bl--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Draper/Draper</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never mind, sir!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>cries Harry, turning almost as red as the ink which
he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had used to write his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) absurd promise, of which the madness and folly
had smote him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) with shame a thousand times over.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``At the same time letters, wrote to you, and compromising a noble
family, were recovered,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lawyer</b></font>)</div>continues the lawyer. <div class="bookquote">``You had lost `em. It was
no fault of yours. You were away when they were found again. You may
say that that noble family, that you yourself, have a friend such as few
young men have. Well, sir, there's no earthly promise to bind you--only
so many idle words said over a bottle, which very likely any gentleman
may forget. Say you won't go on with this marriage--give me and my noble
friend your word of honour. Cry off, I say, Mr. W.! Don't be such a
d--fool, saving your presence, as to marry an old woman who has jilted
scores of men in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) time. Say the word, and I step downstairs, pay
every shilling against you in the office, and put you down in my coach,
either at your aunt's or at White's Club, if you like, with a couple of
hundred in your pocket. Say yes; and give us your hand! There's no use
in sitting grinning behind these bars all day!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Draper/Draper</b></font>)</div><p/>So far Mr. Draper had had the best of the talk. Harry only longed
himself to be rid of the engagement from which his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) aunt wanted to free
him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). His (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) foolish flame for Maria Esmond had died out long since. If she (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>)
would release him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), how thankful would he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) be! <div class="bookquote">``Come! give us your hand,
and say done!''  (<font color='red'><b>the lawyer</b></font>)</div>says the lawyer, with a knowing wink. <div class="bookquote">``Don't stand
shilly-shallying, sir. Law bless you, Mr. W., if I had married everybody
I promised, I should be like the Grand Turk, or Captain Macheath in the
play!''

 (<font color='red'><b>The lawyer</b></font>)</div><p/>The lawyer's familiarity disgusted Harry, who shrank from Draper,
scarcely knowing that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) did so. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) folded his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) dressing gown round him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>),
and stepped back from the other's proffered hand. <div class="bookquote">``Give me a little time
to think of the matter, if you please, Mr. Draper,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said, ``and have
the goodness to come to me again in an hour.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very good, sir, very good, sir!''  (<font color='red'><b>the lawyer</b></font>)</div>says the lawyer, biting his (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) lips, and,
as he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) seized up his (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) hat, turning very red. <div class="bookquote">``Most parties would not want
an hour to consider about such an offer as I make you: but I suppose my
time must be yours, and I'll come again, and see whether you are to
go or to stay. Good morning, sir, good morning:''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) went his (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) way,
growling curses down the stairs. <div class="bookquote">``Won't take my hand, won't he (<font color='blue'><b>Draper</b></font>)? Will
tell me in an hour's time! Hang his (<font color='blue'><b>Draper</b></font>) impudence! I'll show him (<font color='blue'><b>Draper</b></font>) what an
hour is!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Draper/Draper</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Draper went to his (<font color='blue'><b>Draper</b></font>) chambers in dudgeon then; bullied his (<font color='blue'><b>Draper</b></font>) clerks all
round, sent off a messenger to the Baroness, to say that he (<font color='blue'><b>Draper</b></font>) had
waited on the young gentleman, who had demanded a little time for
consideration, which was for form's sake, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Draper</b></font>) had no doubt; the lawyer
then saw clients, transacted business, went out to his (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) dinner in the
most leisurely manner; and then finally turned his (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) steps towards the
neighbouring Cursitor Street. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Draper</b></font>)'ll be at home when I call, the haughty
beast!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Draper/Draper</b></font>)</div>says Draper, with a sneer. <div class="bookquote">``The Fortunate Youth in his (<font color='blue'><b>Draper</b></font>) room?''
 (<font color='red'><b>the lawyer</b></font>)</div>the lawyer asked of the sheriff's officer's aide-de-camp who came to
open the double doors.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Warrington is in his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) apartment,''  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>said the gentleman, <div class="bookquote">``but--''  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>and
here the gentleman winked at Mr. Draper, and laid his (<font color='blue'><b>Draper</b></font>) hand on his (<font color='blue'><b>Draper</b></font>) nose.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But what, Mr. Paddy from Cork?''  (<font color='red'><b>the lawyer</b></font>)</div>said the lawyer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My name is Costigan; me familee is noble, and me neetive place is the
Irish methrawpolis, Mr. Six-and-eightpence!''  (<font color='red'><b>the janitor</b></font>)</div>said the janitor, scowling
at Draper. A rich odour of spirituous liquors filled the little space
between the double doors where he (<font color='blue'><b>Draper</b></font>) held the attorney in conversation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Confound you, sir, let me pass!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Draper/Draper</b></font>)</div>bawled out Mr. Draper.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can hear you perfectly well, Six-and-eightpence, except your h's,
which you dthrop out of your conversation. I'll thank ye not to call
neems, me good friend, or me fingers and your nose will have to make an
intimate hic-quaintance. Walk in, sir! Be polite for the future to your
shupariors in birth and manners, though they may be your infariors in
temporary station. Confound the kay! Walk in, sir, I say!--Madam, I have
the honour of saluting ye most respectfully!''

 (<font color='red'><b>A lady</b></font>)</div><p/>A lady with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) face covered with a capuchin, and further hidden by her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
handkerchief, uttered a little exclamation as of alarm as she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) came down
the stairs at this instant and hurried past the lawyer. He (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) was pressing
forward to look at her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)--for Mr. Draper was very cavalier in his (<font color='blue'><b>Draper</b></font>) manners
to women--but the bailiff's follower thrust his (<font color='blue'><b>follower</b></font>) leg between Draper and
the retreating lady, crying, <div class="bookquote">``Keep your own distance, if you plaise!
This way, madam! I at once recognised your ladysh--''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>Here he (<font color='blue'><b>Draper</b></font>) closed
the door on Draper's nose, and left that attorney to find his (<font color='blue'><b>attorney</b></font>) own way to
his (<font color='blue'><b>attorney</b></font>) client upstairs.

<p/>At six o’clock that evening the old Baroness de Bernstein was pacing up
and down her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) drawing-crutch, and for ever running to the window when the
noise of a coach was heard passing in Clarges Street. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had delayed
her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) dinner from hour to hour: she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) who scolded so fiercely, on ordinary
occasions, if her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) cook was five minutes after his (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>) time. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had ordered
two covers to be laid, plate to be set out, and some extra dishes to be
prepared as if for a little fete. Four--five o’clock passed, and at six
she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) looked from the window, and a coach actually stopped at her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) door.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Draper''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was announced, and entered bowing profoundly.

<p/>The old lady trembled on her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) stick. <div class="bookquote">``Where is the boy?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said
quickly. <div class="bookquote">``I told you to bring him (<font color='blue'><b>Draper</b></font>), sir! How dare you come without him (<font color='blue'><b>Draper</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is not my fault, madam, that Mr. Warrington refuses to come.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Draper/Draper</b></font>)</div>And
Draper gave his (<font color='blue'><b>Draper</b></font>) version of the interview which had just taken place
between himself and the young Virginian.




<p/>CHAPTER XLVIII. An Apparition


<p/>Going off in his (<font color='blue'><b>Virginian</b></font>) wrath from his (<font color='blue'><b>Virginian</b></font>) morning's conversation with Harry,
Mr. Draper thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Draper</b></font>) heard the young prisoner speak behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Draper</b></font>); and,
indeed, Harry had risen, and uttered a half-exclamation to call the
lawyer back. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was proud, and the other offended: Harry checked
words, and Draper did not choose to stop. It wound Harry's pride to be
obliged to humble himself before the lawyer, and to have to yield from
mere lack and desire of money. <div class="bookquote">``An hour hence will do as well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>thought
Harry, and lapsed sulkily on to the bed again. No, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) did not care
for Maria Esmond! No: he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was ashamed of the way in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had been
entrapped into that engagement. A wily and experienced woman, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had
cheated his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) boyish ardour. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had taken unfair advantage of him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), as her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
brother had at play. They were his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) own flesh and blood, and they ought
to have spared him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). Instead, one and the other had made a prey of
him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), and had used him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) for their selfish ends. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) thought how they had
betrayed the rights of hospitality: how they had made a victim of the
young kinsman who came confiding within their gates. His (<font color='blue'><b>kinsman</b></font>) heart was sore
wounded: his (<font color='blue'><b>kinsman</b></font>) head sank back on his (<font color='blue'><b>kinsman</b></font>) pillow: bitter tears wetted it.
<div class="bookquote">``Had they come to Virginia,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>kinsman</b></font>) thought, <div class="bookquote">``I had given them a different
welcome!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>kinsman</b></font>) was roused from this mood of despondency by Gumbo's grinning face at
his (<font color='blue'><b>kinsman</b></font>) door, who said a lady was come to see Master Harry, and behind the
lad came the lady in the capuchin, of whom we have just made mention.
Harry sat up, pale and haggard, on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) bed. The lady, with a sob, and
almost ere the servant-man withdrew, ran towards the young prisoner,
put her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) arms round his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) neck with real emotion and a maternal tenderness,
sobbed over his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) pale cheek and kissed it in the midst of plentiful
tears, and cried out--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, my Harry! Did I ever, ever think to see thee here?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the midst</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) started back, scared as it seemed at her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) presence, but she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) sank down
at the bedside, and seized his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) feverish hand, and embraced his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) knees.
She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had a real regard and tenderness for him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>). The wretched place in
which she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) found him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>), his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) wretched look, filled her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) heart with a sincere
love and pity.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I--I thought none of you would come!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>said poor Harry, with a groan.

<p/>More tears, more kisses of the hot young hand, more clasps and pressure
with hers, were the lady's reply for a moment or two.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, my dear! my dear! I cannot bear to think of thee in misery,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
sobbed out.

<p/>Hardened though it might be, that heart was not all marble--that dreary
life not all desert. Harry's mother could not have been fonder, nor her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
tones more tender than those of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) kinswoman now kneeling at his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) feet.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Some of the debts, I fear, were owing to my extravagance!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said
-LRB-and this was true-RRB-. <div class="bookquote">``You bought trinkets and jewels in order to give me
pleasure. Oh, how I hate them now! I little thought I ever could! I have
brought them all with me, and more trinkets--here! and here! and all the
money I have in the world!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) poured brooches, rings, a watch, and a score or so of guineas
into Harry's lap. The sight of which strangely agitated and immensely
touched the young man.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dearest, kindest cousin!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sobbed out.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lips found no more words to utter, but yet, no doubt they served to
express his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) gratitude, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) affection, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) emotion.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) became quite gay presently, and smiled as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) put away some of the
trinkets, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) presents to Maria, and told her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) into what danger he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had
fallen by selling other goods which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had purchased on credit; and how
a lawyer had insulted him (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) just now upon this very point. He (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) would
not have his (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) dear Maria's money--he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) had enough, quite enough for the
present: but he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) valued her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) twenty guineas as much as if they had been
twenty thousand. He (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) would never forget her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) love and kindness: no, by
all that was sacred he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) would not! His (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) mother should know of all her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
goodness. It had had cheered him (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) was just on the point of
breaking down under his (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) disgrace and misery. Might Heaven bless her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) for
it! There is no need to pursue beyond this, the cousins' conversation.
The dark day seemed brighter to Harry after Maria's visit: the
imprisonment not so hard to bear. The world was not all selfish and
cold. Here was a fond creature who really and truly loved him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). Even
Castlewood was not so bad as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had thought. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had expressed the
deepest grief at not being able to assist his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) kinsman. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was hopelessly
in debt. Every shilling he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had won from Harry he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had lost on the next
day to others. Anything that lay in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) power he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) would do. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) would come
soon and see Mr. Warrington: he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was in waiting to-day, and as much
a prisoner as Harry himself. So the pair talked on cheerfully and
affectionately until the darkness began to close in, when Maria, with a
sigh, bade Harry farewell.

<p/>The door scarcely closed upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>), when it opened to admit Draper.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your humble servant, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>the attorney</b></font>)</div>says the attorney. His (<font color='blue'><b>attorney</b></font>) voice jarred upon
Harry's ear, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) presence offended the young man.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I had expected you some hours ago, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) curtly said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A lawyer's time is not always his (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) own, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Draper/Draper</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Draper, who had
just been in consultation with a bottle of port at the Grecian. <div class="bookquote">``Never
mind, I'm at your orders now. Presume it's all right, Mr. Warrington.
Packed your trunk? Why, now there you are in your bedgown still. Let me
go down and settle whilst you call in your black man and titivate a bit.
I've a coach at the door, and we'll be off and dine with the old lady.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you going to dine with the Baroness de Bernstein, pray?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not me--no such honour. Had my dinner already. It's you are a-going to
dine with your aunt, I suppose?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Draper, you suppose a great deal more than you know,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>says Mr.
Warrington, looking very fierce and tall, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) folds his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) brocade
dressing-gown round him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Great goodness, sir, what do you mean?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Draper/Draper</b></font>)</div>asks Draper.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I mean, sir, that I have considered, and, that having given my word to
a faithful and honourable lady, it does not become me to withdraw it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Confound it, sir!''  (<font color='red'><b>the lawyer</b></font>)</div>shrieks the lawyer, <div class="bookquote">``I tell you she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) has lost the
paper. There's nothing to bind you--nothing. Why she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)'s old enough to
be--''

 (<font color='red'><b>the lawyer</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Enough, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Warrington, with a stamp of his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) foot. <div class="bookquote">``You
seem to think you are talking to some other pettifogger. I take it, Mr.
Draper, you are not accustomed to have dealings with men of honour.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pettifogger, indeed!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Draper/Draper</b></font>)</div>cries Draper in a fury. <div class="bookquote">``Men of honour, indeed!
I'd have you to know, Mr. Warrington, that I'm as good a man of honour
as you. I don't know so many gamblers and horse-jockeys, perhaps. I
haven't gambled away my patrimony, and lived as if I was a nobleman
on two hundred a year. I haven't bought watches on credit, and
pawned--touch me if you dare, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lawyer</b></font>)</div>and the lawyer sprang to the door.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That is the way out, sir. You can't go through the window, because it
is barred,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Warrington.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And the answer I take to my client is No, then!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Draper/Draper</b></font>)</div>screamed out Draper.

<p/>Harry stepped forward, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) two hands clenched. <div class="bookquote">``If you utter
another word,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I'll--''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>The door was shut rapidly--the
sentence was never finished, and Draper went away furious to Madame de
Bernstein, from whom, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Draper</b></font>) gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Draper</b></font>) the best version of his (<font color='blue'><b>Draper</b></font>) story,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Draper</b></font>) got still fiercer language than he (<font color='blue'><b>Draper</b></font>) had received from Mr. Warrington
himself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What? Shall she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) trust me, and I desert her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>says Harry, stalking up
and down his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) room in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) flowing, rustling brocade. <div class="bookquote">``Dear, faithful,
generous woman! If I lie in prison for years, I'll be true to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).''


 (<font color='red'><b>lawyer</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Draper</b></font>) lawyer dismissed after a stormy interview, the desolate old woman
was fain to sit down to the meal which she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had hoped to share with
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) nephew. The chair was before her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) which he (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) was to have filled, the
glasses shining by the silver. One dish after another was laid before
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) by the silent major-domo, and tasted and pushed away. The man
pressed his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mistress at last. <div class="bookquote">``It is eight o’clock,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``You have
had nothing all day. It is good for you to eat.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) could not eat. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
would have her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) coffee. Let Case go get her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) coffee. The lacqueys bore
the dishes off the table, leaving their mistress sitting at it before
the vacant chair.

<p/>Presently the old servant re-entered the room without his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) lady's coffee
and with a strange scared face, and said, <div class="bookquote">``Mr. WARRINGTON!''

 (<font color='red'><b>lady</b></font>)</div><p/>The old woman uttered an exclamation, got up from her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) armchair, but sank
back in it trembling very much. <div class="bookquote">``So you are come, sir, are you?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
said, with a fond shaking voice. <div class="bookquote">``Bring back the--Ah!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>here she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
screamed, <div class="bookquote">``Gracious God, who is it?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) eyes stared wildly: her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) white
face looked ghastly through her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) rouge. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) clung to the arms of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
chair for support, as the visitor approached her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).

<p/>A gentleman whose face and figure exactly resembled Harry Warrington and
whose voice, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) spoke, had tones strangely similar, had followed
the servant into the room. He (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) bowed towards the Baroness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You expected my brother, madam?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) said <div class="bookquote">``I am but now arrived in
London. I went to his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) house. I met his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) servant at your door, who was
bearing this letter for you. I thought I would bring it to your ladyship
before going to him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>),'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--and the stranger laid down a letter before Madam
Bernstein.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you'' (<font color='red'><b>Baroness/Baroness Bernstein/Bernstein</b></font>)</div>--gasped out the Baroness--<div class="bookquote">``are you my nephew, that we supposed
was--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Baroness/Baroness Bernstein/Bernstein</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Was killed--and is alive! I am George Warrington, madam and I ask his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>)
kinsfolk what have you done with my brother?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Baroness/Baroness Bernstein/Bernstein</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Look, George!''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>said the bewildered old lady <div class="bookquote">``I expected him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) here
to-night--that chair was set for him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)--I have been waiting for him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>), sir,
till now--till I am quite faint--I don't like--I don't like being alone.
Do stay an sup with me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pardon me, madam. Please God, my supper will be with Harry tonight!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Bring him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) back. Bring him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) back here on any conditions! It is but five
hundred pounds! Here is the money, sir, if you need it!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have no want, madam. I have money with me that can't be better
employed than in my brother's service.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you will bring him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) to me, sir! Say you will bring him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) to me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Warrington made a very stately bow for answer, and quitted the room,
passing by the amazed domestics, and calling with an air of authority to
Gumbo to follow him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>).

<p/>Had Mr. Harry received no letters from home? Master Harry had not
opened all his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) letters the last day or two. Had he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) received no letter
announcing his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) brother's escape from the French settlements and return
to Virginia? Oh no! No such letter had come, else Master Harry certainly
tell Gumbo. Quick, horses! Quick by Strand to Temple Bar! Here is the
house of Captivity and the Deliverer come to the rescue!




<p/>CHAPTER XLIX. Friends in Need


<p/>Quick, hackneycoach steeds, and bear George Warrington through Strand
and Fleet Street to his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) imprisoned brother's rescue! Any one who
remembers Hogarth's picture of a London hackneycoach and a London street
road at that period, may fancy how weary the quick time was, and how
long seemed the journey:--scarce any lights, save those carried by
link-boys; badly hung coaches; bad pavements; great holes in the road,
and vast quagmires of winter mud. That drive from Piccadilly to Fleet
Street seemed almost as long to our young man, as the journey from
Marlborough to London which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had performed in the morning.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had written to Harry, announcing his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) arrival at Bristol. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had
previously written to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) brother, giving the great news of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
existence and his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) return from captivity. There was war between England
and France at that time; the French privateers were for ever on the
look-out for British merchant-ships, and seized them often within sight
of port. The letter bearing the intelligence of George's restoration
must have been on board one of the many American ships of which the
French took possession. The letter telling of George's arrival in
England was never opened by poor Harry; it was lying at the latter's
apartments, which it reached on the third morning after Harry's
captivity, when the angry Mr. Ruff had refused to give up any single
item more of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ruff</b></font>) lodger's property.

<p/>To these apartments George first went on his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) arrival in London,
and asked for his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) brother. Scared at the likeness between them, the
maid-servant who opened the door screamed, and ran back to her (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) mistress.
The mistress not liking to tell the truth, or to own that poor Harry was
actually a prisoner at her (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) husband's suit, said Mr. Warrington had left
his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) lodgings; she (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) did not know where Mr. Warrington was. George knew
that Clarges Street was close to Bond Street. Often and often had he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
looked over the London map. Aunt Bernstein would tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>) where Harry
was. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) might be with her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) at that very moment. George had read in
Harry's letters to Virginia about Aunt Bernstein's kindness to Harry.
Even Madam Esmond was softened by it -LRB-and especially touched by a letter
which the Baroness wrote--the letter which caused George to pack off
post-haste for Europe, indeed-RRB-. She (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) heartily hoped and trusted that
Madam Beatrix had found occasion to repent of her (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrix</b></font>) former bad ways. It
was time, indeed, at her (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrix</b></font>) age; and Heaven knows that she (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrix</b></font>) had plenty
to repent of! I have known a harmless, good old soul of eighty, still
bepommelled and stoned by irreproachable ladies of the straitest sect of
the Pharisees, for a little slip which occurred long before the present
century was born, or she (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrix</b></font>) herself was twenty years old. Rachel Esmond
never mentioned her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) eldest daughter: Madam Esmond Warrington never
mentioned her (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) sister. No. In spite of the order for remission of the
sentence--in spite of the handwriting on the floor of the Temple--there
is a crime which some folks never will pardon, and regarding which
female virtue, especially, is inexorable.

<p/>I suppose the Virginians' agent at Bristol had told George fearful
stories of his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) brother's doings. Gumbo, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) met at his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) aunt's door,
as soon as the lad recovered from his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) terror at the sudden reappearance
of the master whom he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) supposed dead, had leisure to stammer out a word
or two respecting his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) young master's whereabouts, and present pitiable
condition; and hence Mr. George's sternness of demeanour when he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
presented himself to the old lady. It seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) a matter of course
that his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) brother in difficulty should be rescued by his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) relations. Oh,
George, how little you know about London and London ways! Whenever you
take your walks abroad how many poor you meet--if a philanthropist were
for rescuing all of them, not all the wealth of all the provinces of
America would suffice him (<font color='blue'><b>philanthropist</b></font>)!

<p/>But the feeling and agitation displayed by the old lady touched her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
nephew's heart when, jolting through the dark streets towards the
house of his (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) brother's captivity, George came to think of his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) aunt's
behaviour. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>) does feel my poor Harry's misfortune,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) thought to
himself, <div class="bookquote">``I have been too hasty in judging her (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Again and again, in the
course of his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) life, Mr. George had to rebuke himself with the same crime
of being too hasty. How many of us have not? And, alas, the mischief
done, there's no repentance will mend it. Quick, coachman! We are almost
as slow as you are in getting from Clarges Street to the Temple. Poor
Gumbo knows the way to the bailiff's house well enough. Again the bell
is set ringing. The first door is opened to George and his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) negro; then
that first door is locked warily upon them, and they find themselves
in a little passage with a little Jewish janitor; then a second door is
unlocked, and they enter into the house. The Jewish janitor stares, as
by his (<font color='blue'><b>janitor</b></font>) flaring tallow-torch he (<font color='blue'><b>janitor</b></font>) sees a second Mr. Warrington before
him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>). Come to see that gentleman? Yes. But wait a moment. This is Mr.
Warrington's brother from America. Gumbo must go and prepare his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) master
first. Step into this room. There's a gentleman already there about
Mr. W.'s business -LRB-the porter says-RRB-, and another upstairs with him (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) now.
There's no end of people have been about him (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>).

<p/>The room into which George was introduced was a small apartment which
went by the name of Mr. Amos's office, and where, by a guttering candle,
and talking to the bailiff, sat a stout gentleman in a cloak and a laced
hat. The young porter carried his (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) candle, too, preceding Mr. George, so
there was a sufficiency of light in the apartment.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We are not angry any more, Harry!''  (<font color='red'><b>the stout gentleman</b></font>)</div>says the stout gentleman, in a
cheery voice, getting up and advancing with an outstretched hand to
the new-comer. <div class="bookquote">``Thank God, my boy! Mr. Amos here says, there will be
no difficulty about James and me being your bail, and we will do your
business by breakfast-time in the morning. Why... Angels and ministers
of grace! who are you?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) started back as the other had hold of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
hand.

<p/>But the stranger grasped it only the more strongly. <div class="bookquote">``God bless you,
sir!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I know who you are. You must be Colonel Lambert, of
whose kindness to him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) my poor Harry wrote. And I am the brother whom you
have heard of, sir; and who was left for dead in Mr. Braddock's action;
and came to life again after eighteen months amongst the French;
and live to thank God and thank you for your kindness to my Harry,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>continued the lad with a faltering voice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``James! James! Here is news!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lambert</b></font>)</div>cries Mr. Lambert to a gentleman in red,
who now entered the room. <div class="bookquote">``Here are the dead come alive! Here is Harry
Scapegrace's brother come back, and with his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) scalp on his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) head, too!''
 (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>-LRB-George had taken his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) hat off, and was standing by the light.-RRB- <div class="bookquote">``This is
my brother-bail, Mr. Warrington! This is Lieutenant-Colonel James
Wolfe, at your service. You must know there has been a little difference
between Harry and me, Mr. George. He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) is pacified, is he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>), James?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) is full of gratitude,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wolfe/Wolfe</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Wolfe, after making his (<font color='blue'><b>Wolfe</b></font>) bow to Mr.
Warrington.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Harry wrote home about Mr. Wolfe, too, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the young man, <div class="bookquote">``and I
hope my brother's friends will be so kind as to be mine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had none other but us, Mr. Warrington. Poor Harry's fine
folks have been too fine for him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), and have ended by landing him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, your honours, I have done my best to make the young gentleman
comfortable; and, knowing your honour before, when you came to bail
Captain Watkins, and that your security is perfectly good,--if your
honour wishes, the young gentleman can go out this very night, and I
will make it all right with the lawyer in the morning,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>says Harry's
landlord, who knew the rank and respectability of the two gentlemen who
had come to offer bail for his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) young prisoner.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The debt is five hundred and odd pounds, I think?''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Warrington.
<div class="bookquote">``With a hundred thanks to these gentlemen, I can pay the amount at this
moment into the officers' hands, taking the usual acknowledgment and
caution. But I can never forget, gentlemen, that you helped my brother
at his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) need, and, for doing so, I say thank you, and God bless you, in
my mother's name and mine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>master</b></font>)</div><p/>Gumbo had, meanwhile, gone upstairs to his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) master's apartment, where
Harry would probably have scolded the negro for returning that night,
but that the young gentleman was very much soothed and touched by the
conversation he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had had with the friend who had just left him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was
sitting over his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) pipe of Virginia in a sad mood -LRB-for, somehow, even
Maria's goodness and affection, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) had just exhibited them, had not
altogether consoled him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>); and he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had thought, with a little dismay, of
certain consequences to which that very kindness and fidelity bound
him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)-RRB-, when Mr. Wolfe's homely features and eager outstretched hand came
to cheer the prisoner, and he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) heard how Mr. Lambert was below, and
the errand upon which the two officers had come. In spite of himself,
Lambert would be kind to him (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>). In spite of Harry's ill-temper, and
needless suspicion and anger, the good gentleman was determined to help
him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) might--to help him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) even against Mr. Wolfe's own advice, as the
latter frankly told Harry, <div class="bookquote">``For you were wrong, Mr. Warrington,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>said
the Colonel, <div class="bookquote">``and you wouldn't be set right; and you, a young man, used
hard words and unkind behaviour to your senior, and what is more, one of
the best gentlemen who walks God's earth. You see, sir, what his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) answer
hath been to your wayward temper. You will bear with a friend who speaks
frankly with you? Martin Lambert hath acted in this as he (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) always doth,
as the best Christian, the best friend, the most kind and generous of
men. Nay, if you want another proof of his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) goodness, here it is: He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) has
converted me, who, as I don't care to disguise, was angry with you for
your treatment of him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>), and has absolutely brought me down here to be
your bail. Let us both cry Peccavimus! Harry, and shake our friend by
the hand! He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) is sitting in the room below. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) would not come here till
he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) knew how you would receive him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Colonel man words behaviour</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) is a good man!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>groaned out Harry. <div class="bookquote">``I was very angry and
wild at the time when he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) and I met last, Colonel Wolfe. Nay, perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Wolfe</b></font>)
was right in sending back those trinkets, hurt as I was at his (<font color='blue'><b>Wolfe</b></font>) doing so.
Go down to him (<font color='blue'><b>Wolfe</b></font>), will you be so kind, sir? and tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Wolfe</b></font>) I am sorry, and
ask his (<font color='blue'><b>Wolfe</b></font>) pardon, and--and, God bless him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) for his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) generous behaviour.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>And here the young gentleman turned his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) head away, and rubbed his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) hand
across his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) all this thyself, Harry!''  (<font color='red'><b>the Colonel</b></font>)</div>cries the Colonel, taking the young
fellow's hand. <div class="bookquote">``No deputy will ever say it half so well. Come with me
now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You go first, and I'll--I'll follow,--on my word I will. See! I am in
my morning-gown! I will but put on a coat and come to him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). Give him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) my
message first. Just--just prepare him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) for me!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>says poor Harry, who
knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) must do it, but yet did not much like that process of eating of
humble-pie.

<p/>Wolfe went out smiling--understanding the lad's scruples well enough,
perhaps. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Wolfe</b></font>) opened the door, Mr. Gumbo entered it; almost forgetting
to bow to the gentleman, profusely courteous as he (<font color='blue'><b>Gumbo</b></font>) was on ordinary
occasions,--his (<font color='blue'><b>Gumbo</b></font>) eyes glaring round, his (<font color='blue'><b>Gumbo</b></font>) great mouth grinning--himself in
a state of such high excitement and delight that his (<font color='blue'><b>Gumbo</b></font>) master remarked his (<font color='blue'><b>Gumbo</b></font>)
condition.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What, Gum? What has happened to thee? Hast thou got a new sweetheart?''

 (<font color='red'><b>no sweetheart master</b></font>)</div><p/>No, Gum had not got no new sweetheart, master.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Give me my coat. What has brought thee back?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Gum grinned prodigiously. <div class="bookquote">``I have seen a ghost, mas'r!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A ghost! and whose, and where?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Whar? Saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) at Madame Bernstein's house. Come with him (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>) here in
the coach! He (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>) downstairs now with Colonel Lambert!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Whilst Gumbo is
speaking, as he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) is putting on his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) master's coat, his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) eyes are rolling,
his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) head is wagging, his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) hands are trembling, his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) lips are grinning.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ghost--what ghost?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>says Harry, in a strange agitation. Is
anybody--is--my mother come?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, sir; no, Master Harry!''  (<font color='red'><b>master</b></font>)</div>Gumbo's head rolls nearly off its violent
convolutions, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) master, looking oddly at him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), flings the door
open, and goes rapidly down the stair.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) is at the foot of it, just as a voice within the little office, of
which the door is open, is saying, <div class="bookquote">``and for doing so, I say thank you,
and God bless you, in my mother's name and mine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Whose voice is that?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>calls out Harry Warrington, with a strange cry in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) own voice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's the ghost's, mas'r!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>says Gumbo, from behind; and Harry runs
forward to the room,--where, if you please, we will pause a little
minute before we enter. The two gentlemen who were there, turned their
heads away. The lost was found again. The dead was alive. The
prodigal was on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) brother's heart,--his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) own full of love, gratitude,
repentance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come away, James! I think we are not wanted any more here,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Colonel</b></font>)</div>says the
Colonel. <div class="bookquote">``Good-night, boys. Some ladies in Hill Street won't be able to
sleep for this strange news. Or will you go home and sup with `em, and
tell them the story?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the boys</b></font>)</div><p/>No, with many thanks, the boys would not go and sup to-night. They had
stories of their own to tell. <div class="bookquote">``Quick, Gumbo, with the trunks! Good-bye,
Mr. Amos!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>Harry felt almost unhappy when he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) went away.




<p/>CHAPTER L. Contains a Great deal of the Finest Morality


<p/>When first we had the honour to be presented to Sir Miles Warrington at
the King's drawing-room, in St. James's Palace, I confess that I, for
one--looking at his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) jolly round face, his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) broad round waistcoat, his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>)
hearty country manner,--expected that I had lighted upon a most eligible
and agreeable acquaintance at last, and was about to become intimate
with that noblest specimen of the human race, the bepraised of songs and
men, the good old English country gentleman. In fact, to be a good old
country gentleman is to hold a position nearest the gods, and at the
summit of earthly felicity. To have a large unencumbered rent-roll, and
the rents regularly paid by adoring farmers, who bless their stars at
having such a landlord as his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) honour; to have no tenant holding back
with his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) money, excepting just one, perhaps, who does so in order to
give occasion to Good Old Country Gentleman to show his (<font color='blue'><b>Gentleman</b></font>) sublime charity
and universal benevolence of soul; to hunt three days a week, love the
sport of all things, and have perfect good health and good appetite in
consequence; to have not only good appetite, but a good dinner; to sit
down at church in the midst of a chorus of blessings from the villagers,
the first man in the parish, the benefactor of the parish, with a
consciousness of consummate desert, saying, <div class="bookquote">``Have mercy upon us,
miserable sinners,''  (<font color='red'><b>the benefactor</b></font>)</div>to be sure, but only for form's sake, because the
words are written in the book, and to give other folks an example--a G.
O. C. G. a miserable sinner! So healthy, so wealthy, so jolly, so much
respected by the vicar, so much honoured by the tenants, so much beloved
and admired by his (<font color='blue'><b>vicar</b></font>) family, amongst whom his (<font color='blue'><b>vicar</b></font>) story of grouse in the
gunroom causes laughter from generation to generation;--this perfect
being a miserable sinner! Allons donc! Give any man good health and
temper, five thousand a year, the adoration of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) parish, and the love
and worship of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) family, and I'll defy you to make him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) so heartily
dissatisfied with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) spiritual condition as to set himself down a
miserable anything. If you were a Royal Highness, and went to church
in the most perfect health and comfort, the parson waiting to begin the
service until your R. H. came in, would you believe yourself to be a
miserable, etc.? You might when racked with gout, in solitude, the fear
of death before your eyes, the doctor having cut off your bottle of
claret, and ordered arrowroot and a little sherry,--you might then be
humiliated, and acknowledge your own shortcomings, and the vanity of
things in general; but, in high health, sunshine, spirits, that word
miserable is only a form. You can't think in your heart that you are
to be pitied much for the present. If you are to be miserable, what is
Colin Ploughman, with the ague, seven children, two pounds a year rent
to pay for his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) cottage, and eight shillings a week? No: a healthy, rich,
jolly, country gentleman, if miserable, has a very supportable misery:
if a sinner, has very few people to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>sinner</b></font>) so.

<p/>It may be he (<font color='blue'><b>sinner</b></font>) becomes somewhat selfish; but at least he (<font color='blue'><b>sinner</b></font>) is satisfied with
himself. Except my lord at the castle, there is nobody for miles and
miles round so good or so great. His (<font color='blue'><b>sinner</b></font>) admirable wife ministers to him (<font color='blue'><b>sinner</b></font>),
and to the whole parish, indeed: his (<font color='blue'><b>sinner</b></font>) children bow before him (<font color='blue'><b>sinner</b></font>): the vicar
of the parish reverences him (<font color='blue'><b>sinner</b></font>): he (<font color='blue'><b>sinner</b></font>) is respected at quarter-sessions: he (<font color='blue'><b>sinner</b></font>)
causes poachers to tremble: off go all hats before him (<font color='blue'><b>sinner</b></font>) at market: and
round about his (<font color='blue'><b>sinner</b></font>) great coach, in which his (<font color='blue'><b>sinner</b></font>) spotless daughters and sublime
lady sit, all the country-town tradesmen cringe, bareheaded, and the
farmeers' women drop innumerable curtseys. From their cushions in the
great coach the ladies look down beneficently, and smile on the poorer
folk. They buy a yard of ribbon with affability; they condescend to
purchase an ounce of salts, or a packet of flower-seeds: they deign to
cheapen a goose: their drive is like a royal progress; a happy people
is supposed to press round them and bless them. Tradesmen bow, farmers'
wives bob, town-boys, waving their ragged hats, cheer the red-faced
coachman as he (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) drives the fat bays, and cry, <div class="bookquote">``Sir Miles for ever! Throw
us a halfpenny, my lady!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>But suppose the market-woman should hide her (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) fat goose when Sir Miles's
coach comes, out of terror lest my lady, spying the bird, should insist
on purchasing it a bargain? Suppose no coppers ever were known to come
out of the royal coach window? Suppose Sir Miles regaled his (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) tenants
with notoriously small beer, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) poor with especially thin broth?
This may be our fine old English gentleman's way. There have been not a
few fine English gentlemen and ladies of this sort; who patronised the
poor without ever relieving them, who called out <div class="bookquote">``Amen!''  (<font color='red'><b>ladies</b></font>)</div>at church
as loud as the clerk; who went through all the forms of piety, and
discharged all the etiquette of old English gentlemanhood; who bought
virtue a bargain, as it were, and had no doubt they were honouring
her (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>) by the purchase. Poor Harry in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) distress asked help from his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
relations: his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) aunt sent him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) a tract and her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) blessing; his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) uncle had
business out of town, and could not, of course, answer the poor boy's
petition. How much of this behaviour goes on daily in respectable life,
think you? You can fancy Lord and Lady Macbeth concocting a murder,
and coming together with some little awkwardness, perhaps, when the
transaction was done and over; but my Lord and Lady Skinflint, when they
consult in their bedroom about giving their luckless nephew a helping
hand, and determine to refuse, and go down to family prayers, and meet
their children and domestics, and discourse virtuously before them, and
then remain together, and talk nose to nose,--what can they think of one
another? and of the poor kinsman fallen among the thieves, and groaning
for help unheeded? How can they go on with those virtuous airs? How can
they dare look each other in the face?

<p/>Dare? Do you suppose they think they have done wrong? Do you suppose
Skinflint is tortured with remorse at the idea of the distress which
called to him (<font color='blue'><b>kinsman</b></font>) in vain, and of the hunger which he (<font color='blue'><b>kinsman</b></font>) sent empty away? Not
he (<font color='blue'><b>kinsman</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>kinsman</b></font>) is indignant with Prodigal for being a fool: he (<font color='blue'><b>kinsman</b></font>) is not ashamed
of himself for being a curmudgeon. What? a young man with such
opportunities throw them away? A fortune spent amongst gamblers and
spendthrifts? Horrible, horrible! Take warning, my child, by this
unfortunate young man's behaviour, and see the consequences of
extravagance. According to the great and always Established Church of
the Pharisees, here is an admirable opportunity for a moral discourse,
and an assertion of virtue. <div class="bookquote">``And to think of his (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) deceiving us so!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady</b></font>)</div>cries
out Lady Warrington.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very sad, very sad, my dear!''  (<font color='red'><b>Sir Miles</b></font>)</div>says Sir Miles, wagging his (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) head.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``To think of so much extravagance in one so young!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Warrington</b></font>)</div>cries Lady
Warrington. <div class="bookquote">``Cards, bets, feasts at taverns of the most wicked
profusion, carriage and riding horses, the company of the wealthy and
profligate of his (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) own sex, and, I fear, of the most iniquitous persons
of ours.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hush, my Lady Warrington!''  (<font color='red'><b>husband</b></font>)</div>cries her (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) husband, glancing towards the
spotless Dora and Flora, who held down their blushing heads, at the
mention of the last naughty persons.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No wonder my poor children hide their faces!''  (<font color='red'><b>mamma</b></font>)</div>mamma continues. <div class="bookquote">``My
dears, I wish even the existence of such creatures could be kept from
you!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They can't go to an opera, or the park, without seeing `em, to be
sure,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sir Miles</b></font>)</div>says Sir Miles.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``To think we should have introduced such a young serpent into the
bosom of our family! and have left him (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) in the company of that guileless
darling!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and she (<font color='blue'><b>Flora</b></font>) points to Master Miles.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who's a serpent, mamma?''  (<font color='red'><b>youth</b></font>)</div>inquires that youth. <div class="bookquote">``First you said cousin
Harry was bad: then he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was good: now he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) is bad again. Which is he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), Sir
Miles?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) has faults, like all of us, Miley, my dear. Your cousin has been
wild, and you must take warning by him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Was not my elder brother, who died--my naughty brother--was not he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) wild

me money, nor toys, nor rode with me, nor--why do you cry, mamma? Sure I

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Silence, sir!''  (<font color='red'><b>papa girls</b></font>)</div>cry out papa and the girls in a breath. <div class="bookquote">``Don't you know
you are never to mention that name?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know I love Harry, and I didn't love Hugh,''  (<font color='red'><b>the rebel</b></font>)</div>says the sturdy little
rebel. <div class="bookquote">``And if cousin Harry is in prison, I'll give him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) my half-guinea

Snowball and Sweetlips at home--and--and, yes, my custard after dinner.''
 (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div>This was in reply to a hint of sister Dora. <div class="bookquote">``But I'd give him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) some of
it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miles</b></font>)</div>continues Miles, after a pause.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Shut thy mouth with it, child, and then go about thy business,''  (<font color='red'><b>papa</b></font>)</div>says
papa, amused. Sir Miles Warrington had a considerable fund of easy
humour.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who would have thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) should ever be so wild?''  (<font color='red'><b>mamma</b></font>)</div>mamma goes on.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay. Youth is the season for wild oats, my dear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That we should be so misled in him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>the girls</b></font>)</div>sighed the girls.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) should kiss us both!''  (<font color='red'><b>papa</b></font>)</div>cries papa.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sir Miles Warrington, I have no patience with that sort of vulgarity!''
 (<font color='red'><b>the matron</b></font>)</div>says the majestic matron.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Which of you was the favourite yesterday, girls?''  (<font color='red'><b>the father</b></font>)</div>continues the father.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Favourite, indeed! I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) over and over again of my engagement
to dear Tom--I did, Dora--why do you sneer, if you please?''  (<font color='red'><b>the sister</b></font>)</div>says the
handsome sister.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, to do her (<font color='blue'><b>Dora</b></font>) justice, so did Dora too,''  (<font color='red'><b>papa</b></font>)</div>said papa.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Because Flora seemed to wish to forget her (<font color='blue'><b>Flora</b></font>) engagement with dear Tom
sometimes,''  (<font color='red'><b>the sister</b></font>)</div>remarks the sister.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I never, never, never wished to break with Tom! It's wicked of you to
say so, Dora! It is you who were for ever sneering at him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>): it is you who
are always envious because I happen--at least, because gentlemen imagine
that I am not ill-looking, and prefer me to some folks, in spite of
all their learning and wit!''  (<font color='red'><b>Flora</b></font>)</div>cries Flora, tossing her (<font color='blue'><b>Flora</b></font>) head over her (<font color='blue'><b>Flora</b></font>)
shoulder, and looking at the glass.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why are you always looking there, sister?''  (<font color='red'><b>Miles</b></font>)</div>says the artless Miles
junior. <div class="bookquote">``Sure, you must know your face well enough!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Some people look at it just as often, child, who haven't near such good
reason,''  (<font color='red'><b>papa</b></font>)</div>says papa, gallantly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you mean me, Sir Miles, I thank you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dora</b></font>)</div>cries Dora. <div class="bookquote">``My face is as
Heaven made it, and my father and mother gave it me. `Tis not my fault
if I resemble my papa's family. If my head is homely, at least I have
got some brains in it. I envious of Flora, indeed, because she (<font color='blue'><b>Flora</b></font>) has found
favour in the sight of poor Tom Claypool! I should as soon be proud of
captivating a ploughboy!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pray, miss, was your Mr. Harry, of Virginia, much wiser than Tom
Claypool? You would have had him (<font color='blue'><b>Claypool</b></font>) for the asking!''  (<font color='red'><b>Flora</b></font>)</div>exclaims Flora.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And so would you, miss, and have dropped Tom Claypool into the sea!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dora</b></font>)</div>cries Dora.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wouldn't.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You would.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wouldn't;'' (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div>--and da capo goes the conversation--the shuttlecock of
wrath being briskly battled from one sister to another.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, my children! Is this the way you dwell together in unity?''  (<font color='red'><b>parent</b></font>)</div>exclaims
their excellent female parent, laying down her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) embroidery. <div class="bookquote">``What an
example you set to this Innocent!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Like to see `em fight, my lady!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>cries the Innocent, rubbing his (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) hands.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``At her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), Flora! Worry her (<font color='blue'><b>Flora</b></font>), Dora! To it again, you little rogues!''  (<font color='red'><b>papa</b></font>)</div>says
facetious papa. `Tis good sport, ain't it, Miley?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Sir Miles! Oh, my children! These disputes are unseemly. They tear
a fond mother's heart,''  (<font color='red'><b>mamma</b></font>)</div>says mamma, with majestic action, though bearing
the laceration of her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) bosom with much seeming equanimity. <div class="bookquote">``What cause
for thankfulness ought we to have that watchful parents have prevented
any idle engagements between you and your misguided cousin. If we have
been mistaken in him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>), is it not a mercy that we have found out our error
in time? If either of you had any preference for him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>), your excellent
good sense, my loves, will teach you to overcome, to eradicate, the vain
feeling. That we cherished and were kind to him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) can never be a source of
regret. `Tis a proof of our good-nature. What we have to regret, I fear,
is, that your cousin should have proved unworthy of our kindness, and,
coming away from the society of gamblers, play-actors, and the like,
should have brought contamination--pollution, I had almost said--into
this pure family!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, bother mamma's sermons!''  (<font color='red'><b>Flora</b></font>)</div>says Flora, as my lady pursues a harangue
of which we only give the commencement here, but during which papa,
whistling, gently quits the room on tiptoe, whilst the artless Miles
junior winds his (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) top and pegs it under the robes of his (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) sisters. It has
done humming, and staggered and tumbled over, and expired in its usual
tipsy manner, long ere Lady Warrington has finished her (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) sermon.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Were you listening to me, my child?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) asks, laying her (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) hand on her (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>)
darling's head.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>says he (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>), with the whipcord in his (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) mouth, and proceeding
to wind up his (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) sportive engine. <div class="bookquote">``You was a-saying that Harry was very
poor now, and that we oughtn't to help him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). That's what you was saying;
wasn't it, madam?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My poor child, thou wilt understand me better when thou art older!''
 (<font color='red'><b>mamma</b></font>)</div>says mamma, turning towards that ceiling to which her (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) eyes always have
recourse.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Get out, you little wretch!''  (<font color='red'><b>the sisters</b></font>)</div>cries one of the sisters. The artless one
has pegged his (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) top at Dora's toes, and laughs with the glee of merry
boyhood at his (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) sister's discomfiture.

<p/>But what is this? Who comes here? Why does Sir Miles return to the
drawing-room, and why does Tom Claypool, who strides after the Baronet,
wear a countenance so disturbed?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here's a pretty business, my Lady Warrington!''  (<font color='red'><b>Sir Miles</b></font>)</div>cries Sir Miles. <div class="bookquote">``Here's
a wonderful wonder of wonders, girls!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``For goodness' sake, gentlemen, what is your intelligence?''  (<font color='red'><b>the matron</b></font>)</div>asks the
virtuous matron.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The whole town's talking about it, my lady!''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom Claypool/Tom/Claypool</b></font>)</div>says Tom Claypool puffing
for breath.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tom has seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Sir Miles</b></font>)</div>continued Sir Miles.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Seen both of them, my Lady Warrington. They were at Ranelagh last
night, with a regular mob after `em. And so like, that but for their
different ribbons you would hardly have told one from the other. One was
in blue, the other in brown; but I'm certain he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) has worn both the suits
here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What suits?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What one,--what other?''  (<font color='red'><b>the girls</b></font>)</div>call the girls.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, your fortunate youth, to be sure.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Our precious Virginian, and heir to the principality!''  (<font color='red'><b>Sir Miles</b></font>)</div>says Sir Miles.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is my nephew, then, released from his (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) incarceration?''  (<font color='red'><b>ladyship</b></font>)</div>asks her (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>)

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Confound him (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>the Baronet</b></font>)</div>roars out the Baronet, with an expression which I fear
was even stronger. <div class="bookquote">``What should you think, my Lady Warrington, if this
precious nephew of mine should turn out to be an impostor; by George! no
better than an adventurer?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``An inward monitor whispered me as much!''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>cried the lady; <div class="bookquote">``but I
dashed from me the unworthy suspicion. Speak, Sir Miles, we burn with
impatience to listen to your intelligence.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll--speak, my love, when you've done,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sir Miles</b></font>)</div>says Sir Miles. <div class="bookquote">``Well, what do
you think of my gentleman, who comes into my house, dines at my table,
is treated as one of this family, kisses my--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What?''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom Claypool/Tom/Claypool</b></font>)</div>asks Tom Claypool, firing as red as his (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) waistcoat.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``--Hem! Kisses my wife's hand, and is treated in the fondest manner, by
George! What do you think of this fellow, who talks of his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) property and
his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) principality, by Jupiter!--turning out to be a beggarly SECOND SON!
A beggar, my Lady Warrington, by--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sir Miles Warrington, no violence of language before these dear ones!
I sink to the earth, confounded by this unutterable hypocrisy. And did
I entrust thee to a pretender, my blessed boy? Did I leave thee with an
impostor, my innocent one?''  (<font color='red'><b>the matron</b></font>)</div>the matron cries, fondling her (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>) son.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who's an impostor, my lady?''  (<font color='red'><b>the child</b></font>)</div>asks the child.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That confounded young scamp of a Harry Warrington!''  (<font color='red'><b>papa</b></font>)</div>bawls out papa; on
which the little Miles, after wearing a puzzled look for a moment, and
yielding to I know not what hidden emotion, bursts out crying.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) admirable mother proposes to clutch him (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) heart, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) rejects
the pure caress, bawling only the louder, and kicking frantically about
the maternal gremium, as the butler announces <div class="bookquote">``Mr. George Warrington,
Mr. Henry Warrington!''  (<font color='red'><b>the butler</b></font>)</div>Miles is dropped from his (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) mother's lap. Sir
Miles's face emulates Mr. Claypool's waistcoat. The three ladies rise
up, and make three most frigid curtseys, as our two young men enter the
room.

<p/>Little Miles runs towards them. He (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) holds out a little hand. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, Harry!
No! which is Harry? You're my Harry,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) chooses rightly this time.
<div class="bookquote">``Oh, you dear Harry! I'm so glad you are come! and they've been abusing
you so!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am come to pay my duty to my uncle,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>says the dark-haired Mr.
Warrington; <div class="bookquote">``and to thank him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) for his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) hospitalities to my brother
Henry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What, nephew George? My brother's face and eyes! Boys both, I am
delighted to see you!''  (<font color='red'><b>uncle</b></font>)</div>cries their uncle, grasping affectionately a hand
of each, as his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) honest face radiates with pleasure.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This indeed hath been a most mysterious and a most providential
resuscitation,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Warrington</b></font>)</div>says Lady Warrington. <div class="bookquote">``Only I wonder that my nephew
Henry concealed the circumstance until now,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) adds, with a sidelong
glance at both young gentlemen.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) knew it no more than your ladyship,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Warrington. The young
ladies looked at each other with downcast eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed, sir! a most singular circumstance,''  (<font color='red'><b>mamma</b></font>)</div>says mamma, with another
curtsey. <div class="bookquote">``We had heard of it, sir; and Mr. Claypool, our county
neighbour, had just brought us the intelligence, and it even now formed
the subject of my conversation with my daughters.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>cries out a little voice, <div class="bookquote">``and do you know, Harry, father and
mother said you was a--a imp--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Silence, my child! Screwby, convey Master Warrington to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) own
apartment! These, Mr. Warrington--or, I suppose I should say nephew
George--are your cousins.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Two curtseys--two cheeses are made--two hands
are held out. Mr. Esmond Warrington makes a profound low bow, which
embraces -LRB-and it is the only embrace which the gentleman offers-RRB- all
three ladies. He (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) lays his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) hat to his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) heart. He (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) says, <div class="bookquote">``It is my duty,
madam, to pay my respects to my uncle and cousins, and to thank your
ladyship for such hospitality as you have been enabled to show to my
brother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It was not much, nephew, but it was our best. Ods bobs!''  (<font color='red'><b>the Sir Miles</b></font>)</div>cries the
hearty Sir Miles, <div class="bookquote">``it was our best!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Sir Miles</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And I appreciate it, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Warrington, looking gravely round
at the family.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Give us thy hand. Not a word more,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sir Miles</b></font>)</div>says Sir Miles <div class="bookquote">``What? do you think
I'm a cannibal, and won't extend the hand of hospitality to my dear
brother's son? What say you, lads? Will you eat our mutton at three?
This is my neighbour, Tom Claypool, son to Sir Thomas Claypool, Baronet,
and my very good friend. Hey, Tom! Thou wilt be of the party, Tom? Thou
knowest our brew, hey, my boy?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sir Miles</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I know it, Sir Miles,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Humbold</b></font>)</div>replies Tom, with no peculiar expression of
rapture on his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And thou shalt taste it, my boy,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>thou shalt taste it! What is
there for dinner, my Lady Warrington? Our food is plain, but plenty,
lads--plain, but plenty!''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We cannot partake of it to-day, sir. We dine with a friend who occupies
my Lord Wrotham's house, your neighbour. Colonel Lambert--Major-General
Lambert he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) has just been made.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``With two daughters, I think--countrified-looking girls--are they not?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Flora</b></font>)</div>asks Flora.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think I have remarked two little rather dowdy things,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dora</b></font>)</div>says Dora.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They are as good girls as any in England!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>breaks out Harry, to whom no
one had thought of saying a single word. His (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) reign was over, you see. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
was nobody. What wonder, then, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) should not be visible?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, indeed, cousin!''  (<font color='red'><b>Dora</b></font>)</div>says Dora, with a glance at the young man, who
sate with burning cheeks, chafing at the humiliation put upon him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), but
not knowing how or whether he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) should notice it. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, indeed, cousin! You
are very charitable--or very lucky, I'm sure! You see angels where we
only see ordinary little persons. I'm sure I could not imagine who were
those odd-looking people in Lord Wrotham's coach, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) handsome
liveries. But if they were three angels, I have nothing to say.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My brother is an enthusiast,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>interposes George. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) is often mistaken
about women.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, really!''  (<font color='red'><b>Dora</b></font>)</div>says Dora, looking a little uneasy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I fear my nephew Henry has indeed met with some unfavourable specimens
of our sex,''  (<font color='red'><b>matron</b></font>)</div>the matron remarks, with a groan.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We are so easily taken in, madam--we are both very young yet--we shall
grow older and learn better.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Most sincerely, nephew George, I trust you may. You have my best

 (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And when my uncle Sir Miles was out of town,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>says George, looking
towards the Baronet, who smiles at him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) with affectionate approval.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``--I sent your brother a work which I thought might comfort him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>), and I

but my duty--a humble woman's duty--for what are this world's goods,
nephew, compared to the welfare of a soul? If I did good, I am thankful;
if I was useful, I rejoice. If, through my means, you have been brought,
Harry, to consider--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! the sermon, is it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>breaks in downright Harry. <div class="bookquote">``I hadn't time to
read a single syllable of it, aunt--thank you. You see I don't care much
about that kind of thing--but thank you all the same.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The intention is everything,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Warrington, <div class="bookquote">``and we are both
grateful. Our dear friend, General Lambert, intended to give bail for
Harry; but, happily, I had funds of Harry's with me to meet any demands
upon us. But the kindness is the same, and I am grateful to the friend
who hastened to my brother's rescue when he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) had most need of aid, and
when his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) own relations happened--so unfortunately--to be out of town.''

 (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Anything I could do, my dear boy, I'm sure--my brother's son--my own

 (<font color='red'><b>Miles/Miles Warrington</b></font>)</div>cries Sir Miles, bringing his (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) own hand into George's with a generous
smack. <div class="bookquote">``You can't stay and dine with us? Put off the Colonel--the
General--do, now! Or name a day. My Lady Warrington, make my nephew name
a day when he (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) will sit under his (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) grandfather's picture, and drink some
of his (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) wine!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``His (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) intellectual faculties seem more developed than those of his (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>)
unlucky younger brother,''  (<font color='red'><b>lady</b></font>)</div>remarked my lady, when the young gentlemen had
taken their leave. <div class="bookquote">``The younger must be reckless and extravagant about
money indeed, for did you remark, Sir Miles, the loss of his (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>)
reversion in Virginia--the amount of which has, no doubt, been grossly
exaggerated, but, nevertheless, must be something considerable--did
you, I say, remark that the ruin of Harry's prospects scarcely seemed to
affect him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shouldn't be at all surprised that the elder turns out to be as poor
as the young one,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dora</b></font>)</div>says Dora, tossing her (<font color='blue'><b>Dora</b></font>) head.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)! he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)! Did you see that cousin George had one of cousin Harry's suits

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Far be it from me to object to any innocent amusement, much less to the
music of Mr. Handel, dear Mr. Claypool,''  (<font color='red'><b>mamma</b></font>)</div>says mamma. <div class="bookquote">``Music refines the
soul, elevates the understanding, is heard in our churches, and
`tis well known was practised by King David. Your operas I shun as
deleterious; your ballets I would forbid to my children as most
immoral; but music, my dears! May we enjoy it, like everything else in
reason--may we--''

 (<font color='red'><b>papa</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There's the music of the dinner-bell,''  (<font color='red'><b>papa</b></font>)</div>says papa, rubbing his (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) hands.

oratorios constantly during dinner.




<p/>CHAPTER LI. Conticuere Omnes


<p/>Across the way, if the gracious reader will please to step over with
us, he (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) will find our young gentlemen at Lord Wrotham's house, which
his (<font color='blue'><b>Wrotham</b></font>) lordship has lent to his (<font color='blue'><b>Wrotham</b></font>) friend the General, and that little
family party assembled, with which we made acquaintance at Oakhurst and
Tunbridge Wells. James Wolfe has promised to come to dinner; but James
is dancing attendance upon Miss Lowther, and would rather have a glance
from her (<font color='blue'><b>Lowther</b></font>) eyes than the finest kickshaws dressed by Lord Wrotham's cook,
or the dessert which is promised for the entertainment at which you
are just going to sit down. You will make the sixth. You may take Mr.
Wolfe's place. You may be sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Wolfe</b></font>) won't come. As for me, I will stand at
the sideboard and report the conversation.

<p/>Note first, how happy the women look! When Harry Warrington was taken
by those bailiffs, I had intended to tell you how the good Mrs. Lambert,
hearing of the boy's mishap, had flown to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) husband, and had begged,
implored, insisted, that her (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) Martin should help him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Never mind his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>)
rebeldom of the other day; never mind about his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) being angry that his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>)
presents were returned--of course anybody would be angry, much more such
a high-spirited lad as Harry! Never mind about our being so poor, and
wanting all our spare money for the boys at college; there must be some
way of getting him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) out of the scrape. Did you not get Charles Watkins
out of the scrape two years ago; and did he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) not pay you back every
halfpenny? Yes; and you made a whole family happy, blessed be God! and
Mrs. Watkins prays for you and blesses you to this very day, and I think
everything has prospered with us since. And I have no doubt it has made
you a major-general--no earthly doubt,''  (<font color='red'><b>the wife</b></font>)</div>says the fond wife.

<p/>Now, as Martin Lambert requires very little persuasion to do a kind
action, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) in this instance lets himself be persuaded easily enough, and
having made up his (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) mind to seek for friend James Wolfe, and give bail
for Harry, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) takes his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) leave and his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hat, and squeezes Theo's hand, who
seems to divine his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) errand -LRB-or perhaps that silly mamma has blabbed it-RRB-,
and kisses little Hetty's flushed cheek, and away he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) goes out of the
apartment where the girls and their mother are sitting, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) is
followed out of the room by the latter.

<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) is alone with him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), that enthusiastic matron cannot control
her (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>) feelings any longer. She (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>) flings her (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>) arms round her (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>) husband's neck,
kisses him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) a hundred and twenty-five times in an instant--calls God to
bless him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)--cries plentifully on his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) shoulder; and in this sentimental
attitude is discovered by old Mrs. Quiggett, my lord's housekeeper, who
is bustling about the house, and, I suppose, is quite astounded at the
conjugal phenomenon.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We have had a tiff, and we are making it up! Don't tell tales out of
school, Mrs. Quiggett!''  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>says the gentleman, walking off.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I never!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Quiggett/Quiggett</b></font>)</div>says Mrs. Quiggett, with a shrill, strident laugh, like
a venerable old cockatoo--which white, hook-nosed, long-lived bird Mrs.
Quiggett strongly resembles. <div class="bookquote">``Well, I never!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Quiggett/Quiggett</b></font>)</div>says Quiggett, laughing
and shaking her (<font color='blue'><b>Quiggett</b></font>) old sides till all her (<font color='blue'><b>Quiggett</b></font>) keys, and, as one may fancy, her (<font color='blue'><b>Quiggett</b></font>)
old ribs clatter and jingle.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Quiggett!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Lambert/Lambert</b></font>)</div>sobs out Mrs. Lambert, <div class="bookquote">``what a man that is!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Lambert/Lambert</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You've been a-quarrelling, have you, mum, and making it up? That's
right.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Quarrel with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)? He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) never told a greater story. My General is an
angel, Quiggett. I should like to worship him (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>). I should like to fall
down at his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) boots and kiss `em, I should! There never was a man so good
as my General. What have I done to have such a man? How dare I have such
a good husband?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear, I think there's a pair of you,''  (<font color='red'><b>the cockatoo</b></font>)</div>says the old cockatoo; <div class="bookquote">``and
what would you like for your supper?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the cockatoo</b></font>)</div><p/>When Lambert comes back very late to that meal, and tells what has
happened, how Harry is free, and how his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) brother has come to life, and
rescued him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), you may fancy what a commotion the whole of those people
are in! If Mrs. Lambert's General was an angel before, what is he (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) now!
If she (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) wanted to embrace his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) boots in the morning, pray what further
office of wallowing degradation would she (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) prefer in the evening? Little
Hetty comes and nestles up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) father quite silent, and drinks
a little drop out of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) glass. Theo's and mamma's faces beam with
happiness, like two moons of brightness... After supper, those four at
a certain signal fall down on their knees--glad homage paying in awful
mirth-rejoicing, and with such pure joy as angels do, we read, for the
sinner that repents. There comes a great knocking at the door whilst
they are so gathered together. Who can be there? My lord is in the
country miles off. It is past midnight now; so late have they been, so
long have they been talking! I think Mrs. Lambert guesses who is there.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This is George,''  (<font color='red'><b>a gentleman</b></font>)</div>says a young gentleman, leading in another. <div class="bookquote">``We have
been to Aunt Bernstein. We couldn't go to bed, Aunt Lambert, without
coming to thank you too. You dear, dear, good--''  (<font color='red'><b>Aunt</b></font>)</div>There is no more
speech audible. Aunt Lambert is kissing Harry, Theo has snatched up
Hetty who is as pale as death, and is hugging her (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) into life again.
George Warrington stands with his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) hat off, and then -LRB-when Harry's
transaction is concluded-RRB- goes up and kisses Mrs. Lambert's hand: the
General passes his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) across his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) eyes. I protest they are all in a very
tender and happy state. Generous hearts sometimes feel it, when Wrong
is forgiven, when Peace is restored, when Love returns that had been
thought lost.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We came from Aunt Bernstein's; we saw lights here, you see; we couldn't
go to sleep without saying good-night to you all,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>says Harry. <div class="bookquote">``Could
we, George?''

 (<font color='red'><b>boys</b></font>)</div><p/>```Tis certainly a famous nightcap you have brought us, boys,'' says the
General. <div class="bookquote">``When are you to come and dine with us? To-morrow?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>No, they
must go to Madame Bernstein's to-morrow.

<p/>The next day, then? Yes, they would come the next day--and that is the
very day we are writing about: and this is the very dinner, at which, in
the room of Lieutenant-Colonel James Wolfe, absent on private affairs,
my gracious reader has just been invited to sit down.

<p/>To sit down, and why, if you please? Not to a mere Barmecide dinner--no,
no--but to hear MR. GEORGE ESMOND WARRINGTON'S STATEMENT, which of
course he (<font color='blue'><b>WARRINGTON</b></font>) is going to make. Here they all sit--not in my lord's grand
dining-room, you know, but in the snug study or parlour in front. The
cloth has been withdrawn, the General has given the King's health, the
servants have left the room, the guests sit conticent, and so, after a
little hemming and blushing, Mr. George proceeds:--

<p/>``I remember, at the table of our General, how the little Philadelphia
agent, whose wit and shrewdness we had remarked at home, made the very
objections to the conduct of the campaign of which its disastrous issue
showed the justice. `Of course,' says he (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>), `your Excellency's troops once
before Fort Duquesne, such a weak little place will never be able to
resist such a general, such an army, such artillery, as will there be
found attacking it. But do you calculate, sir, on the difficulty of
reaching the place? Your Excellency's march will be through woods almost
untrodden, over roads which you will have to make yourself, and your
line will be some four miles long. This slender line, having to make its
way through the forest, will be subject to endless attacks in front, in
rear, in flank, by enemies whom you will never see, and whose constant
practice in war is the dexterous laying of ambuscades.'--`Psha, sir!'
says the General, `the savages may frighten your raw American militia'
-LRB-Thank your Excellency for the compliment, Mr. Washington seems to
say, who is sitting at the table-RRB-, `but the Indians will never make
any impression on his (<font color='blue'><b>Washington</b></font>) Majesty's regular troops.'--`I heartily hope not,
sir,' says Mr. Franklin, with a sigh; and of course the gentlemen of the
General's family sneered at the postmaster, as at a pert civilian who
had no call to be giving his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) opinion on matters entirely beyond his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>)
comprehension.

<p/>``We despised the Indians on our own side, and our commander made light
of them and their service. Our officers disgusted the chiefs who were
with us by outrageous behaviour to their women. There were not above
seven or eight who remained with our force. Had we had a couple of
hundred in our front on that fatal 9th of July, the event of the day
must have been very different. They would have flung off the attack of
the French Indians; they would have prevented the surprise and panic
which ensued. `Tis known now that the French had even got ready to give
up their fort, never dreaming of the possibility of a defence, and
that the French Indians themselves remonstrated against the audacity of
attacking such an overwhelming force as ours.

<p/>``I was with our General with the main body of the troops when the
firing began in front of us, and one aide-de-camp after another was sent
forwards. At first the enemy's attack was answered briskly by our own
advanced people, and our men huzzaed and cheered with good heart. But
very soon our fire grew slacker, whilst from behind every tree and bush
round about us came single shots, which laid man after man low. We were
marching in orderly line, the skirmishers in front, the colours and two
of our small guns in the centre, the baggage well guarded bringing up
the rear, and were moving over a ground which was open and clear for a
mile or two, and for some half mile in breadth, a thick tangled covert
of brushwood and trees on either side of us. After the firing had
continued for some brief time in front, it opened from both sides of the
environing wood on our advancing column. The men dropped rapidly, the
officers in greater number than the men. At first, as I said, these
cheered and answered the enemy's fire, our guns even opening on the
wood, and seeming to silence the French in ambuscade there. But the
hidden rifle-firing began again. Our men halted, huddled up together, in
spite of the shouts and orders of the General and officers to advance,
and fired wildly into the brushwood--of course making no impression.
Those in advance came running back on the main body frightened, and many
of them wounded. They reported there were five thousand Frenchmen and a
legion of yelling Indian devils in front, who were scalping our people
as they fell. We could hear their cries from the wood around as our
men dropped under their rifles. There was no inducing the people to go
forward now. One aide-de-camp after another was sent forward, and never
returned. At last it came to be my turn, and I was sent with a message
to Captain Fraser of Halkett's in front, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Fraser</b></font>) was never to receive
nor I to deliver.

<p/>``I had not gone thirty yards in advance when a rifle-ball struck my
leg, and I fell straightway to the ground. I recollect a rush forward
of Indians and Frenchmen after that, the former crying their fiendish
war-cries, the latter as fierce as their savage allies. I was amazed and
mortified to see how few of the whitecoats there were. Not above a score
passed me; indeed there were not fifty in the accursed action in which
two of the bravest regiments of the British army were put to rout.

<p/>``One of them, who was half Indian half Frenchman, with mocassins and
a white uniform coat and cockade, seeing me prostrate on the ground,
turned back and ran towards me, his (<font color='blue'><b>Frenchman</b></font>) musket clubbed over his (<font color='blue'><b>Frenchman</b></font>) head to dash
my brains out and plunder me as I lay. I had my little fusil which
my Harry gave me when I went on the campaign; it had fallen by me and
within my reach, luckily: I seized it, and down fell the Frenchman dead
at six yards before me. I was saved for that time, but bleeding from my
wound and very faint. I swooned almost in trying to load my piece,
and it dropped from my hand, and the hand itself sank lifeless to the
ground.

<p/>``I was scarcely in my senses, the yells and shots ringing dimly in
my ears, when I saw an Indian before me, busied over the body of the
Frenchman I had just shot, but glancing towards me as I lay on the
ground bleeding. He (<font color='blue'><b>Frenchman</b></font>) first rifled the Frenchman, tearing open his (<font color='blue'><b>Frenchman</b></font>) coat,
and feeling in his (<font color='blue'><b>Frenchman</b></font>) pockets: he (<font color='blue'><b>Frenchman</b></font>) then scalped him (<font color='blue'><b>Frenchman</b></font>), and with his (<font color='blue'><b>Frenchman</b></font>) bleeding
knife in his (<font color='blue'><b>Frenchman</b></font>) mouth advanced towards me. I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Frenchman</b></font>) coming as through a
film, as in a dream--I was powerless to move, or to resist him (<font color='blue'><b>Frenchman</b></font>).

<p/>``He (<font color='blue'><b>Frenchman</b></font>) put his (<font color='blue'><b>Frenchman</b></font>) knee upon my chest: with one bloody hand he (<font color='blue'><b>Frenchman</b></font>) seized my long
hair and lifted my head from the ground, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Frenchman</b></font>) lifted it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Frenchman</b></font>) enabled
me to see a French officer rapidly advancing behind him (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>).

<p/>``Good God! It was young Florac, who was my second in the duel at Quebec.
`A moi, Florac!' I cried out. `C’est Georges! aide moi!'

<p/>``He (<font color='blue'><b>Georges</b></font>) started; ran up to me at the cry, laid his (<font color='blue'><b>Georges</b></font>) hand on the Indian's
shoulder, and called him (<font color='blue'><b>Georges</b></font>) to hold. But the savage did not understand
French, or choose to understand it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Georges</b></font>) clutched my hair firmer, and
waving his (<font color='blue'><b>Georges</b></font>) dripping knife round it, motioned to the French lad to leave
him (<font color='blue'><b>Georges</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>Georges</b></font>) prey. I could only cry out again and piteously, `A moi!'

<p/>```Ah, canaille, tu veux du sang? Prends!' said Florac, with a curse; and
the next moment, and with an ugh, the Indian fell over my chest dead,
with Florac's sword through his (<font color='blue'><b>Indian</b></font>) body.

<p/>``My friend looked round him (<font color='blue'><b>Indian</b></font>). `Eh!' says he (<font color='blue'><b>Indian</b></font>), `la belle affaire! Where art
thou wounded? in the leg?' He (<font color='blue'><b>Indian</b></font>) bound my leg tight round with his (<font color='blue'><b>Indian</b></font>) sash.
`The others will kill thee if they find thee here. Ah, tiens! Put me on
this coat, and this hat with the white cockade. Call out in French if
any of our people pass. They will take thee for one of us. Thou art
Brunet of the Quebec Volunteers. God guard thee, Brunet! I must go
forward. `Tis a general debacle, and the whole of your redcoats are on
the run, my poor boy.' Ah, what a rout it was! What a day of disgrace
for England!

<p/>``Florac's rough application stopped the bleeding of my leg, and the kind
creature helped me to rest against a tree, and to load my fusil, which
he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) placed within reach of me, to protect me in case any other marauder
should have a mind to attack me. And he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) gave me the gourd of that
unlucky French soldier, who had lost his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) own life in the deadly game
which he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had just played against me, and the drink the gourd contained
served greatly to refresh and invigorate me. Taking a mark of the tree
against which I lay, and noting the various bearings of the country, so
as to be able again to find me, the young lad hastened on to the front.
`Thou seest how much I love thee, George,' he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) said, `that I stay behind
in a moment like this.' I forget whether I told thee Harry, that Florac
was under some obligation to me. I had won money of him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) at cards,
at Quebec--only playing at his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) repeated entreaty--and there was a
difficulty about paying, and I remitted his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) debt to me, and lighted
my pipe with his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) note-of-hand. You see, sir, that you are not the only
gambler in the family.

<p/>``At evening, when the dismal pursuit was over, the faithful fellow came
back to me, with a couple of Indians, who had each reeking scalps at
their belts, and whom he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) informed that I was a Frenchman, his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) brother,
who had been wounded early in the day, and must be carried back to the
fort. They laid me in one of their blankets, and carried me, groaning,
with the trusty Florac by my side. Had he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) left me, they would assuredly
have laid me down, plundered me, and added my hair to that of the
wretches whose bleeding spoils hung at their girdles. He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) promised them
brandy at the fort, if they brought me safely there: I have but a dim
recollection of the journey: the anguish of my wound was extreme: I
fainted more than once. We came to the end of our march at last. I was
taken into the fort, and carried to the officer's log-house, and laid
upon Florac's own bed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Happy for me was my insensibility. I had been brought into the fort
as a wounded French soldier of the garrison. I heard afterwards, that
during my delirium the few prisoners who had been made on the day of our
disaster, had been brought under the walls of Duquesne by their savage
captors, and there horribly burned, tortured, and butchered by the
Indians, under the eyes of the garrison.''

 (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div><p/>As George speaks, one may fancy a thrill of horror running through his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
sympathising audience. Theo takes Hetty's hand, and looks at George in
a very alarmed manner. Harry strikes his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) fist upon the table, and cries,
<div class="bookquote">``The bloody, murderous, red-skinned villains! There will never be peace
for us until they are all hunted down!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They were offering a hundred and thirty dollars apiece for Indian
scalps in Pennsylvania, when I left home,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>says George, demurely, <div class="bookquote">``and
fifty for women.''

 (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Fifty for women, my love! Do you hear that, Mrs. Lambert?''  (<font color='red'><b>the Colonel</b></font>)</div>cries the
Colonel, lifting up his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) wife's hair.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The murderous villains!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>says Harry, again. <div class="bookquote">``Hunt `em down, sir! Hunt
`em down!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know not how long I lay in my fever,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>George resumed. ``When I awoke
to my senses, my dear Florac was gone. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hunt</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Hunt</b></font>) company had been
despatched on an enterprise against an English fort on the Pennsylvanian
territory, which the French claimed, too. In Duquesne, when I came to
be able to ask and understand what was said to me, there were not above
thirty Europeans left. The place might have been taken over and over
again, had any of our people had the courage to return after their
disaster.

<p/>``My old enemy the ague-fever set in again upon me as I lay here by the
river-side. `Tis a wonder how I ever survived. But for the goodness of
a half-breed woman in the fort, who took pity on me, and tended me, I
never should have recovered, and my poor Harry would be what he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) fancied
himself yesterday, our grandfather's heir, our mother's only son.

<p/>``I remembered how, when Florac laid me in his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) bed, he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) put under my
pillow my money, my watch, and a trinket or two which I had. When I
woke to myself these were all gone; and a surly old sergeant, the only
officer left in the quarter, told me, with a curse, that I was lucky
enough to be left with my life at all; that it was only my white cockade
and coat had saved me from the fate which the other canaille of Rosbifs
had deservedly met with.

<p/>``At the time of my recovery the fort was almost emptied of the garrison.
The Indians had retired enriched with British plunder, and the chief
part of the French regulars were gone upon expeditions northward. My
good Florac had left me upon his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) service, consigning me to the care of
an invalided sergeant. Monsieur de Contrecoeur had accompanied one of
these expeditions, leaving an old lieutenant, Museau by name, in command
at Duquesne.

<p/>``This man had long been out of France, and serving in the colonies. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
character, doubtless, had been indifferent at home; and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knew that,
according to the system pursued in France, where almost all promotion is
given to the noblesse, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) never would advance in rank. And he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had made
free with my guineas, I suppose, as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had with my watch, for I saw it
one day on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) chest when I was sitting with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) quarter.

<p/>``Monsieur Museau and I managed to be pretty good friends. If I could be
exchanged, or sent home, I told him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) that my mother would pay liberally
for my ransom; and I suppose this idea excited the cupidity of the
commandant, for a trapper coming in the winter, whilst I still lay very
ill with fever, Museau consented that I should write home to my mother,
but that the letter should be in French, that he (<font color='blue'><b>trapper</b></font>) should see it, and
that I should say I was in the hands of the Indians, and should not be
ransomed under ten thousand livres.

<p/>``In vain I said I was a prisoner to the troops of his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) Most Christian
Majesty, that I expected the treatment of a gentleman and an officer.
Museau swore that letter should go, and no other; that if I hesitated,
he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) would fling me out of the fort, or hand me over to the tender mercies
of his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) ruffian Indian allies. He (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) would not let the trapper communicate
with me except in his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) presence. Life and liberty are sweet. I resisted
for a while, but I was pulled down with weakness, and shuddering with
fever; I wrote such a letter as the rascal consented to let pass, and
the trapper went away with my missive, which he (<font color='blue'><b>trapper</b></font>) promised, in three
weeks, to deliver to my mother in Virginia.

<p/>``Three weeks, six, twelve, passed. The messenger never returned. The
winter came and went, and all our little plantations round the fort,
where the French soldiers had cleared corn-ground and planted gardens
and peach- and apple-trees down to the Monongahela, were in full
blossom. Heaven knows how I crept through the weary time! When I was
pretty well, I made drawings of the soldiers of the garrison, and of the
half-breed and her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) child -LRB-Museau's child-RRB-, and of Museau himself, whom,
I am ashamed to say, I flattered outrageously; and there was an old
guitar left in the fort, and I sang to it, and played on it some French
airs which I knew, and ingratiated myself as best I could with my
gaolers; and so the weary months passed, but the messenger never
returned.

<p/>``At last news arrived that he (<font color='blue'><b>Museau</b></font>) had been shot by some British Indians in
Maryland: so there was an end of my hope of ransom for some months more.
This made Museau very savage and surly towards me; the more so as his (<font color='blue'><b>Museau</b></font>)
sergeant inflamed his (<font color='blue'><b>Museau</b></font>) rage by telling him (<font color='blue'><b>Museau</b></font>) that the Indian woman was
partial to me--as I believe, poor thing, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was. I was always gentle
with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), and grateful to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). My small accomplishments seemed wonders
in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) eyes; I was ill and unhappy, too, and these are always claims to
a woman's affection.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A captive pulled down by malady, a ferocious gaoler, and a young woman
touched by the prisoner's misfortunes--sure you expect that, with these
three prime characters in a piece, some pathetic tragedy is going to be
enacted? You, Miss Hetty, are about to guess that the woman saved me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, of course she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) did!''  (<font color='red'><b>mamma</b></font>)</div>cries mamma.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What else is she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) good for?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hetty/Miss Hetty/Lambert</b></font>)</div>says Hetty.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You, Miss Theo, have painted her (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) already as a dark beauty--is it not
so? A swift huntress--''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``--Who scours the plain with her (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) nymphs, who brings down the game with

<p/>``For whisky, my dear Miss Hester--in which appetite my gaoler partook;
so that I have often sate by, on the nights when I was in favour with
Monsieur Museau, and seen him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) poor companion hob-and-nobbing
together until they could scarce hold the noggin out of which they
drank. In these evening entertainments, they would sing, they would
dance, they would fondle, they would quarrel, and knock the cans and
furniture about; and, when I was in favour, I was admitted to share
their society, for Museau, jealous of his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) dignity, or not willing that
his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) men should witness his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) behaviour, would allow none of them to be
familiar with him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>).

<p/>``Whilst the result of the trapper's mission to my home was yet
uncertain, and Museau and I myself expected the payment of my ransom, I
was treated kindly enough, allowed to crawl about the fort, and even to
go into the adjoining fields and gardens, always keeping my parole, and
duly returning before gun-fire. And I exercised a piece of hypocrisy,
for which, I hope, you will hold me excused. When my leg was sound -LRB-the
ball came out in the winter, after some pain and inflammation, and the
wound healed up presently-RRB-, I yet chose to walk as if I was disabled
and a cripple; I hobbled on two sticks, and cried Ah! and Oh! at every
minute, hoping that a day might come when I might treat my limbs to a
run.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Museau was very savage when he (<font color='blue'><b>cripple</b></font>) began to give up all hopes of the first
messenger. He (<font color='blue'><b>cripple</b></font>) fancied that the man might have got the ransom-money and
fled with it himself. Of course he (<font color='blue'><b>cripple</b></font>) was prepared to disown any part in
the transaction, should my letter be discovered. His (<font color='blue'><b>cripple</b></font>) treatment of me
varied according to his (<font color='blue'><b>cripple</b></font>) hopes or fears, or even his (<font color='blue'><b>cripple</b></font>) mood for the time
being. He (<font color='blue'><b>cripple</b></font>) would have me consigned to my quarters for several days at a
time; then invite me to his (<font color='blue'><b>cripple</b></font>) tipsy supper-table, quarrel with me there,
and abuse my nation; or again break out into maudlin sentimentalities
about his (<font color='blue'><b>cripple</b></font>) native country of Normandy, where he (<font color='blue'><b>cripple</b></font>) longed to spend his (<font color='blue'><b>cripple</b></font>) old
age, to buy a field or two, and to die happy.

<p/>```Eh, Monsieur Museau!' says I, `ten thousand livres of your money would
buy a pretty field or two in your native country? You can have it for
the ransom of me, if you will but let me go. In a few months you must
be superseded in your command here, and then adieu the crowns and
the fields in Normandy! You had better trust a gentleman and a man of
honour. Let me go home, and I give you my word the ten thousand livres
shall be paid to any agent you may appoint in France or in Quebec.'

<p/>```Ah, young traitor!' roars he (<font color='blue'><b>traitor</b></font>), `do you wish to tamper with my honour?
Do you believe an officer of France will take a bribe? I have a mind to
consign thee to my black-hole, and to have thee shot in the morning.'

<p/>```My poor body will never fetch ten thousand livres,' says I; `and a
pretty field in Normandy with a cottage...'

<p/>```And an orchard. Ah, sacre bleu!' says Museau, whimpering, `and a dish
of tripe a la mode du pays!...''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``This talk happened between us again and again, and Museau would order

better than George, Mrs. Lambert! a poor, extravagant fellow like me!
It's absurd!''




 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Lambert/Lambert</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER LII. Intentique Ora tenebant


<p/>``We continued for months our weary life at the fort, and the commandant
and I had our quarrels and reconciliations, our greasy games at cards,
our dismal duets with his (<font color='blue'><b>commandant</b></font>) asthmatic flute and my cracked guitar. The
poor Fawn took her (<font color='blue'><b>Fawn</b></font>) beatings and her (<font color='blue'><b>Fawn</b></font>) cans of liquor as her (<font color='blue'><b>Fawn</b></font>) lord and
master chose to administer them; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Fawn</b></font>) nursed her (<font color='blue'><b>Fawn</b></font>) papoose, or her (<font color='blue'><b>Fawn</b></font>)
master in the gout, or her (<font color='blue'><b>Fawn</b></font>) prisoner in the ague; and so matters went on
until the beginning of the fall of last year, when we were visited by a
hunter who had important news to deliver to the commandant, and such as
set the little garrison in no little excitement. The Marquis de Montcalm
had sent a considerable detachment to garrison the forts already in the
French hands, and to take up further positions in the enemy's--that is,
in the British--possessions. The troops had left Quebec and Montreal,
and were coming up the St. Lawrence and the lakes in bateaux, with
artillery and large provisions of warlike and other stores. Museau would
be superseded in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lawrence</b></font>) command by an officer of superior rank, who might
exchange me, or who might give me up to the Indians in reprisal for
cruelties practised by our own people on many and many an officer
and soldier of the enemy. The men of the fort were eager for the
reinforcements; they would advance into Pennsylvania and New York; they
would seize upon Albany and Philadelphia; they would drive the Rosbifs
into the sea, and all America should be theirs from the Mississippi to
Newfoundland.

<p/>``This was all very triumphant: but yet, somehow, the prospect of the
French conquest did not add to Mr. Museau's satisfaction.

<p/>```Eh, commandant!' says I, `'tis fort bien, but meanwhile your farm in
Normandy, the pot of cider, and the trippes a la mode de Caen, where are
they?'

<p/>```Yes; `tis all very well, my garcon,' says he (<font color='blue'><b>commandant</b></font>). `But where will you
be when poor old Museau is superseded? Other officers are not good
companions like me. Very few men in the world have my humanity. When
there is a great garrison here, will my successors give thee the
indulgences which honest Museau has granted thee? Thou wilt be kept in
a sty like a pig ready for killing. As sure as one of our officers falls
into the hands of your brigands of frontier-men, and evil comes to him (<font color='blue'><b>commandant</b></font>),
so surely wilt thou have to pay with thy skin for his (<font color='blue'><b>commandant</b></font>). Thou wilt be
given up to our red allies--to the brethren of La Biche yonder. Didst
thou see, last year, what they did to thy countrymen whom we took in
the action with Braddock? Roasting was the very smallest punishment, ma
foi--was it not, La Biche?'

<p/>``And he (<font color='blue'><b>Braddock</b></font>) entered into a variety of jocular descriptions of tortures
inflicted, eyes burned out of their sockets, teeth and nails wrenched
out, limbs and bodies gashed--You turn pale, dear Miss Theo! Well, I
will have pity, and will spare you the tortures which honest Museau
recounted in his (<font color='blue'><b>Braddock</b></font>) pleasant way as likely to befall me.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``La Biche was by no means so affected as you seem to be, ladies, by the
recital of these horrors. She (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) had witnessed them in her (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) time. She (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) came
from the Senecas, whose villages lie near the great cataract between
Ontario and Erie; her (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) people made war for the English, and against them:
they had fought with other tribes; and, in the battles between us
and them, it is difficult to say whether whiteskin or redskin is most
savage.

<p/>```They may chop me into cutlets and broil me, `tis true, commandant,'
says I, coolly. `But again, I say, you will never have the farm in
Normandy.'

<p/>```Go get the whisky-bottle, La Biche,' says Museau.

<p/>```And it is not too late, even now. I will give the guide who takes me
home a large reward. And again I say, I promise, as a man of honour,
ten thousand livres to--whom shall I say? to one who shall bring me any
token--who shall bring me, say, my watch and seal with my grandfather's
arms--which I have seen in a chest somewhere in this fort.'

<p/>```Ah, scelerat!' roars out the commandant, with a hoarse yell of
laughter. `Thou hast eyes, thou! All is good prize in war.'

<p/>```Think of a house in your village, of a fine field hard by with a
half-dozen of cows--of a fine orchard all covered with fruit.'

<p/>```And Javotte at the door with her (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) wheel, and a rascal of a child,
or two, with cheeks as red as the apples! O my country! O my mother!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>whimpers out the commandant. `Quick, La Biche, the whisky!'

<p/>``All that night the commandant was deep in thought, and La Biche, too,
silent and melancholy. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) sate away from us, nursing her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) child, and
whenever my eyes turned towards her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) I saw hers were fixed on me. The
poor little infant began to cry, and was ordered away by Museau, with
his (<font color='blue'><b>commandant</b></font>) usual foul language, to the building which the luckless Biche
occupied with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) child. When she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was gone, we both of us spoke our
minds freely; and I put such reasons before monsieur as his (<font color='blue'><b>commandant</b></font>) cupidity
could not resist.

<p/>```How do you know,' he (<font color='blue'><b>commandant</b></font>) asked, `that this hunter will serve you?'

<p/>```That is my secret,' says I. But here, if you like, as we are not on
honour, I may tell it. When they come into the settlements for their
bargains, the hunters often stop a day or two for rest and drink and
company, and our new friend loved all these. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) played at cards with
the men: he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) set his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) furs against their liquor: he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) enjoyed himself at
the fort, singing, dancing, and gambling with them. I think I said they
liked to listen to my songs, and for want of better things to do, I was
often singing and guitar-scraping: and we would have many a concert,
the men joining in chorus, or dancing to my homely music, until it was
interrupted by the drums and the retraite.

<p/>``Our guest the hunter was present at one or two of these concerts, and I
thought I would try if possibly he (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) understood English. After we had had
our little stock of French songs, I said, `My lads, I will give you an
English song,' and to the tune of `Over the hills and far away,' which
my good old grandfather used to hum as a favourite air in Marlborough's
camp, I made some doggerel words:--`This long, long year, a prisoner
drear; Ah, me! I'm tired of lingering here: I'll give a hundred guineas
gay, To be over the hills and far away.'

<p/>```What is it?' says the hunter. `I don't understand.'

<p/>```'Tis a girl to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) lover,' I answered; but I saw by the twinkle in the
man's eye that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) understood me.

<p/>``The next day, when there were no men within hearing, the trapper showed
that I was right in my conjecture, for as he (<font color='blue'><b>trapper</b></font>) passed me he (<font color='blue'><b>trapper</b></font>) hummed in a
low tone, but in perfectly good English, `Over the hills and far away,'
the burden of my yesterday's doggerel.

<p/>```If you are ready,' says he (<font color='blue'><b>trapper</b></font>), `I am ready. I know who your people are,
and the way to them. Talk to the Fawn, and she (<font color='blue'><b>trapper</b></font>) will tell you what to
do. What! You will not play with me?' Here he (<font color='blue'><b>trapper</b></font>) pulled out some cards, and
spoke in French as two soldiers came up. `Milor est trop grand seigneur?
Bonjour, my lord!'

<p/>``And the man made me a mock bow, and walked away, shrugging up his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
shoulders, to offer to play and drink elsewhere.

<p/>``I knew now that the Biche was to be the agent in the affair, and that
my offer to Museau was accepted. The poor Fawn performed her (<font color='blue'><b>Fawn</b></font>) part very
faithfully and dexterously. I had not need of a word more with Museau;
the matter was understood between us. The Fawn had long been allowed
free communication with me. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fawn</b></font>) had tended me during my wound and in my
illnesses, helped to do the work of my little chamber, my cooking, and
so forth. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fawn</b></font>) was free to go out of the fort, as I have said, and to
the river and the fields whence the corn and garden-stuff of the little
garrison were brought in.

<p/>``Having gambled away most of the money which he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) received for his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)
peltries, the trapper now got together his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) store of flints, powder, and
blankets, and took his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) leave. And, three days after his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) departure, the
Fawn gave me the signal that the time was come for me to make my little
trial for freedom.

<p/>``When first wounded, I had been taken by my kind Florac and placed on
his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) bed in the officers' room. When the fort was emptied of all officers
except the old lieutenant left in command, I had been allowed to remain
in my quarters, sometimes being left pretty free, sometimes being locked
up and fed on prisoners' rations, sometimes invited to share his (<font color='blue'><b>lieutenant</b></font>) mess by
my tipsy gaoler.

<p/>``This officers' house, or room, was of logs like the half-dozen others
within the fort, which mounted only four guns of small calibre, of which
one was on the bastion behind my cabin. Looking westward over this gun,
you could see a small island at the confluence of the two rivers Ohio
and Monongahela whereon Duquesne is situated. On the shore opposite this
island were some trees.

<p/>```You see those trees?' my poor Biche said to me the day before, in her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)
French jargon. `He (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) wait for you behind those trees.'

<p/>``In the daytime the door of my quarters was open, and the Biche free to
come and go. On the day before she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) came in from the fields with a pick
in her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) hand and a basketful of vegetables and potherbs for soup. She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) sat
down on a bench at my door, the pick resting against it, and the basket
at her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) side. I stood talking to her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) for a while: but I believe I was so
idiotic that I never should have thought of putting the pick to any use
had she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) actually pushed it into my open door, so that it fell into my
room. `Hide it' she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) said; `want it soon.' And that afternoon it was, she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)
pointed out the trees to me.

<p/>``On the next day, she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) comes, pretending to be very angry, and calls out,
`My lord! my lord! why you not come to commandant's dinner? He (<font color='blue'><b>commandant</b></font>) very bad!
Entendez-vows?' And she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) peeps into the room as she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) speaks, and flings a
coil of rope at me.

<p/>```I am coming, La Biche,' says I, and hobbled after her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) on my crutch.
As I went in to the commandant's quarters she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) says, `Pour ce soir.' And
then I knew the time was come.

<p/>``As for Museau, he (<font color='blue'><b>commandant</b></font>) knew nothing about the matter. Not he (<font color='blue'><b>commandant</b></font>)! He (<font color='blue'><b>commandant</b></font>) growled at
me, and said the soup was cold. He (<font color='blue'><b>commandant</b></font>) looked me steadily in the face, and
talked of this and that; not only whilst his (<font color='blue'><b>commandant</b></font>) servant was present, but
afterwards as we smoked our pipes and played our game at piquet; whilst
according to her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) wont, the poor Biche sate cowering in a corner.

<p/>``My friend's whisky-bottle was empty; and he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) said, with rather a knowing
look, he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) must have another glass--we must both have a glass that night.
And rising from the table he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) stumped to the inner room where he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) kept his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)
fire-water under lock and key, and away from the poor Biche, who could
not resist that temptation.

<p/>``As he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) turned his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) back the Biche raised herself; and he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) was no sooner
gone but she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) was at my feet, kissing my hand, pressing it to her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) heart,
and bursting into tears over my knees. I confess I was so troubled by
this testimony of the poor creature's silent attachment and fondness,
the extent of which I scarce had suspected before, that when Museau
returned, I had not recovered my equanimity, though the poor Fawn was
back in her (<font color='blue'><b>Fawn</b></font>) corner again and shrouded in her (<font color='blue'><b>Fawn</b></font>) blanket.

<p/>``He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) did not appear to remark anything strange in the behaviour of
either. We sate down to our game, though my thoughts were so preoccupied
that I scarcely knew what cards were before me.

<p/>```I gain everything from you to-night, milor,' says he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>), grimly. `We play
upon parole.'

<p/>```And you may count upon mine,' I replied.

<p/>```Eh! `tis all that you have!' says he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>).

<p/>```Monsieur,' says I, `my word is good for ten thousand livres;' and we
continued our game.

<p/>``At last he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had a headache, and would go to bed, and I
understood the orders too, that I was to retire. `I wish you a good
night, mon petit milor,' says he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>),--`stay, you will fall without your
crutch,'--and his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) eyes twinkled at me, and his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) face wore a sarcastic
grin. In the agitation of the moment I had quite forgotten that I was
lame, and was walking away at a pace as good as a grenadier's.

<p/>```What a vilain night!' says he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>), looking out. In fact there was a
tempest abroad, and a great roaring, and wind. `Bring a lanthorn, La
Tulipe, and lock my lord comfortably into his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) quarters!' He (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) stood a
moment looking at me from his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) own door, and I saw a glimpse of the poor
Biche behind him (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>).

<p/>``The night was so rainy that the sentries preferred their boxes, and did
not disturb me in my work. The log-house was built with upright posts,
deeply fixed in the ground, and horizontal logs laid upon it. I had to
dig under these, and work a hole sufficient to admit my body to pass. I
began in the dark, soon after tattoo. It was some while after midnight
before my work was done, when I lifted my hand up under the log and felt
the rain from without falling upon it. I had to work very cautiously for
two hours after that, and then crept through to the parapet and silently
flung my rope over the gun; not without a little tremor of heart, lest
the sentry should see me and send a charge of lead into my body.

<p/>``The wall was but twelve feet, and my fall into the ditch easy enough. I
waited a while there, looking steadily under the gun, and trying to see
the river and the island. I heard the sentry pacing up above and humming
a tune. The darkness became more clear to me ere long, and the moon
rose, and I saw the river shining before me, and the dark rocks and
trees of the island rising in the waters.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I made for this mark as swiftly as I could, and for the clump of trees
to which I had been directed. Oh, what a relief I had when I heard a low
voice humming there, `Over the hills and far away'!''

 (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div><p/>When Mr. George came to this part of his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) narrative, Miss Theo, who was
seated by a harpsichord, turned round and dashed off the tune on the
instrument, whilst all the little company broke out into the merry
chorus.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Our way,''  (<font color='red'><b>the speaker</b></font>)</div>the speaker went on, <div class="bookquote">``lay through a level tract of
forest with which my guide was familiar, upon the right bank of the
Monongahela. By daylight we came to a clearer country, and my trapper
asked me--Silverheels was the name by which he (<font color='blue'><b>trapper</b></font>) went--had I ever seen
the spot before? It was the fatal field where Braddock had fallen, and
whence I had been wonderfully rescued in the summer of the previous
year. Now, the leaves were beginning to be tinted with the magnificent
hues of our autumn.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the speaker</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, brother!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>cries Harry, seizing his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) brother's hand. <div class="bookquote">``I was gambling
and making a fool of myself at the Wells and in London, when my
George was flying for his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) life in the wilderness! Oh, what a miserable
spendthrift I have been!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I think thou art not unworthy to be called thy mother's son,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Lambert/Lambert</b></font>)</div>said
Mrs. Lambert, very softly, and with moistened eyes. Indeed, if Harry
had erred, to mark his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) repentance, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) love, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) unselfish joy and
generosity, was to feel that there was hope for the humbled and kind
young sinner.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We presently crossed the river''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>George resumed, ``taking our course
along the base of the western slopes of the Alleghanies; and through a
grand forest region of oaks and maple, and enormous poplars that grow
a hundred feet high without a branch. It was the Indians whom we had
to avoid, besides the outlying parties of French. Always of doubtful
loyalty, the savages have been specially against us, since our
ill-treatment of them, and the French triumph over us two years ago.

<p/>``I was but weak still, and our journey through the wilderness lasted a
fortnight or more. As we advanced, the woods became redder and redder.
The frost nipped sharply of nights. We lighted fires at our feet, and
slept in our blankets as best we might. At this time of year the hunters
who live in the mountains get their sugar from the maples. We came upon
more than one such family, camping near their trees by the mountain
streams; and they welcomed us at their fires, and gave us of their
venison. So we passed over the two ranges of the Laurel Hills and the
Alleghanies. The last day's march of my trusty guide and myself took us
down that wild, magnificent pass of Will's Creek, a valley lying between
cliffs near a thousand feet high--bald, white, and broken into towers
like huge fortifications, with eagles wheeling round the summits of the
rocks, and watching their nests among the crags.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And hence we descended to Cumberland, whence we had marched in the year
before, and where there was now a considerable garrison of our people.
Oh! you may think it was a welcome day when I saw English colours again
on the banks of our native Potomac!''




 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER LIII. Where we remain at the Court End of the Town


<p/>George Warrington had related the same story, which we have just heard,
to Madame de Bernstein on the previous evening--a portion, that is, of
the history; for the old lady nodded off to sleep many times during
the narration, only waking up when George paused, saying it was most
interesting, and ordering him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) to continue. The young gentleman hem'd and
ha'd, and stuttered, and blushed, and went on, much against his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) will,
and did not speak half so well as he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) did to his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) friendly little auditory
in Hill Street, where Hetty's eyes of wonder and Theo's sympathising
looks, and mamma's kind face, and papa's funny looks, were applause
sufficient to cheer any modest youth who required encouragement for his (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>)
eloquence. As for mamma's behaviour, the General said, `twas as good as
Mr. Addison's trunk-maker, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) would make the fortune of any tragedy
by simply being engaged to cry in the front boxes. That is why we chose
my Lord Wrotham's house as the theatre where George's first piece should
be performed, wishing that he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) should speak to advantage, and not as when
he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) was heard by that sleepy, cynical old lady, to whom he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) had to narrate
his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) adventures.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very good and most interesting, I am sure, my dear sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bernstein/Madame de Bernstein/Madame Bernstein</b></font>)</div>says Madame
Bernstein, putting up three pretty little fingers covered with a lace
mitten, to hide a convulsive movement of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) mouth. <div class="bookquote">``And your mother
must have been delighted to see you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div><p/>George shrugged his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) shoulders ever so little, and made a low bow, as his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
aunt looked up at him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) for a moment with her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) keen old eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have been delighted to see you''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) continued drily, ``and killed the
fatted calf, and--and that kind of thing. Though why I say calf, I don't
know, nephew George, for you never were the prodigal. I may say calf to
thee, my poor Harry! Thou hast been amongst the swine sure enough. And
evil companions have robbed the money out of thy pocket and the coat off
thy back.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) came to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) family in England, madam,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>says George, with some heat,
<div class="bookquote">``and his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) friends were your ladyship's.''

 (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could not have come to worse advisers, nephew Warrington, and so I
should have told my sister earlier, had she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) condescended to write to me
by him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>), as she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) has done by you,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>said the old lady, tossing up her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) head.
<div class="bookquote">``Hey! hey!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said, at night, as she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) arranged herself for the rout to
which she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was going, to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) waiting-maid: <div class="bookquote">``this young gentleman's mother
is half sorry that he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) has come to life again, I could see that in his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
face. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) is half sorry, and I am perfectly furious! Why didn't he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
lie still when he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) dropped there under the tree, and why did that young
Florac carry him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) to the fort? I knew those Floracs when I was at Paris,
in the time of Monsieur le Regent. They were of the Floracs of Ivry. No
great house before Henri IV. His (<font color='blue'><b>Henri</b></font>) ancestor was the king's favourite.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Henri</b></font>) ancestor--he (<font color='blue'><b>Henri</b></font>)! he (<font color='blue'><b>Henri</b></font>)!--his (<font color='blue'><b>Henri</b></font>) ancestress! Brett! entendez-vous? Give me my
card-purse. I don't like the grand airs of this Monsieur George; and yet
he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) resembles, very much, his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) grandfather--the same look and sometimes
the same tones. You have heard of Colonel Esmond when I was young? This
boy has his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) eyes. I suppose I liked the Colonel's because he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) loved me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>waiting-maid</b></font>)</div><p/>Being engaged, then, to a card-party,--an amusement which she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) never
missed, week-day or Sabbath, as long as she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had strength to hold trumps
or sit in a chair,--very soon after George had ended his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) narration the
old lady dismissed her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) two nephews, giving to the elder a couple of
fingers and a very stately curtsey; but to Harry two hands and a kindly
pat on the cheek.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My poor child, now thou art disinherited, thou wilt see how differently
the world will use thee!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``There is only, in all London, a
wicked, heartless old woman who will treat thee as before. Here is a
pocket-book for you, child! Do not lose it at Ranelagh to-night. That
suit of yours does not become your brother half so well as it sat upon
you! You will present your brother to everybody, and walk up and down
the room for two hours at least, child. Were I you, I would then go to
the Chocolate-House, and play as if nothing had happened. Whilst you are
there, your brother may come back to me and eat a bit of chicken
with me. My Lady Flint gives wretched suppers, and I want to talk his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)
mother's letter over with him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>). Au revoir, gentlemen!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) went away
to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) toilette. Her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) chairmen and flambeaux were already waiting at the
door.

<p/>The gentlemen went to Ranelagh, where but a few of Mr. Harry's
acquaintances chanced to be present. They paced the round, and met Mr.
Tom Claypool with some of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) country friends; they heard the music;
they drank tea in a box; Harry was master of ceremonies, and introduced
his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) brother to the curiosities of the place; and George was even more
excited than his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) brother had been on his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) first introduction to this
palace of delight. George loved music much more than Harry ever did;
he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) heard a full orchestra for the first time, and a piece of Mr. Handel
satisfactorily performed; and a not unpleasing instance of Harry's
humility and regard for his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) elder brother was, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could even hold
George's love of music in respect at a time when fiddling was voted
effeminate and unmanly in England, and Britons were, every day, called
upon by the patriotic prints to sneer at the frivolous accomplishments
of your Squallinis, Monsieurs, and the like. Nobody in Britain is proud
of his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) ignorance now. There is no conceit left among us. There is no
such thing as dulness. Arrogance is entirely unknown... Well, at any
rate, Art has obtained her (<font color='blue'><b>Britons</b></font>) letters of naturalisation, and lives here on
terms of almost equality. If Mrs. Thrale chose to marry a music-master
now, I don't think her (<font color='blue'><b>Thrale</b></font>) friends would shudder at the mention of her (<font color='blue'><b>Thrale</b></font>) name.
If she (<font color='blue'><b>Thrale</b></font>) had a good fortune and kept a good cook, people would even go and
dine with her (<font color='blue'><b>Thrale</b></font>) in spite of the misalliance, and actually treat Mr. Piozzi
with civility.

<p/>After Ranelagh, and pursuant to Madam Bernstein's advice, George
returned to her (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>) ladyship's house, whilst Harry showed himself at the
club, where gentlemen were accustomed to assemble at night to sup, and
then to gamble. No one, of course, alluded to Mr. Warrington's little
temporary absence, and Mr. Ruff, his (<font color='blue'><b>Ruff</b></font>) ex-landlord, waited upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Ruff</b></font>) with
the utmost gravity and civility, and as if there had never been any
difference between them. Mr. Warrington had caused his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) trunks and
habiliments to be conveyed away from Bond Street in the morning, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Bond</b></font>)
and his (<font color='blue'><b>Bond</b></font>) brother were now established in apartments elsewhere.

<p/>But when the supper was done, and the gentlemen, as usual, were about to
seek the macco-table upstairs, Harry said he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was not going to play
any more. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had burned his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) fingers already, and could afford no more
extravagance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Morris/Mr. Morris</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Morris, in a rather flippant manner, <div class="bookquote">``you must have won
more than you have lost, Mr. Warrington, after all is said and done.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Morris/Mr. Morris</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And of course I don't know my own business as well as you do, Mr.
Morris,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>says Harry sternly, who had not forgotten the other's behaviour
on hearing of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) arrest; <div class="bookquote">``but I have another reason. A few months
or days ago, I was heir to a great estate, and could afford to lose
a little money. Now, thank God, I am heir to nothing.''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) looked
round, blushing not a little, to the knot of gentlemen, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) gaming
associates, who were lounging at the tables or gathered round the fire.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How do you mean, Mr. Warrington?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord</b></font>)</div>cries my Lord March, <div class="bookquote">``Have you lost
Virginia, too? Who has won it? I always had a fancy to play you myself
for that stake.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lord</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And grow an improved breed of slaves in the colony,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>says another.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The right owner has won it. You have heard me tell of my twin elder
brother?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who was killed in that affair of Braddock's two years ago! Yes.
Gracious goodness, my dear sir, I hope in heaven he (<font color='blue'><b>Braddock</b></font>) has not come to life
again?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Braddock</b></font>) arrived in London two days since. He (<font color='blue'><b>Braddock</b></font>) has been a prisoner in a French
fort for eighteen months; he (<font color='blue'><b>Braddock</b></font>) only escaped a few months ago, and left our
house in Virginia very soon after his (<font color='blue'><b>Braddock</b></font>) release.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You haven't had time to order mourning, I suppose, Mr. Warrington?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Selwyn/Selwyn</b></font>)</div>asks Mr. Selwyn very good-naturedly, and simple Harry hardly knew the
meaning of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) joke until his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) brother interpreted it to him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hang me, if I don't believe the fellow is absolutely glad of the
reappearance of his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) confounded brother!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord</b></font>)</div>cries my Lord March, as they
continued to talk of the matter when the young Virginian had taken his (<font color='blue'><b>Virginian</b></font>)
leave.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``These savages practise the simple virtues of affection--they are barely
civilised in America yet,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Selwyn/Selwyn</b></font>)</div>yawns Selwyn.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They love their kindred, and they scalp their enemies,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Walpole</b></font>)</div>simpers Mr.
Walpole. <div class="bookquote">``It's not Christian, but natural. Shouldn't you like to be
present at a scalping-match, George, and see a fellow skinned alive?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A man's elder brother is his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) natural enemy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Selwyn/Selwyn</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Selwyn, placidly
ranging his (<font color='blue'><b>Selwyn</b></font>) money and counters before him (<font color='blue'><b>Selwyn</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Torture is like broiled bones and pepper. You wouldn't relish simple
hanging afterwards, George!''  (<font color='red'><b>Horry</b></font>)</div>continues Horry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm hanged if there's any man in England who would like to see his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
elder brother alive,''  (<font color='red'><b>lord</b></font>)</div>says my lord.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, nor his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) father either, my lord!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Morris/Mr. Morris</b></font>)</div>cries Jack Morris.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``First time I ever knew you had one, Jack. Give me counters for five
hundred.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I say, `tis all mighty fine about dead brothers coming to life again,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Morris/Mr. Morris</b></font>)</div>continues Jack. <div class="bookquote">``Who is to know that it wasn't a scheme arranged between
these two fellows? Here comes a young fellow who calls himself the
Fortunate Youth, who says he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) is a Virginian Prince and the deuce knows
what, and who gets into our society--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Morris/Mr. Morris</b></font>)</div><p/>A great laugh ensues at Jack's phrase of <div class="bookquote">``our society.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Morris/Mr. Morris</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who is to know that it wasn't a cross?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Morris/Mr. Morris</b></font>)</div>Jack continues. <div class="bookquote">``The young one
is to come first. He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) is to marry an heiress, and, when he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) has got her (<font color='blue'><b>heiress</b></font>),
up is to rise the elder brother! When did this elder brother show? Why,
when the younger's scheme was blown, and all was up with him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)! Who shall
tell me that the fellow hasn't been living in Seven Dials, or in a
cellar dining off tripe and cow-heel until my younger gentleman was
disposed of? Dammy, as gentlemen, I think we ought to take notice of it:
and that this Mr. Warrington has been taking a most outrageous liberty
with the whole club.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who put him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) up? It was March, I think, put him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) up?''  (<font color='red'><b>a bystander</b></font>)</div>asks a bystander.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. But my lord thought he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) was putting up a very different person.
Didn't you, March?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hold your confounded tongue, and mind your game!''  (<font color='red'><b>the nobleman</b></font>)</div>says the nobleman
addressed: but Jack Morris's opinion found not a few supporters in the
world. Many persons agreed that it was most indecorous of Mr. Harry
Warrington to have ever believed in his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) brother's death: that there
was something suspicious about the young man's first appearance and
subsequent actions, and, in fine, that regarding these foreigners,
adventurers, and the like, we ought to be especially cautious.

<p/>Though he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) was out of prison and difficulty; though he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) had his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) aunt's
liberal donation of money in his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) pocket; though his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) dearest brother
was restored to him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>), whose return to life Harry never once thought of
deploring, as his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) friends at White's supposed he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) would do; though Maria
had shown herself in such a favourable light by her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) behaviour during
his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) misfortune: yet Harry, when alone, felt himself not particularly
cheerful, and smoked his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) pipe of Virginia with a troubled mind. It was
not that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was deposed from his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) principality; the loss of it never once
vexed him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) knew that his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) brother would share with him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) would
have done with his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) brother; but after all those struggles and doubts
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) own mind, to find himself poor, and yet irrevocably bound to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
elderly cousin! Yes, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) was elderly, there was no doubt about it. When
she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) came to that horrible den in Cursitor Street and the tears washed
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) rouge off, why, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) looked as old as his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) mother! her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) face was all
wrinkled and yellow, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) thought of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) felt just such a qualm
as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had when she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) was taken ill that day in the coach on their road
to Tunbridge. What would his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) mother say when he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) brought her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) home, and,
Lord, what battles there would be between them! He (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) would go and live on
one of the plantations--the farther from home the better--and have a
few negroes, and farm as best he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) might, and hunt a good deal; but at
Castlewood or in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) own home, such as he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) could make it for her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), what a
life for poor Maria, who had been used to go to court and to cards and
balls and assemblies every night! If he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) could be but the overseer of the
estates--oh, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) would be an honest factor, and try and make up for his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>)
useless life and extravagance in these past days! Five thousand pounds,
all his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) patrimony and the accumulations of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) long minority squandered
in six months! He (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) a beggar, except for dear George's kindness, with
nothing in life left to him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) but an old wife,--a pretty beggar, dressed
out in velvet and silver lace forsooth--the poor lad was arrayed in his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>)
best clothes--a pretty figure he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) had made in Europe, and a nice end he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>)
was come to! With all his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) fine friends at White's and Newmarket, with
all his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) extravagance, had he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) been happy a single day since he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) had been
in Europe? Yes, three days, four days, yesterday evening, when he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) had
been with dear dear Mrs. Lambert, and those affectionate kind girls, and
that brave good Colonel. And the Colonel was right when he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) rebuked him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>)
for his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) spendthrift follies, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) had been a brute to be angry as he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>)
had been, and God bless them all for their generous exertions in his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)
behalf! Such were the thoughts which Harry put into his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) pipe, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
smoked them whilst he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) waited his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) brother's return from Madame Bernstein.




<p/>CHAPTER LIV. During which Harry sits smoking his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) Pipe at Home


<p/>The maternal grandfather of our Virginians, the Colonel Esmond of whom
frequent mention has been made, and who had quitted England to reside in
the New World, had devoted some portion of his (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) long American leisure
to the composition of the memoirs of his (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) early life. In these volumes,
Madame de Bernstein -LRB-Mrs. Beatrice Esmond was her (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) name as a
spinster-RRB- played a very considerable part; and as George had read his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
grandfather's manuscript many times over, he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) had learned to know his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
kinswoman long before he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>),--to know, at least, the lady, young,
beautiful, and wilful, of half a century since, with whom he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) now became
acquainted in the decline of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) days. When cheeks are faded and eyes
are dim, is it sad or pleasant, I wonder, for the woman who is a beauty
no more, to recall the period of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) bloom! When the heart is withered,
do the old love to remember how it once was fresh and beat with warm
emotions? When the spirits are languid and weary, do we like to think
how bright they were in other days, the hope how buoyant, the sympathies
how ready, the enjoyment of life how keen and eager? So they fall--the
buds of prime, the roses of beauty, the florid harvests of summer,--fall
and wither, and the naked branches shiver in the winter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And that was a beauty once!''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>thinks George Warrington, as his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) aunt,
in her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) rouge and diamonds, comes in from her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) rout, <div class="bookquote">``and that ruin was
a splendid palace. Crowds of lovers have sighed before those decrepit
feet, and been bewildered by the brightness of those eyes.''  (<font color='red'><b>aunt</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>)
remembered a firework at home, at Williamsburg, on the King's birthday,
and afterwards looking at the skeleton-wheel and the sockets of the
exploded Roman candles. The dazzle and brilliancy of Aunt Beatrice's
early career passed before him (<font color='blue'><b>Roman</b></font>), as he (<font color='blue'><b>Roman</b></font>) thought over his (<font color='blue'><b>Roman</b></font>) grandsire's
journals. Honest Harry had seen them, too, but Harry was no bookman,
and had not read the manuscript very carefully: nay, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) would
probably not have reasoned about it as his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) brother did, being by no
means so much inclined to moralising as his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) melancholy senior.

<p/>Mr. Warrington thought that there was no cause why he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) should tell his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>)
aunt how intimate he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) was with her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) early history, and accordingly held
his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) peace upon that point. When their meal was over, she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) pointed with
her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) cane to her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) escritoire, and bade her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) attendant bring the letter
which lay under the inkstand there; and George, recognising the
superscription, of course knew the letter to be that of which he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) had
been the bearer from home.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It would appear by this letter,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>said the old lady, looking hard at her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
nephew, <div class="bookquote">``that ever since your return, there have been some differences
between you and my sister.''

 (<font color='red'><b>nephew</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed? I did not know that Madam Esmond had alluded to them,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>George
said.

<p/>The Baroness puts a great pair of glasses upon eyes which shot fire and
kindled who knows how many passions in old days, and, after glancing
over the letter, hands it to George, who reads as follows:--


<p/>``RICHMOND, VIRGINIA, December 26th, 1756.

<p/>``HONOURED MADAM! AND SISTER!--I have received, and thankfully
acknowledge, your ladyship's favour, per Rose packet, of October 23
ult.; and straightway answer you at a season which should be one of
goodwill and peace to all men: but in which Heaven hath nevertheless
decreed we should still bear our portion of earthly sorrow and trouble.
My reply will be brought to you by my eldest son, Mr. Esmond Warrington,
who returned to us so miraculously out of the Valley of the Shadow of
Death -LRB-as our previous letters have informed my poor Henry-RRB-, and who is
desirous, not without my consent to his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) wish, to visit Europe, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)
has been amongst us so short a while. I grieve to think that my dearest
Harry should have appeared at home--I mean in England--under false
colours, as it were; and should have been presented to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) Majesty, to
our family, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) own, as his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) father's heir, whilst my dear son George
was still alive, though dead to us. Ah, madam! During the eighteen
months of his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) captivity, what anguish have his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) mother's, his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) brother's,
hearts undergone! My Harry's is the tenderest of any man's now alive. In
the joy of seeing Mr. Esmond Warrington returned to life, he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) will
forget the worldly misfortune which befalls him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) will return to
-LRB-comparative-RRB- poverty without a pang. The most generous, the most
obedient of human beings, of sons, he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) will gladly give up to his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) elder
brother that inheritance which had been his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) own but for the accident of
birth, and for the providential return of my son George.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your beneficent intentions towards dearest Harry will be more than ever
welcome, now he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) is reduced to a younger brother's slender portion! Many
years since, an advantageous opportunity occurred of providing for him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
in this province, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) would by this time have been master of a noble
estate and negroes, and have been enabled to make a figure with most
here, could his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) mother's wishes have been complied with, and his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>)
father's small portion, now lying at small interest in the British
funds, have been invested in this most excellent purchase. But the forms
of the law, and, I grieve to own, my elder son's scruples, prevailed,
and this admirable opportunity was lost to me! Harry will find the
savings of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) income have been carefully accumulated--long, long may
he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) live to enjoy them! May Heaven bless you, dear sister, for what your
ladyship may add to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) little store! As I gather from your letter, that
the sum which has been allowed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) has not been sufficient for his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
expenses in the fine company which he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) has kept -LRB-and the grandson of the
Marquis of Esmond--one who had so nearly been his (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) lordship's heir--may
sure claim equality with any other nobleman in Great Britain-RRB-, and
having a sum by me which I had always intended for the poor child's
establishment, I entrust it to my eldest son, who, to do him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) justice,
hath a most sincere regard for his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) brother, to lay it out for Harry's
best advantage.''


 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It took him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) out of prison yesterday, madam. I think that was the best
use to which we could put it,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>interposed George, at this stage of his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
mother's letter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, sir, I don't know any such thing! Why not have kept it to buy
a pair of colours for him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), or to help towards another estate and some
negroes, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) has a fancy for home?''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>cried the old lady. <div class="bookquote">``Besides, I
had a fancy to pay that debt myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope you will let his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) brother do that. I ask leave to be my brother's
banker in this matter, and consider I have borrowed so much from my
mother, to be paid back to my dear Harry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you say so, sir? Give me a glass of wine! You are an extravagant
fellow! Read on, and you will see your mother thinks so. I drink to your
health, nephew George! `Tis good Burgundy. Your grandfather never loved
Burgundy. He (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) loved claret, the little he (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) drank.''

 (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div><p/>And George proceeded with the letter:


<p/><div class="bookquote">``This remittance will, I trust, amply cover any expenses which, owing to
the mistake respecting his (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) position, dearest Harry may have incurred.
I wish I could trust his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) elder brother's prudence as confidently as
my Harry's! But I fear that, even in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) captivity, Mr. Esmond W. has
learned little of that humility which becomes all Christians, and which
I have ever endeavoured to teach to my children. Should you by chance
show him (<font color='blue'><b>W.</b></font>) these lines, when, by the blessing of Heaven on those who go
down to the sea in ships, the Great Ocean divides us! he (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) will know that
a fond mother's blessing and prayers follow both her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) children, and
that there is no act I have ever done, no desire I have ever expressed
-LRB-however little he (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) may have been inclined to obey it!-RRB- but hath been
dictated by the fondest wishes for my dearest boys' welfare.''


 (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There is a scratch with a penknife, and a great blot upon the letter
there, as if water had fallen on it. Your mother writes well, George. I
suppose you and she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had a difference?''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>said George's aunt, not unkindly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, ma’am, many,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>answered the young man, sadly. <div class="bookquote">``The last was about
a question of money--of ransom which I promised to the old lieutenant of
the fort who aided me to make my escape. I told you he (<font color='blue'><b>lieutenant</b></font>) had a mistress, a
poor Indian woman, who helped me, and was kind to me. Six weeks after my
arrival at home, the poor thing made her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) appearance at Richmond, having
found her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) way through the wood by pretty much the same track which I had
followed, and bringing me the token which Museau had promised to send me
when he (<font color='blue'><b>lieutenant</b></font>) connived to my flight. A commanding officer and a considerable
reinforcement had arrived at Duquesne. Charges, I don't know of what
peculation -LRB-for his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) messenger could not express herself very clearly-RRB-,
had been brought against this Museau. He (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) had been put under arrest, and
had tried to escape; but, less fortunate than myself, he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) had been
shot on the rampart, and he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) sent the Indian woman to me, with my
grandfather's watch, and a line scrawled in his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) prison on his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) deathbed,
begging me to send ce que je scavais to a notary at Havre de Grace in
France to be transmitted to his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) relatives at Caen in Normandy. My friend
Silverheels, the hunter, had helped my poor Indian on her (<font color='blue'><b>Grace</b></font>) way. I don't
know how she (<font color='blue'><b>Grace</b></font>) would have escaped scalping else. But at home they received
the poor thing sternly. They hardly gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Grace</b></font>) a welcome. I won't say
what suspicions they had regarding her (<font color='blue'><b>Grace</b></font>) and me. The poor wretch fell to
drinking whenever she (<font color='blue'><b>Grace</b></font>) could find means. I ordered that she (<font color='blue'><b>Grace</b></font>) should have
food and shelter, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Grace</b></font>) became the jest of our negroes, and formed the
subject of the scandal and tittle-tattle of the old fools in our little
town. Our Governor was, luckily, a man of sense, and I made interest
with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and procured a pass to send her (<font color='blue'><b>Grace</b></font>) back to her (<font color='blue'><b>Grace</b></font>) people. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Grace</b></font>) very
grief at parting with me only served to confirm the suspicions against
her (<font color='blue'><b>Grace</b></font>). A fellow preached against me from the pulpit, I believe; I had
to treat another with a cane. And I had a violent dispute with Madam
Esmond--a difference which is not healed yet--because I insisted upon
paying to the heirs Museau pointed out the money I had promised for
my deliverance. You see that scandal flourishes at the borders of the
wilderness, and in the New World as well as the Old.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have suffered from it myself, my dear!''  (<font color='red'><b>Bernstein/Madame de Bernstein/Madame Bernstein</b></font>)</div>said Madame Bernstein,
demurely. <div class="bookquote">``Fill thy glass, child! A little tass of cherry-brandy! `Twill
do thee all the good in the world.''


 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``As for my poor Harry's marriage,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madam Esmond/Madam Esmond Warrington/Madam Warrington</b></font>)</div>Madam Esmond's letter went on,
``though I know too well, from sad experience, the dangers to which youth
is subject, and would keep my boy, at any price, from them, though I
should wish him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) to marry a person of rank, as becomes his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) birth, yet my
Lady Maria Esmond is out of the question. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) age is almost the same as
mine; and I know my brother Castlewood left his (<font color='blue'><b>Castlewood</b></font>) daughters with the very
smallest portions. My Harry is so obedient that I know a desire from me
will be sufficient to cause him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) to give up this imprudent match. Some
foolish people once supposed that I myself once thought of a second
union, and with a person of rank very different from ours. No! I knew
what was due to my children. As succeeding to this estate after me, Mr.
Esmond W. is amply provided for. Let my task now be to save for his (<font color='blue'><b>W.</b></font>) less
fortunate younger brother: and, as I do not love to live quite alone,
let him (<font color='blue'><b>W.</b></font>) return without delay to his (<font color='blue'><b>W.</b></font>) fond and loving mother.

<p/>``The report which your ladyship hath given of my Harry fills my heart
with warmest gratitude. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) is all indeed a mother may wish. A year in
Europe will have given him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) a polish and refinement which he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could
not acquire in our homely Virginia. Mr. Stack, one of our invaluable
ministers in Richmond, hath a letter from Mr. Ward--my darlings' tutor
of early days--who knows my Lady Warrington and her (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) excellent family,
and saith that my Harry has lived much with his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) cousins of late. I am
grateful to think that my boy has the privilege of being with his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) good
aunt. May he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) follow her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) counsels, and listen to those around him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) who
will guide him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) on the way of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) best welfare! Adieu, dear madam and
sister! For your kindness to my boy accept the grateful thanks of a
mother's heart. Though we have been divided hitherto, may these kindly
ties draw us nearer and nearer. I am thankful that you should speak of
my dearest father so. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was, indeed, one of the best of men! He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), too,
thanks you, I know, for the love you have borne to one of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) children;
and his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) daughter subscribes herself,--With sincere thanks, your
ladyship's most dutiful and grateful sister and servant, RACHEL ESMOND
WN.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``P.S.--I have communicated with my Lady Maria; but there will no need to
tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) and dear Harry that his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) mother or your ladyship hope to be able
to increase his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) small fortune. The match is altogether unsuitable.''


 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``As far as regards myself, madam,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>George said, laying down the paper,
<div class="bookquote">``my mother's letter conveys no news to me. I always knew that Harry was
the favourite son with Madam Esmond, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) deserves indeed to be. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) has
a hundred good qualities which I have not the good fortune to possess.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) has better looks--''

 (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, that is not your fault,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>said the old lady, slily looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>);
<div class="bookquote">``and, but that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) is fair and you are brown, one might almost pass for
the other.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. George bowed, and a faint blush tinged his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) pale cheek.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``His (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) disposition is bright, and mine is dark,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) continued; <div class="bookquote">``Harry
is cheerful, and I am otherwise, perhaps. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) knows how to make himself
beloved by every one, and it has been my lot to find but few friends.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My sister and you have pretty little quarrels. There were such in old
days in our family,''  (<font color='red'><b>Baroness/Baroness Bernstein/Bernstein</b></font>)</div>the Baroness said; <div class="bookquote">``and if Madam Esmond takes after
our mother--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Baroness/Baroness Bernstein/Bernstein</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My mother has always described hers as an angel upon earth,''  (<font color='red'><b>Baroness/Baroness Bernstein/Bernstein</b></font>)</div>interposed
George.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Eh! That is a common character for people when they are dead!''  (<font color='red'><b>Baroness/Baroness Bernstein/Bernstein</b></font>)</div>cried
the Baroness; <div class="bookquote">``and Rachel Castlewood was an angel, if you like--at least
your grandfather thought so. But let me tell you, sir, that angels are
sometimes not very commodes a vivre. It may be they are too good to live
with us sinners, and the air down below here don't agree with them. My
poor mother was so perfect that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) never could forgive me for being
otherwise. Ah, mon Dieu! how she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) used to oppress me with those angelical
airs!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Baroness/Baroness Bernstein/Bernstein</b></font>)</div><p/>George cast down his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) eyes, and thought of his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) own melancholy youth.
He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) did not care to submit more of his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) family secrets to the cynical
inquisition of this old worldling, who seemed, however, to understand
him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) in spite of his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) reticence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I quite comprehend you, sir, though you hold your tongue,''  (<font color='red'><b>Baroness/Baroness Bernstein/Bernstein</b></font>)</div>the Baroness
continued. <div class="bookquote">``A sermon in the morning: a sermon at night: and two or three
of a Sunday. That is what people call being good. Every pleasure cried
fie upon; all us worldly people excommunicated; a ball an abomination of
desolation; a play a forbidden pastime; and a game of cards perdition!
What a life! Mon Dieu, what a life!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We played at cards every night, if we were so inclined,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>said George,
smiling; <div class="bookquote">``and my grandfather loved Shakspeare so much, that my mother
had not a word to say against her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) father's favourite author.''

 (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I remember. He (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) could say whole pages by heart; though, for my part,
I like Mr. Congreve a great deal better. And then, there was that
dreadful, dreary Milton, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Milton</b></font>) and Mr. Addison pretended to admire!''
 (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>cried the old lady, tapping her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) fan.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If your ladyship does not like Shakspeare, you will not quarrel with
my mother for being indifferent to him (<font color='blue'><b>Shakspeare</b></font>), too,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>said George. <div class="bookquote">``And indeed I
think, and I am sure, that you don't do her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) justice. Wherever there are

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) doses them with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) horrible purges and boluses!''  (<font color='red'><b>the Baroness</b></font>)</div>cried the

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) does her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) best to cure them!

duty as far as she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) knows it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't blame you, sir, for doing yours, and keeping your own counsel
about Madam Esmond,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>said the old lady. <div class="bookquote">``But at least there is one
point upon which we all three agree--that this absurd marriage must be
prevented. Do you know how old the woman is? I can tell you, though she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My mother has not forgotten her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) cousin's age, and is shocked at the
disparity between her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) and my poor brother. Indeed, a city-bred lady of
her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) time of life, accustomed to London gaiety and luxury, would find but
a dismal home in our Virginian plantation. Besides, the house, such as
it is, is not Harry's. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) is welcome there, Heaven knows; more welcome,
perhaps, than I, to whom the property comes in natural reversion; but,
as I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), I doubt how his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wife would--would like our colony,''
 (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>George said, with a blush, and a hesitation in his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) sentence.

<p/>The old lady laughed shrilly. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)! nephew Warrington!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said,
<div class="bookquote">``you need not scruple to speak your mind out. I shall tell no tales to
your mother: though `tis no news to me that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) has a high temper, and
loves her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) own way. Harry has held his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) tongue, too; but it needed no
conjurer to see who was the mistress at home, and what sort of a life
my sister led you. I love my niece, my Lady Molly, so well, that I could
wish her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) two or three years of Virginia, with your mother reigning over
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). You may well look alarmed, sir! Harry has said quite enough to show
me who governs the family.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Madam,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>said George, smiling, <div class="bookquote">``I may say as much as this, that I don't
envy any woman coming into our house against my mother's will: and my
poor brother knows this perfectly well.''

 (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What? You two have talked the matter over? No doubt you have. And the
foolish child considers himself bound in honour--of course he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) does, the
gaby!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) says Lady Maria has behaved most nobly to him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>). When he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) was sent to
prison, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) brought him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) trinkets and jewels, and every guinea she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>)
had in the world. This behaviour has touched him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) so, that he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) feels more
deeply than ever bound to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) ladyship. But I own my brother seems bound
by honour rather than love--such at least is his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) present feeling.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My good creature,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bernstein/Madame de Bernstein/Madame Bernstein</b></font>)</div>cries Madame Bernstein, <div class="bookquote">``don't you see that Maria
brings a few twopenny trinkets and a half-dozen guineas to Mr. Esmond,
the heir of the great estate in Virginia,--not to the second son, who is
a beggar, and has just squandered away every shilling of his (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>) fortune?
I swear to you, on my credit as a gentlewoman, that, knowing Harry's
obstinacy, and the misery he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had in store for himself, I tried to bribe
Maria to give up her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) engagement with him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), and only failed because I
could not bribe high enough! When he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was in prison, I sent my lawyer to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), with orders to pay his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) debts immediately, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) would but part from
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>), but Maria had been beforehand with us, and Mr. Harry chose not to
go back from his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) stupid word. Let me tell you what has passed in the
last month!''  (<font color='red'><b>Bernstein/Madame de Bernstein/Madame Bernstein</b></font>)</div>And here the old lady narrated at length the history which
we know already, but in that cynical language which was common in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
times, when the finest folks and the most delicate ladies called things
and people by names which we never utter in good company nowadays. And
so much the better on the whole. We mayn't be more virtuous, but it
is something to be more decent: perhaps we are not more pure, but of a
surety we are more cleanly.

<p/>Madame Bernstein talked so much, so long, and so cleverly, that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was
quite pleased with herself and her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) listener; and when she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) put herself
into the hands of Mrs. Brett to retire for the night, informed the
waiting-maid that she (<font color='blue'><b>Brett</b></font>) had changed her (<font color='blue'><b>Brett</b></font>) opinion about her (<font color='blue'><b>Brett</b></font>) eldest nephew,
and that Mr. George was handsome, that he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) was certainly much wittier
than poor Harry -LRB-whom Heaven, it must be confessed, had not furnished
with a very great supply of brains-RRB-, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had quite the bel
air--a something melancholy--a noble and distinguished je ne scais
quoy--which reminded her (<font color='blue'><b>Brett</b></font>) of the Colonel. Had she (<font color='blue'><b>Brett</b></font>) ever told Brett about
the Colonel? Scores of times, no doubt. And now she (<font color='blue'><b>Brett</b></font>) told Brett about the
Colonel once more. Meanwhile, perhaps, her (<font color='blue'><b>Brett</b></font>) new favourite was not quite
so well pleased with her (<font color='blue'><b>Brett</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>Brett</b></font>) was with him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>). What a strange picture of
life and manners had the old lady unveiled to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) nephew! How she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) railed
at all the world round about her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)! How unconsciously did she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) paint her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
own family--her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) own self; how selfish, one and all; pursuing what
mean ends; grasping and scrambling frantically for what petty prizes;
ambitious for what shabby recompenses; trampling--from life's beginning
to its close--through what scenes of stale dissipations and faded
pleasures! <div class="bookquote">``Are these the inheritors of noble blood?''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>thought George, as
he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) went home quite late from his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) aunt's house, passing by doors whence
the last guests of fashion were issuing, and where the chairmen were
yawning over their expiring torches. <div class="bookquote">``Are these the proud possessors of
ancestral honours and ancient names, and were their forefathers, when in
life, no better? We have our pedigree at home with noble coats-of-arms
emblazoned all over the branches, and titles dating back before the
Conquest and the Crusaders. When a knight of old found a friend in want,
did he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) turn his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) back upon him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>), or an unprotected damsel, did he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) delude
her (<font color='blue'><b>damsel</b></font>) and leave her (<font color='blue'><b>damsel</b></font>)? When a nobleman of the early time received a young
kinsman, did he (<font color='blue'><b>kinsman</b></font>) get the better of him (<font color='blue'><b>kinsman</b></font>) at dice, and did the ancient
chivalry cheat in horseflesh? Can it be that this wily woman of the
world, as my aunt has represented, has inveigled my poor Harry into an
engagement, that her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) tears are false, and that as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) finds him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
poor she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) will desert him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)? Had we not best pack the trunks and take a
cabin in the next ship bound for home?''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>George reached his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) own door
revolving these thoughts, and Gumbo came up yawning with a candle, and
Harry was asleep before the extinguished fire, with the ashes of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
emptied pipe on the table beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>).

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) starts up; his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) eyes, for a moment dulled by sleep, lighten with
pleasure as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) sees his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) dear George. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) puts his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) arm round his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) brother
with a boyish laugh.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) is in flesh and blood, thank God!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) says; <div class="bookquote">``I was dreaming of
thee but now, George, and that Ward was hearing us our lesson! Dost
thou remember the ruler, Georgy? Why, bless my soul, `tis three o’clock!
Where have you been a-gadding, Mr. George? Hast thou supped? I supped at
White's, but I'm hungry again. I did not play, sir,--no, no; no more of
that for younger brothers! And my Lord March paid me fifty he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) lost to
me. I bet against his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) horse and on the Duke of Hamilton's! They both
rode the match at Newmarket this morning, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) lost because he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) was
under weight. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) paid me, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) was as sulky as a bear. Let us have
one pipe, Georgy!--just one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And after the smoke the young men went to bed, where I, for one, wish
them a pleasant rest, for sure it is a good and pleasant thing to see
brethren who love one another.




<p/>CHAPTER LV. Between Brothers


<p/>Of course our young men had had their private talk about home, and all
the people and doings there, and each had imparted to the other full
particulars of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) history since their last meeting. How were Harry's
dogs, and little Dempster, and good old Nathan, and the rest of the
household? Was Mountain well, and Fanny grown to be a pretty girl? So
Parson Broadbent's daughter was engaged to marry Tom Barker of Savannah,
and they were to go and live in Georgia! Harry owns that at one period
he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was very sweet upon Parson Broadbent's daughter, and lost a
great deal of pocket-money at cards, and drank a great quantity of
strong-waters with the father, in order to have a pretext for being near
the girl. But, Heaven help us! Madam Esmond would never have consented
to his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) throwing himself away upon Polly Broadbent. So Colonel G.
Washington's wife was a pretty woman, very good-natured and pleasant,
and with a good fortune? He (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) had brought her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) into Richmond, and paid a
visit of state to Madam Esmond. George described, with much humour, the
awful ceremonials at the interview between these two personages, and the
killing politeness of his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) mother to Mr. Washington's young wife. <div class="bookquote">``Never
mind, George, my dear!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Mountain/Mountain</b></font>)</div>says Mrs. Mountain. <div class="bookquote">``The Colonel has taken
another wife, but I feel certain that at one time two young gentlemen I
know of ran a very near chance of having a tall stepfather six feet two
in his (<font color='blue'><b>stepfather</b></font>) boots.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Mountain/Mountain</b></font>)</div>To be sure, Mountain was for ever match-making in her (<font color='blue'><b>Mountain</b></font>)
mind. Two people could not play a game at cards together, or sit down
to a dish of tea, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Mountain</b></font>) fancied their conjunction was for life. It was
she (<font color='blue'><b>Mountain</b></font>)--the foolish tattler--who had set the report abroad regarding the
poor Indian woman. As for Madam Esmond, she (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) had repelled the insinuation
with scorn when Parson Stack brought it to her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>), and said, <div class="bookquote">``I should as
soon fancy Mr. Esmond stealing the spoons, or marrying a negro woman
out of the kitchen.''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>But, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) disdained to find the poor Biche
guilty, and even thanked her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) for attending her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) son in his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) illness, she (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>)
treated her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) with such a chilling haughtiness of demeanour, that the
Indian slunk away into the servants' quarters, and there tried to drown
her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) disappointments with drink. It was not a cheerful picture that which
George gave of his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) two months at home. <div class="bookquote">``The birthright is mine, Harry,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``but thou art the favourite, and God help me! I think my mother
almost grudges it to me. Why should I have taken the pas, and preceded
your worship into the world? Had you been the eider, you would have had
the best cellar, and ridden the best nag, and been the most popular
man in the country, whereas I have not a word to say for myself, and
frighten people by my glum face: I should have been second son, and set
up as lawyer, or come to England and got my degrees, and turned parson,
and said grace at your honour's table. The time is out of joint, sir. O
cursed spite, that ever I was born to set it right!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, Georgy, you are talking verses, I protest you are!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>says Harry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think, my dear, some one else talked those verses before me,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>says
George, with a smile.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's out of one of your books. You know every book that ever was wrote,
that I do believe!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>cries Harry, and then told his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) brother how he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) had
seen the two authors at Tunbridge, and how he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) had taken off his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) hat to
them. <div class="bookquote">``Not that I cared much about their books, not being clever enough.
But I remembered how my dear old George used to speak of `em,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>says
Harry, with a choke in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) voice, <div class="bookquote">``and that's why I liked to see them. I
say, dear, it's like a dream seeing you over again. Think of that bloody
Indian with his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) knife at my George's head! I should like to give that
Monsieur de Florac something for saving you--but I haven't got much now,
only my little gold knee-buckles, and they ain't worth two guineas.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You have got the half of what I have, child, and we'll divide as soon
as I have paid the Frenchman,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>George said.

<p/>On which Harry broke out not merely into blessings but actual
imprecations, indicating his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) intense love and satisfaction; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) swore
that there never was such a brother in the world as his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) brother George.
Indeed, for some days after his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) brother's arrival his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) eyes followed
George about: he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) would lay down his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) knife and fork, or his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) newspaper,
when they were sitting together, and begin to laugh to himself. When he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
walked with George on the Mall or in Hyde Park, he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) would gaze round at
the company, as much as to say, <div class="bookquote">``Look here, gentlemen! This is he (<font color='blue'><b>Frenchman</b></font>).
This is my brother, that was dead and is alive again! Can any man in
Christendom produce such a brother as this?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Of course he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) was of opinion that George should pay to Museau's heirs
the sum which he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) had promised for his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) ransom. This question had been the
cause of no small unhappiness to poor George at home. Museau dead, Madam
Esmond argued with much eagerness, and not a little rancour, the bargain
fell to the ground, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) son was free. The man was a rogue in the
first instance. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) would not pay the wages of iniquity. Mr. Esmond had
a small independence from his (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) father, and might squander his (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) patrimony
if he (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) chose. He (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) was of age, and the money was in his (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) power; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>)
would be no party to such extravagance, as giving twelve thousand livres
to a parcel of peasants in Normandy with whom we were at war, and who
would very likely give it all to the priests and the pope. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) would not
subscribe to any such wickedness. If George wanted to squander away his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
father's money -LRB-she (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) must say that formerly he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) had not been so eager,
and when Harry's benefit was in question had refused to touch a penny of
it!-RRB---if he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wished to spend it now, why not give it to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) own flesh and
blood, to poor Harry, who was suddenly deprived of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) inheritance, and
not to a set of priest-ridden peasants in France? This dispute had raged
between mother and son during the whole of the latter's last days
in Virginia. It had never been settled. On the morning of George's
departure, Madam Esmond had come to his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) bedside after a sleepless night,
and asked him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) whether he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) still persisted in his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) intention to fling away
his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) father's property?

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) replied in a depth of grief and perplexity, that his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) word was passed,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) must do as his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) honour bade him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) answered that she (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) would
continue to pray that Heaven might soften his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) proud heart, and enable
her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) to bear her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) heavy trials: and the last view George had of his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
mother's face was as she (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) stood yet a moment by his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) bedside, pale and
with tearless eyes, before she (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) turned away and slowly left his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) chamber.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where didst thou learn the art of winning over everybody to thy side,
Harry?''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>continued George; ``and how is it that you and all the world
begin by being friends? Teach me a few lessons in popularity, nay,
I don't know that I will have them; and when I find and hear certain
people hate me, I think I am rather pleased than angry. At first, at
Richmond, Mr. Esmond Warrington, the only prisoner who had escaped from
Braddock's field--the victim of so much illness and hardship--was a
favourite with the town-folks, and received privately and publicly with
no little kindness. The parson glorified my escape in a sermon; the
neighbours came to visit the fugitive; the family coach was ordered out,
and Madam Esmond and I paid our visits in return. I think some pretty
little caps were set at me. But these our mother routed off, and
frightened with the prodigious haughtiness of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) demeanour; and my
popularity was already at the decrease before the event occurred which
put the last finishing stroke to it. I was not jolly enough for the
officers, and didn't care for their drinking-bouts, dice-boxes, and
swearing. I was too sarcastic for the ladies, and their tea and tattle
stupefied me almost as much as the men's blustering and horse-talk. I
cannot tell thee, Harry, how lonely I felt in that place, amidst the
scandal and squabbles: I regretted my prison almost, and found myself
more than once wishing for the freedom of thought, and the silent ease
of Duquesne. I am very shy, I suppose: I can speak unreservedly to very
few people. Before most, I sit utterly silent. When we two were at home,
it was thou who used to talk at table, and get a smile now and then from
our mother. When she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) and I were together we had no subject in common,
and we scarce spoke at all until we began to dispute about law and
divinity.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So the gentlemen had determined I was supercilious, and a dull
companion -LRB-and, indeed, I think their opinion was right-RRB-, and the ladies
thought I was cold and sarcastic,--could never make out whether I was
in earnest or no, and, I think, generally voted I was a disagreeable
fellow, before my character was gone quite away; and that went with the
appearance of the poor Biche. Oh, a nice character they made for me, my
dear!''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>cried George, in a transport of wrath, <div class="bookquote">``and a pretty life they
led me after Museau's unlucky messenger had appeared amongst us! The
boys hooted the poor woman if she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) appeared in the street; the ladies
dropped me half-curtseys, and walked over to the other side. That
precious clergyman went from one tea-table to another preaching on the
horrors of seduction, and the lax principles which young men learned in
popish countries and brought back thence. The poor Fawn's appearance
at home a few weeks after my return home, was declared to be a scheme
between her (<font color='blue'><b>Fawn</b></font>) and me; and the best informed agreed that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fawn</b></font>) had waited on
the other side of the river until I gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Fawn</b></font>) the signal to come and
join me in Richmond. The officers bantered me at the coffee-house, and
cracked their clumsy jokes about the woman I had selected. Oh, the world
is a nice charitable world! I was so enraged that I thought of going to
Castlewood and living alone there,--for our mother finds the place dull,
and the greatest consolation in precious Mr. Stack's ministry,--when
the news arrived of your female perplexity, and I think we were all glad
that I should have a pretext for coming to Europe.''

 (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should like to see any of the infernal scoundrels who said word
against you, and break their rascally bones,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>roars out Harry, striding
up and down the room.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I had to do something like it for Bob Clubber.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What! that little sneaking, backbiting, toad-eating wretch, who is
always hanging about my lord at Greenway Court, and spunging on every
gentleman in the country? If you whipped him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>), I hope you whipped him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
well, George?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We were bound over to keep the peace; and I offered to go into Maryland
with him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) and settle our difference there, and of course the good folk
said, that having made free with the seventh commandment I was inclined
to break the sixth. So, by this and by that--and being as innocent of
the crime imputed to me as you are--I left home, my dear Harry, with as
awful a reputation as ever a young gentleman earned.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Ah, what an opportunity is there here to moralise! If the esteemed
reader and his (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) humble servant could but know--could but write down in
a book--could but publish, with illustrations, a collection of the
lies which have been told regarding each of us since we came to man's
estate,--what a harrowing and thrilling work of fiction that romance
would be! Not only is the world informed of everything about you, but
of a great deal more. Not long since the kind postman brought a paper
containing a valuable piece of criticism, which stated--<div class="bookquote">``This author
states he (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) was born in such and such a year. It is a lie. He (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) was born in
the year so and so.''  (<font color='red'><b>the kind postman</b></font>)</div>The critic knew better: of course he (<font color='blue'><b>critic</b></font>) did. Another
-LRB-and both came from the country which gave MULLIGAN birth-RRB- warned some
friend, saying, <div class="bookquote">``Don't speak of New South Wales to him (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) has a brother
there, and the family never mention his (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) name.''  (<font color='red'><b>some friend</b></font>)</div>But this subject is too
vast and noble for a mere paragraph. I shall prepare a memoir, or let
us have rather, par une societe de gens de lettres, a series of
biographies, of lives of gentlemen, as told by their dear friends whom
they don't know.

<p/>George having related his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) exploits as champion and martyr, of course
Harry had to unbosom himself to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) brother, and lay before his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) elder
an account of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) private affairs. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) gave up all the family of
Castlewood--my lord, not for getting the better of him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) at play; for
Harry was a sporting man, and expected to pay when he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) lost, and receive
when he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) won; but for refusing to aid the chaplain in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) necessity, and
dismissing him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) with such false and heartless pretexts. About Mr. Will he (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>)
had made up his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) mind, after the horse-dealing matter, and freely
marked his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) sense of the latter's conduct upon Mr. Will's eyes and nose.
Respecting the Countess and Lady Fanny, Harry spoke in a manner more
guarded, but not very favourable. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had heard all sorts of stories
about them. The Countess was a card-playing old cat; Lady Fanny was a
desperate flirt. Who told him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)? Well, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had heard the stories from a
person who knew them both very well indeed. In fact, in those days
of confidence, of which we made mention in the last volume, Maria had
freely imparted to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) cousin a number of anecdotes respecting her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>)
stepmother and her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) half-sister, which were by no means in favour of
those ladies.

<p/>But in respect to Lady Maria herself, the young man was staunch and
hearty. <div class="bookquote">``It may be imprudent: I don't say no, George. I may be a fool:
I think I am. I know there will be a dreadful piece of work at home, and
that Madam and she (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) will fight. Well! we must live apart. Our estate is
big enough to live on without quarrelling, and I can go elsewhere than
to Richmond or Castlewood. When you come to the property, you'll give me
a bit--at any rate, Madam will let me off at an easy rent--or I'll make
a famous farmer or factor. I can't and won't part from Maria. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) has
acted so nobly by me, that I should be a rascal to turn my back on her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>).
Think of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) bringing me every jewel she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) had in the world, dear
brave creature! and flinging them into my lap with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) last
guineas,--and--and--God bless her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>Here Harry dashed his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) sleeve across
his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) eyes, with a stamp of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) foot, and said, <div class="bookquote">``No, brother, I won't part
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>)--not to be made Governor of Virginia tomorrow; and my dearest
old George would never advise me to do so, I know that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sent here to advise you,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>George replied. <div class="bookquote">``I am sent to break the
marriage off, if I can: and a more unhappy one I can't imagine. But I
can't counsel you to break your word, my boy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I knew you couldn't! What's said is said, George. I have made my bed,
and must lie on it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Harry/Mr. Harry Warrington</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Harry, gloomily.

<p/>Such had been the settlement between our two young worthies, when
they first talked over Mr. Harry's love affair. But after George's
conversation with his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) aunt, and the further knowledge of his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) family,
which he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) acquired through the information of that keen old woman of the
world, Mr. Warrington, who was naturally of a sceptical turn, began to
doubt about Lady Maria, as well as regarding her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) brothers and sister,
and looked at Harry's engagement with increased distrust and alarm. Was
it for his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wealth that Maria wanted Harry? Was it his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) handsome young
person that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) longed after? Were those stories true which Aunt
Bernstein had told of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>)? Certainly he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could not advise Harry to
break his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) word; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) might cast about in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) mind for some scheme for
putting Maria's affection to the trial; and his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) ensuing conduct, which
appeared not very amiable, I suppose resulted from this deliberation.




<p/>CHAPTER LVI. Ariadne


<p/>My Lord Castlewood had a house in Kensington Square spacious enough to
accommodate the several members of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) noble family, and convenient for
their service at the palace hard by, when his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) Majesty dwelt there. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>)
ladyship had her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) evenings, and gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) card-parties here for such as
would come; but Kensington was a long way from London a hundred years
since, and George Selwyn said he (<font color='blue'><b>Selwyn</b></font>) for one was afraid to go, for fear
of being robbed of a night,--whether by footpads with crape over their
faces, or by ladies in rouge at the quadrille-table, we have no means of
saying. About noon on the day after Harry had made his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) reappearance at
White's, it chanced that all his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) virtuous kinsfolks partook of breakfast
together, even Mr. Will being present, who was to go into waiting in the
afternoon.

<p/>The ladies came first to their chocolate: them Mr. Will joined in his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>)
court suit; finally, my lord appeared, languid, in his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) bedgown and
nightcap, having not yet assumed his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) wig for the day. Here was news
which Will had brought home from the Star and Garter last night, when he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>)
supped in company with some men who had heard it at White's and seen it
at Ranelagh!

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Heard what? seen what?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>asked the head of the house, taking up his (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>)
Daily Advertiser.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ask Maria!''  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Lady Fanny</b></font>)</div>says Lady Fanny. My lord turns to his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) elder sister, who
wears a face of portentous sadness, and looks as pale as a tablecloth.

<p/>```Tis one of Will's usual elegant and polite inventions,'' says Maria.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>swore Will, with several of his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) oaths; <div class="bookquote">``it was no invention of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Heard</b></font>). Tom Claypool of Norfolk saw `em both at Ranelagh; and Jack Morris
came out of White's, where he (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>) heard the story from Harry Warrington's
own lips. Curse him (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>), I'm glad of it!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>roars Will, slapping the table.
<div class="bookquote">``What do you think of your Fortunate Youth, your Virginian, whom your
lordship made so much of, turning out to be a second son?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The elder brother not dead?''  (<font color='red'><b>lord</b></font>)</div>says my lord.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No more dead than you are. Never was. It's my belief that it was a

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Warrington is incapable of such duplicity!''  (<font color='red'><b>Maria/Lady Maria/Lady Maria Esmond</b></font>)</div>cries Maria.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I never encouraged the fellow, I am sure you will do me justice there,''

and lost his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) estate!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And here he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) turned towards his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) sister Maria, who,
although she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) looked the picture of woe, must have suggested something
ludicrous to the humourist near whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) sate; for his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) lordship, having
gazed at her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) for a minute, burst into a shrill laugh, which caused the
poor lady's face to flush, and presently her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) eyes to pour over with
tears. <div class="bookquote">``It's a shame! it's a shame!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) sobbed out, and hid her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) face
in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) handkerchief. Maria's stepmother and sister looked at each other.
<div class="bookquote">``We never quite understand your lordship's humour,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>the former lady
remarked, gravely.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't see there is the least reason why you should,''  (<font color='red'><b>lord</b></font>)</div>said my lord,
coolly. <div class="bookquote">``Maria, my dear, pray excuse me if I have said--that is, done
anything, to hurt your feelings.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Done anything! You pillaged the poor lad in his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) prosperity, and laugh
at him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) ruin!''  (<font color='red'><b>Maria/Lady Maria/Lady Maria Esmond</b></font>)</div>says Maria, rising from table, and glaring round at
all her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) family.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Excuse me, my dear sister, I was not laughing at him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>lord</b></font>)</div>said my lord,
gently.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, never mind at what or whom else, my lord! You have taken from him (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>)
all he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) had to lose. All the world points at you as the man who feeds on
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own flesh and blood. And now you have his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) all, you make merry over
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) misfortune!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And away she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) rustled from the room, flinging looks of
defiance at all the party there assembled.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell us what has happened, or what you have heard, Will, and my
sister's grief will not interrupt us.''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>And Will told, at great length,
and with immense exultation at Harry's discomfiture, the story now
buzzed through all London, of George Warrington's sudden apparition.
Lord Castlewood was sorry for Harry: Harry was a good, brave lad, and
his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) kinsman liked him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), as much as certain worldly folks like each other.
To be sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) played Harry at cards, and took the advantage of the
market upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>); but why not? The peach which other men would certainly
pluck, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) might as well devour. Eh! if that were all my conscience had
to reproach me with, I need not be very uneasy! my lord thought. <div class="bookquote">``Where
does Mr. Warrington live?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Will expressed himself ready to enter upon a state of reprobation if he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>)
knew or cared.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) shall be invited here, and treated with every respect,''  (<font color='red'><b>lord</b></font>)</div>said my
lord.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Including piquet, I suppose!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>growls Will.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Or will you take him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) to the stables, and sell him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) one of your bargains
of horseflesh, Will?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord</b></font>)</div>asks Lord Castlewood. <div class="bookquote">``You would have won of Harry
Warrington fast enough, if you could; but you cheat so clumsily at your
game that you got paid with a cudgel. I desire, once more, that every
attention may be paid to our cousin Warrington.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And that you are not to be disturbed, when you sit down to play, of
course, my lord!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady</b></font>)</div>cries Lady Castlewood.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Madam, I desire fair play, for Mr. Warrington, and for myself, and
for every member of this amiable family,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord</b></font>)</div>retorted Lord Castlewood,
fiercely.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Heaven help the poor gentleman if your lordship is going to be kind to
him (<font color='blue'><b>lordship</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>the stepmother</b></font>)</div>said the stepmother, with a curtsey; and there is no knowing
how far this family dispute might have been carried, had not, at this
moment, a phaeton driven up to the house, in which were seated the two
young Virginians.

<p/>It was the carriage which our young Prodigal had purchased in the days
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Prodigal</b></font>) prosperity. He (<font color='blue'><b>Prodigal</b></font>) drove it still: George sate in it by his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) side;
their negroes were behind them. Harry had been for meekly giving the
whip and reins to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) brother, and ceding the whole property to him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``What business has a poor devil like me with horses and carriages,
Georgy?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>Harry had humbly said. <div class="bookquote">``Beyond the coat on my back, and
the purse my aunt gave me, I have nothing in the world. You take
the driving-seat, brother; it will ease my mind if you will take the
driving-seat.''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>George laughingly said he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) did not know the way, and Harry
did; and that, as for the carriage, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) would claim only a half of it,
as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had already done with his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) brother's wardrobe. <div class="bookquote">``But a bargain is
a bargain; if I share thy coats, thou must divide my breeches' pocket,
Harry; that is but fair dealing!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>Again and again Harry swore there
never was such a brother on earth. How he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) rattled his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) horses over the
road! How pleased and proud he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was to drive such a brother! They came
to Kensington in famous high spirits; and Gumbo's thunder upon Lord
Castlewood's door was worthy of the biggest footman in all St. James's.

<p/>Only my Lady Castlewood and her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) daughter Lady Fanny were in the room
into which our young gentlemen were ushered. Will had no particular
fancy to face Harry, my lord was not dressed, Maria had her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) reasons
for being away, at least till her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) eyes were dried. When we drive up to
friends' houses nowadays in our coaches-and-six, when John carries up
our noble names, when, finally, we enter the drawing-room with our
best hat and best Sunday smile foremost, does it ever happen that we
interrupt a family row! that we come simpering and smiling in, and
stepping over the delusive ashes of a still burning domestic heat? that
in the interval between the hall-door and the drawing-room, Mrs., Mr.,
and the Misses Jones have grouped themselves in a family tableau;
this girl artlessly arranging flowers in a vase, let us say; that one
reclining over an illuminated work of devotion; mamma on the sofa, with
the butcher's and grocer's book pushed under the cushion, some elegant
work in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) hand, and a pretty little foot pushed out advantageously;
while honest Jones, far from saying, <div class="bookquote">``Curse that Brown, he (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) is always
calling here!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jones/Tom Jones</b></font>)</div>holds out a kindly hand, shows a pleased face, and
exclaims, <div class="bookquote">``What, Brown my boy, delighted to see you! Hope you've come
to lunch!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I say, does it ever happen to us to be made the victims of
domestic artifices, the spectators of domestic comedies got up for our
special amusement? Oh, let us be thankful, not only for faces, but
for masks! not only for honest welcome, but for hypocrisy, which hides
unwelcome things from us! Whilst I am talking, for instance, in this
easy, chatty way, what right have you, my good sir, to know what is
really passing in my mind? It may be that I am racked with gout, or
that my eldest son has just sent me in a thousand pounds' worth of
college-bills, or that I am writhing under an attack of the Stoke Pogis
Sentinel, which has just been sent me under cover, or that there is a
dreadfully scrappy dinner, the evident remains of a party to which I
didn't invite you, and yet I conceal my agony, I wear a merry smile; I
say, <div class="bookquote">``What! come to take pot-luck with us, Brown my boy! Betsy! put a
knife and fork for Mr. Brown. Eat! Welcome! Fall to! It's my best!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I
say that humbug which I am performing is beautiful self-denial--that
hypocrisy is true virtue. Oh, if every man spoke his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mind what an
intolerable society ours would be to live in!

<p/>As the young gentlemen are announced, Lady Castlewood advances towards
them with perfect ease and good-humour. <div class="bookquote">``We have heard, Harry,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>)
says, looking at the latter with a special friendliness, <div class="bookquote">``of this most
extraordinary circumstance. My Lord Castlewood said at breakfast that he (<font color='blue'><b>Castlewood</b></font>)
should wait on you this very day, Mr. Warrington, and, cousin Harry, we
intend not to love you any the less because you are poor.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We shall be able to show now that it is not for your acres that we like
you, Harry!''  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Lady Fanny</b></font>)</div>says Lady Fanny, following her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) mamma's lead.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And I to whom the acres have fallen?''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>says Mr. George, with a smile and
a bow.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, cousin, we shall like you for being like Harry!''  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Lady Fanny</b></font>)</div>replies the arch
Lady Fanny.

<p/>Ah! who that has seen the world, has not admired that astonishing ease
with which fine ladies drop you and pick you up again? Both the ladies
now addressed themselves almost exclusively to the younger brother. They
were quite civil to Mr. George: but with Mr. Harry they were fond, they
were softly familiar, they were gently kind, they were affectionately
reproachful. Why had Harry not been for days and days to see them?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Better to have had a dish of tea and a game at piquet with them than
with some other folks,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady</b></font>)</div>says Lady Castlewood. <div class="bookquote">``If we had won enough
to buy a paper of pins from you we should have been content; but young
gentlemen don't know what is for their own good,''  (<font color='red'><b>mamma</b></font>)</div>says mamma.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now you have no more money to play with, you can come and play with
us, cousin!''  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Lady Fanny</b></font>)</div>cries fond Lady Fanny, lifting up a finger, <div class="bookquote">``and so your
misfortune will be good fortune to us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Lady Fanny</b></font>)</div><p/>George was puzzled. This welcome of his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) brother was very different from
that to which he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) had looked. All these compliments and attentions paid
to the younger brother, though he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) was without a guinea! Perhaps the
people were not so bad as they were painted? The Blackest of all Blacks
is said not to be of quite so dark a complexion as some folks describe
him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>).

<p/>This affectionate conversation continued for some twenty minutes, at the
end of which period my Lord Castlewood made his (<font color='blue'><b>Castlewood</b></font>) appearance, wig on head,
and sword by side. He (<font color='blue'><b>Castlewood</b></font>) greeted both the young men with much politeness:
one not more than the other. <div class="bookquote">``If you were to come to us--and I, for one,
cordially rejoice to see you--what a pity it is you did not come a few
months earlier! A certain evening at piquet would then most likely never
have taken place. A younger son would have been more prudent.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, indeed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>said Harry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Or a kinsman more compassionate. But I fear that love of play runs in
the blood of all of us. I have it from my father, and it has made me the
poorest peer in England. Those fair ladies whom you see before you are
not exempt. My poor brother Will is a martyr to it; and what I, for my
part, win on one day, I lose on the next. `Tis shocking, positively, the
rage for play in England. All my poor cousin's bank-notes parted company
from me within twenty-four hours after I got them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have played, like other gentlemen, but never to hurt myself, and
never indeed caring much for the sport,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>remarked Mr. Warrington.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``When we heard that my lord had played with Harry, we did so scold him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>),''
 (<font color='red'><b>the ladies</b></font>)</div>cried the ladies.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But if it had not been I, thou knowest, cousin Warrington, some other
person would have had thy money. `Tis a poor consolation, but as such
Harry must please to take it, and be glad that friends won his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) money,
who wish him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) well, not strangers, who cared nothing for him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), and fleeced
him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Eh! a tooth out is a tooth out, though it be your brother who pulls it,
my lord!''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>said Mr. George, laughing. <div class="bookquote">``Harry must bear the penalty of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
faults, and pay his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) debts, like other men.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sure I have never said or thought otherwise. `Tis not like an
Englishman to be sulky because he (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) is beaten,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>says Harry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your hand, cousin! You speak like a man!''  (<font color='red'><b>lord</b></font>)</div>cries my lord, with delight.
The ladies smiled to each other.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My sister, in Virginia, has known how to bring up her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) sons as
gentlemen!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Castlewood</b></font>)</div>exclaims Lady Castlewood, enthusiastically.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I protest you must not be growing so amiable now you are poor, cousin
Harry!''  (<font color='red'><b>cousin</b></font>)</div>cries cousin Fanny. <div class="bookquote">``Why, mamma, we did not know half his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) good
qualities when he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was only Fortunate Youth and Prince of Virginia! You
are exactly like him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>), cousin George, but I vow you can't be as amiable
as your brother!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am the Prince of Virginia, but I fear I am not the Fortunate Youth,''
 (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>said George, gravely.

<p/>Harry was beginning, <div class="bookquote">``By Jove, he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) is the best--''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>when the noise of a
harpsichord was heard from the upper room. The lad blushed: the ladies
smiled.

<p/>```Tis Maria, above,'' said Lady Castlewood. <div class="bookquote">``Let some of us go up to
her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>The ladies</b></font>)</div><p/>The ladies rose, and made way towards the door; and Harry followed
them, blushing very much. George was about to join the party, but Lord
Castlewood checked him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Nay, if all the ladies follow your brother''
 (<font color='red'><b>lordship</b></font>)</div>his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) lordship said, <div class="bookquote">``let me at least have the benefit of your company and
conversation. I long to hear the account of your captivity and rescue,
cousin George!''

 (<font color='red'><b>lordship</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, we must hear that too!''  (<font color='red'><b>the ladies</b></font>)</div>cried one of the ladies, lingering.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am greedy, and should like it all by myself,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Castlewood/Castlewood</b></font>)</div>said Lord Castlewood,
looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) very sternly; and followed the women to the door, and
closed it upon them with a low bow.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your brother has no doubt acquainted you with the history of all
that has happened to him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) in this house, cousin George?''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>asked George's
kinsman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, including the quarrel with Mr. Will and the engagement to my Lady
Maria,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>replies George, with a bow. <div class="bookquote">``I may be pardoned for saying that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) hath met with but ill fortune here, my lord.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Which no one can deplore more cordially than myself. My brother lives
with horse jockeys and trainers, and the wildest bloods of the town,
and between us there is very little sympathy. We should not all live
together, were we not so poor. This is the house which our grandmother
occupied before she (<font color='blue'><b>grandmother</b></font>) went to America and married Colonel Esmond. Much
of the furniture belonged to her (<font color='blue'><b>grandmother</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>George looked round the wainscoted
parlour with some interest. <div class="bookquote">``Our house has not flourished in the last
twenty years; though we had a promotion of rank a score of years since,
owing to some interest we had at court, then. But the malady of play has
been the ruin of us all. I am a miserable victim to it: only too
proud to sell myself and title to a roturiere, as many noblemen, less
scrupulous, have done. Pride is my fault, my dear cousin. I remember how
I was born!''  (<font color='red'><b>lordship</b></font>)</div>And his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) lordship laid his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) hand on his (<font color='blue'><b>lordship</b></font>) shirt-frill, turned
out his (<font color='blue'><b>lordship</b></font>) toe, and looked his (<font color='blue'><b>lordship</b></font>) cousin nobly in the face.

<p/>Young George Warrington's natural disposition was to believe everything
which everybody said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>). When once deceived, however, or undeceived
about the character of a person, he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) became utterly incredulous, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) saluted this fine speech of my lord's with a sardonical, inward
laughter, preserving his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) gravity, however, and scarce allowing any of
his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) scorn to appear in his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) words.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We have all our faults, my lord. That of play hath been condoned over
and over again in gentlemen of our rank. Having heartily forgiven my
brother, surely I cannot presume to be your lordship's judge in the
matter; and instead of playing and losing, I wish sincerely that you had
both played and won!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So do I, with all my heart!''  (<font color='red'><b>lord</b></font>)</div>says my lord with a sigh. <div class="bookquote">``I augur
well for your goodness when you can speak in this way, and for your
experience and knowledge of the world, too, cousin, of which you seem to
possess a greater share than most young men of your age. Your poor Harry
hath the best heart in the world; but I doubt whether his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) head be very
strong.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not very strong, indeed. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hath the art to make friends wherever
he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) goes, and in spite of all his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) imprudences most people love him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do--we all do, I'm sure! as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) were our brother!''  (<font color='red'><b>lord</b></font>)</div>cries my lord.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) has often described in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) letters his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) welcome at your lordship's
house. My mother keeps them all, you may be sure. Harry's style is not
very learned, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) heart is so good, that to read him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) is better than
wit.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I may be mistaken, but I fancy his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) brother possesses a good heart and a
good wit, too!''  (<font color='red'><b>lord</b></font>)</div>says my lord, obstinately gracious.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am as Heaven made me, cousin; and perhaps some more experience and
sorrow than has fallen to the lot of most young men.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``This misfortune of your poor brother--I mean this piece of good
fortune, your sudden reappearance--has not quite left Harry without
resources?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord</b></font>)</div>continued Lord Castlewood, very gently.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``With nothing but what his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) mother can leave him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), or I, at her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) death,
can spare him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). What is the usual portion here of a younger brother, my
lord?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Eh! a younger brother here is--you know--in fine, everybody knows what
a younger brother is,''  (<font color='red'><b>lord</b></font>)</div>said my lord, and shrugged his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) shoulders and
looked his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) guest in the face.

<p/>The other went on: <div class="bookquote">``We are the best of friends, but we are flesh and
blood: and I don't pretend to do more for him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) than is usually done for
younger brothers. Why give him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) money? That he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) should squander it at
cards or horse-racing? My lord, we have cards and jockeys in Virginia,
too; and my poor Harry hath distinguished himself in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) own country
already, before he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) came to yours. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) inherits the family failing for
dissipation.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Poor fellow, poor fellow, I pity him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Our estate, you see, is great, but our income is small. We have little
more money than that which we get from England for our tobacco--and very
little of that too--for our tobacco comes back to us in the shape of
goods, clothes, leather, groceries, ironmongery, nay, wine and beer for
our people and ourselves. Harry may come back and share all these:
there is a nag in the stable for him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), a piece of venison on the table,
a little ready money to keep his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) pocket warm, and a coat or two every
year. This will go on whilst my mother lives, unless, which is far from
improbable, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) gets into some quarrel with Madam Esmond. Then, whilst I
live he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) will have the run of the house and all it contains: then, if I
die leaving children, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) will be less and less welcome. His (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) future,
my lord, is a dismal one, unless some strange piece of luck turn up on
which we were fools to speculate. Henceforth he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) is doomed to dependence,
and I know no worse lot than to be dependent on a self-willed woman like
our mother. The means he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had to make himself respected at home he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
hath squandered away here. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) has flung his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) patrimony to the dogs,
and poverty and subserviency are now his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) only portion.''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>Mr. Warrington
delivered this speech with considerable spirit and volubility, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>)
cousin heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) respectfully.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You speak well, Mr. Warrington. Have you ever thought of public life?''
 (<font color='red'><b>lord</b></font>)</div>said my lord.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course I have thought of public life like every man of my
station--every man, that is, who cares for something beyond a dice-box
or a stable,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>replies George. <div class="bookquote">``I hope, my lord, to be able to take my
own place, and my unlucky brother must content himself with his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>). This I
say advisedly, having heard from him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) of certain engagements which he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) has
formed, and which it would be misery to all parties were he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) to attempt
to execute now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Your logic is very strong,''  (<font color='red'><b>lord</b></font>)</div>said my lord. <div class="bookquote">``Shall we go up and see the
ladies? There is a picture above-stairs which your grandfather is said
to have executed. Before you go, my dear cousin, you will please to fix
a day when our family may have the honour of receiving you. Castlewood,
you know, is always your home when we are there. It is something like
your Virginian Castlewood, cousin, from your account. We have beef,
and mutton, and ale, and wood, in plenty; but money is woefully scarce
amongst us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the ladies</b></font>)</div><p/>They ascended to the drawing-room, where, however, they found only one
of the ladies of the family. This was my Lady Maria, who came out of the
embrasure of a window, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) and Harry Warrington had been engaged
in talk.

<p/>George made his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) best bow, Maria her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) lowest curtsey. <div class="bookquote">``You are indeed
wonderfully like your brother,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) said, giving him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) hand. <div class="bookquote">``And from
what he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) says, cousin George, I think you are as good as he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) is.''

 (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div><p/>At the sight of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) swollen eyes and tearful face George felt a pang
of remorse. <div class="bookquote">``Poor thing!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) thought. <div class="bookquote">``Harry has been vaunting my
generosity and virtue to her (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), and I have beer, playing the selfish elder
brother downstairs! How old she (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) looks! How could he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) ever have a passion
for such a woman as that?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>How? Because he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) did not see with your eyes,
Mr. George. He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) saw rightly too now with his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) own, perhaps. I never know
whether to pity or congratulate a man on coming to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) senses.

<p/>After the introduction a little talk took place, which for a while Lady
Maria managed to carry on in an easy manner: but though ladies in this
matter of social hypocrisy are, I think, far more consummate performers
than men, after a sentence or two the poor lady broke out into a sob,
and, motioning Harry away with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) hand, fairly fled from the room.

<p/>Harry was rushing forward, but stopped--checked by that sign. My lord
said his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) poor sister was subject to these fits of nerves, and had
already been ill that morning. After this event our young gentlemen
thought it was needless to prolong their visit. Lord Castlewood followed
them downstairs, accompanied them to the door, admired their nags in the
phaeton, and waved them a friendly farewell.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And so we have been coaxing and cuddling in the window, and we part
good friends, Harry? Is it not so?''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>says George to his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) charioteer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is a good woman!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>cries Harry, lashing the horses. <div class="bookquote">``I know
you'll think so when you come to know her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``When you take her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) home to Virginia? A pretty welcome our mother will
give her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) will never forgive me for not breaking the match off, nor
you for making it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't help it, George! Don't you be popping your ugly head so close
to my ears, Gumbo! After what has passed between us, I am bound in
honour to stand by her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). If she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) sees no objection, I must find none. I
told her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) all. I told her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) that Madam would be very rusty at first; but
that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was very fond of me, and must end by relenting. And when you
come to the property, I told her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) that I knew my dearest George so well,
that I might count upon sharing with him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The deuce you did! Let me tell you, my dear, that I have been telling
my Lord Castlewood quite a different story. That as an elder brother I
intend to have all my rights--there, don't flog that near horse so--and
that you can but look forward to poverty and dependence.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What! You won't help me?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>cries Harry, turning quite pale.

<p/>``George, I don't believe it, though I hear it out of your own mouth!
There was a minute's pause after this outbreak, during which Harry did
not even look at his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) brother, but sate, gazing blindly before him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), the
picture of grief and gloom. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was driving so near to a road-post that
the carriage might have been upset but for George's pulling the rein.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You had better take the reins, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>said Harry. <div class="bookquote">``I told you you had
better take them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did you ever know me fail you, Harry?''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>George asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said the other, <div class="bookquote">``not till now'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--the tears were rolling down his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
cheeks as he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) spoke.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear, I think one day you will say I have done my duty.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``What have you done? asked Harry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have said you were a younger brother--that you have spent all your
patrimony, and that your portion at home must be very slender. Is it not
true?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, but I would not have believed it, if ten thousand men had told
me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>said Harry. <div class="bookquote">``Whatever happened to me, I thought I could trust you,
George Warrington.''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>And in this frame of mind Harry remained during the
rest of the drive.

<p/>Their dinner was served soon after their return to their lodgings, of
which Harry scarce ate any, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) drank freely of the wine before
him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That wine is a bad consoler in trouble, Harry,''  (<font color='red'><b>brother</b></font>)</div>his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) brother remarked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have no other, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>said Harry, grimly; and having drunk glass after
glass in silence, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) presently seized his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hat, and left the room.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) did not return for three hours. George, in much anxiety about his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
brother, had not left home meanwhile, but read his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) book, and smoked the
pipe of patience. <div class="bookquote">``It was shabby to say I would not aid him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), and,
God help me, it was not true. I won't leave him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), though he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) marries a
blackamoor,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>thought George <div class="bookquote">``have I not done him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) harm enough already, by
coming to life again? Where has he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) gone; has he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) gone to play?''

 (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good God! what has happened to thee?''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>cried George Warrington,
presently, when his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) brother came in, looking ghastly pale.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) came up and took his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) brother's hand. <div class="bookquote">``I can take it now, Georgy,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) said. ``Perhaps what you did was right, though. I for one will never
believe that you would throw your brother off in distress. I'll tell you
what. At dinner, I thought suddenly, I'll go back to her (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) and speak to
her (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>). I'll say to her (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), `Maria, poor as I am, your conduct to me has been
so noble, that, by heaven! I am yours to take or to leave. If you will
have me, here I am: I will enlist: I will work: I will try and make a
livelihood for myself somehow, and my bro--my relations will relent,
and give us enough to live on.' That's what I determined to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>);
and I did, George. I ran all the way to Kensington in the rain--look, I
am splashed from head to foot,--and found them all at dinner, all except
Will, that is. I spoke out that very moment to them all, sitting round
the table, over their wine. `Maria,' says I, `a poor fellow wants to
redeem his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) promise which he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) made when he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) fancied he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) was rich. Will you
take him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)?' I found I had plenty of words, and didn't hem and stutter as
I'm doing now. I spoke ever so long, and I ended by saying I would do my
best and my duty by her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>), so help me God!

<p/><div class="bookquote">``When I had done, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) came up to me quite kind. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) took my hand, and
kissed it before the rest. `My dearest, best Harry!' she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) said -LRB-those
were her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) words, I don't want otherwise to be praising myself-RRB-, `you are
a noble heart, and I thank you with all mine. But, my dear, I have long
seen it was only duty, and a foolish promise made by a young man to an
old woman, that has held you to your engagement. To keep it would make
you miserable, my dear. I absolve you from it, thanking you with all my
heart for your fidelity, and blessing and loving my dear cousin always.'
And she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) came up and kissed me before them all, and went out of the
room quite stately, and without a single tear. They were all crying,
especially my lord, who was sobbing quite loud. I didn't think he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) had so
much feeling. And she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), George? Oh, isn't she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) a noble creature?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Here's her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) health!''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>cries George, filling one of the glasses that still
stood before him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hip, hip, huzzay!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>says Harry. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was wild with delight at being free.




<p/>CHAPTER LVII. In which Mr. Harry's Nose continues to be put out of joint


<p/>Madame de Bernstein was scarcely less pleased than her (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) Virginian
nephews at the result of Harry's final interview with Lady Maria. George
informed the Baroness of what had passed, in a billet which he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) sent
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) the same evening; and shortly afterwards her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) nephew Castlewood,
whose visits to his (<font color='blue'><b>Castlewood</b></font>) aunt were very rare, came to pay his (<font color='blue'><b>Castlewood</b></font>) respects to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>), and frankly spoke about the circumstances which had taken place;
for no man knew better than my Lord Castlewood how to be frank upon
occasion, and now that the business between Maria and Harry was ended
what need was there of reticence or hypocrisy? The game had been played,
and was over: he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had no objection now to speak of its various
moves, stratagems, finesses. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is my own sister,''  (<font color='red'><b>lord</b></font>)</div>said my lord,
affectionately; <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) won't have many more chances--many more such
chances of marrying and establishing herself. I might not approve of the
match in all respects, and I might pity your ladyship's young Virginian
favourite: but of course such a piece of good fortune was not to be
thrown away, and I was bound to stand by my own flesh and blood.''

 (<font color='red'><b>lord</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Your candour does your lordship honour,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bernstein/Madame de Bernstein/Madame Bernstein</b></font>)</div>says Madame de Bernstein, <div class="bookquote">``and
your love for your sister is quite edifying!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Bernstein/Madame de Bernstein/Madame Bernstein</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, we have lost the game, and I am speaking sans rancune. It is not
for you, who have won, to bear malice,''  (<font color='red'><b>lord</b></font>)</div>says my lord, with a bow.

<p/>Madame de Bernstein protested she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) was never in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) life in better
humour. <div class="bookquote">``Confess, now, Eugene, that visit of Maria to Harry at the
spunging-house--that touching giving up of all his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) presents to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>), was
a stroke of thy invention?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pity for the young man, and a sense of what was due from Maria to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>)
friend--her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) affianced lover--in misfortune, sure these were motives
sufficient to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) act as she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) did,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord</b></font>)</div>replies Lord Castlewood,
demurely.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But `twas you advised her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>), my good nephew?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Castlewood, with a shrug of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) shoulders, owned that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) did advise his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>)
sister to see Mr. Henry Warrington. <div class="bookquote">``But we should have won, in spite
of your ladyship,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) continued, <div class="bookquote">``had not the elder brother made his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)
appearance. And I have been trying to console my poor Maria by showing
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) what a piece of good fortune it is after all, that we lost.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Suppose she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) had married Harry, and then cousin George had made his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
appearance?''  (<font color='red'><b>remarks the Baroness</b></font>)</div>remarks the Baroness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Effectivement,''  (<font color='red'><b>Eugene</b></font>)</div>cries Eugene, taking snuff. ``As the grave was to give
up its dead, let us be thankful to the grave for disgorging in time! I
am bound to say, that Mr. George Warrington seems to be a man of sense,
and not more selfish than other elder sons and men of the world. My poor
Molly fancied that he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) might be a--what shall I say?--a greenhorn perhaps
is the term--like his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) younger brother. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) fondly hoped that he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) might be
inclined to go share and share alike with Twin junior; in which case, so
infatuated was she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) about the young fellow, that I believe she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) would have
taken him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>). `Harry Warrington, with half a loaf, might do very well,'
says I, `but Harry Warrington with no bread, my dear!'''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How no bread?''  (<font color='red'><b>the Baroness</b></font>)</div>asks the Baroness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, no bread except at his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) brother's side-table. The elder said as
much.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What a hard-hearted wretch!''  (<font color='red'><b>Bernstein/Madame de Bernstein/Madame Bernstein</b></font>)</div>cries Madame de Bernstein.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, bah! I play with you, aunt, cartes sur table! Mr. George only did
what everybody else would do; and we have no right to be angry with him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>),
really we haven't. Molly herself acknowledged as much, after her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) first
burst of grief was over, and I brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) to listen to reason. The
silly old creature! to be so wild about a young lad at her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) time of
life!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>```Twas a real passion, I almost do believe,'' said Madame de Bernstein.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You should have heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) take leave of him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>). C’etait touchant, ma
parole d’honneur! I cried. Before George, I could not help myself. The
young fellow with muddy stockings, and his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) hair about his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) eyes, flings
himself amongst us when we were at dinner; makes his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) offer to Molly in a
very frank and noble manner, and in good language too; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) replies.
Begad, it put me in mind of Mrs. Woffington in the new Scotch play, that
Lord Bute's man has wrote--Douglas--what d’ye call it? She (<font color='blue'><b>Woffington</b></font>) clings round
the lad: she (<font color='blue'><b>Woffington</b></font>) bids him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) adieu in heartrending accents. She (<font color='blue'><b>Woffington</b></font>) steps out of
the room in a stately despair--no more chocolate, thank you. If she (<font color='blue'><b>Woffington</b></font>) had
made a mauvais pas no one could retire from it with more dignity. `Twas
a masterly retreat after a defeat. We were starved out of our position,
but we retired with all the honours of war.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Molly won't die of the disappointment!''  (<font color='red'><b>lord</b></font>)</div>said my lord's aunt, sipping
her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) cup.

<p/>My lord snarled a grin, and showed his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) yellow teeth. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>)
said, <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) hath once or twice before had the malady very severely, and
recovered perfectly. It don't kill, as your ladyship knows, at Molly's
age.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>How should her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) ladyship know? She (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) did not marry Doctor Tusher until she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>)
was advanced in life. She (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) did not become Madame de Bernstein until still
later. Old Dido, a poet remarks, was not ignorant of misfortune, and
hence learned to have compassion on the wretched.

<p/>People in the little world, as I have been told, quarrel and fight, and
go on abusing each other, and are not reconciled for ever so long. But
people in the great world are surely wiser in their generation. They
have differences; they cease seeing each other. They make it up and come
together again, and no questions are asked. A stray prodigal, or a stray
puppy-dog, is thus brought in under the benefit of an amnesty, though
you know he (<font color='blue'><b>people</b></font>) has been away in ugly company. For six months past, ever
since the Castlewoods and Madame de Bernstein had been battling for
possession of poor Harry Warrington, these two branches of the Esmond
family had remained apart. Now, the question being settled, they were
free to meet again, as though no difference ever had separated them: and
Madame de Bernstein drove in her (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>) great coach to Lady Castlewood's rout,
and the Esmond ladies appeared smiling at Madame de Bernstein's drums,
and loved each other just as much as they previously had done.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So, sir, I hear you have acted like a hard-hearted monster about your
poor brother Harry!''  (<font color='red'><b>Baroness/Baroness Bernstein/Bernstein</b></font>)</div>says the Baroness, delighted, and menacing George
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) stick.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I acted but upon your ladyship's hint, and desired to see whether it
was for himself or his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) reputed money that his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) kinsfolk wanted to have
him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>replies George, turning rather red.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, Maria could not marry a poor fellow who was utterly penniless, and
whose elder brother said he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) would give him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) nothing!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I did it for the best, madam,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>says George, still blushing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And so thou didst, O thou hypocrite!''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>cries the old lady.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hypocrite, madam! and why?''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>asks Mr. Warrington, drawing himself up in
much state.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I know all, my infant!''  (<font color='red'><b>the Baroness</b></font>)</div>says the Baroness in French. <div class="bookquote">``Thou art very
like thy grandfather. Come, that I embrace thee! Harry has told me all,
and that thou hast divided thy little patrimony with him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It was but natural, madam. We have had common hearts and purses since
we were born. I but feigned hard-heartedness in order to try those
people yonder,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>says George, with filling eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And thou wilt divide Virginia with him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) too?''  (<font color='red'><b>Bernstein/Madame de Bernstein/Madame Bernstein</b></font>)</div>asks the Bernstein.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't say so. It were not just,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>replied Mr. Warrington. <div class="bookquote">``The land
must go to the eldest born, and Harry would not have it otherwise: and
it may be I shall die, or my mother outlive the pair of us. But half of
what is mine is his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>): and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), it must be remembered, only was extravagant
because he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was mistaken as to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) position.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But it is a knight of old, it is a Bayard, it is the grandfather
come to life!''  (<font color='red'><b>Bernstein/Madame de Bernstein/Madame Bernstein</b></font>)</div>cried Madame de Bernstein to her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) attendant, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) was
retiring for the night. And that evening, when the lads left her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>), it was
to poor Harry she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) gave the two fingers, and to George the rouged cheek,
who blushed, for his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) part, almost as deep as that often-dyed rose, at
such a mark of his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) old kinswoman's favour.

<p/>Although Harry Warrington was the least envious of men, and did honour
to his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) brother as in all respects his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) chief, guide, and superior, yet no
wonder a certain feeling of humiliation and disappointment oppressed the
young man after his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) deposition from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eminence as Fortunate Youth and
heir to boundless Virginian territories. Our friends at Kensington might
promise and vow that they would love him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) all the better after his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fall;
Harry made a low bow and professed himself very thankful; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
could not help perceiving, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) went with his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) brother to the state
entertainment with which my Lord Castlewood regaled his (<font color='blue'><b>Castlewood</b></font>) new-found
kinsman, that George was all in all to his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) cousins: had all the talk,
compliments, and petits soins for himself, whilst of Harry no one took
any notice save poor Maria, who followed him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) with wistful looks, pursued
him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) with eyes conveying dismal reproaches, and, as it were, blamed him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
because she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) had left him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Ah!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>the eyes seemed to say, ```tis mighty
well of you, Harry, to have accepted the freedom which I gave you; but I
had no intention, sir, that you should be so pleased at being let off.''
She (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) up, but yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) did not quite forgive him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) for taking her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>)
at her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) word. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) would not have him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), and yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) would. Oh, my young
friends, how delightful is the beginning of a love-business, and how
undignified, sometimes, the end! What a romantic vista is before young
Damon and young Phillis -LRB-or middle-aged ditto ditto-RRB- when, their artless
loves made known to each other, they twine their arms round each other's
waists and survey that charming pays du tendre which lies at their feet!
Into that country, so linked together, they will wander from now until
extreme old age. There may be rocks and roaring rivers, but will not
Damon's strong true love enable him (<font color='blue'><b>Damon</b></font>) to carry Sweetheart over them? There
may be dragons and dangers in the path, but shall not his (<font color='blue'><b>Damon</b></font>) courageous
sword cut them down? Then at eve, how they will rest cuddled together,
like two pretty babes in the wood, the moss their couch, the stars their
canopy, their arms their mutual pillows! This is the wise plan young
folks make when they set out on the love journey; and--O me!--they have
not got a mile when they come to a great wall and find they must walk
back again. They are squabbling with the post-boy at Barnet -LRB-the first
stage on the Gretna Road, I mean-RRB-, and, behold, perhaps Strephon has not
got any money, or here is papa with a whacking horsewhip, who takes Miss
back again, and locks her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) up crying in the schoolroom. The parting
is heart-breaking; but, when she (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) has married the banker and had eight
children, and he (<font color='blue'><b>banker</b></font>) has become, it may be, a prosperous barrister,--it may
be, a seedy raff who has gone twice or thrice into the Gazette; when,
I say, in after years Strephon and Delia meet again, is not the meeting
ridiculous? Nevertheless, I hope no young man will fall in love, having
any doubt in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mind as to the eternity of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) passion. `Tis when a
man has had a second or third amorous attack that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) begins to grow
doubtful; but some women are romantic to the end, and from eighteen to
eight-and-fifty -LRB-for what I know-RRB- are always expecting their hearts to
break. In fine, when you have been in love and are so no more, when the
King of France, with twenty thousand men, with colours flying, music
playing, and all the pomp of war, having marched up the hill, then
proceeds to march down again, he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) and you are in an absurd position.

<p/>This is what Harry Warrington, no doubt, felt when he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) went to Kensington
and encountered the melancholy, reproachful eyes of his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) cousin. Yes! it
is a foolish position to be in; but it is also melancholy to look into
a house you have once lived in, and see black casements and emptiness
where once shone the fires of welcome. Melancholy? Yes; but, ha! how
bitter, how melancholy, how absurd to look up as you pass sentimentally
by No. 13, and see somebody else grinning out of window, and evidently
on the best terms with the landlady. I always feel hurt, even at an inn
which I frequent, if I see other folks' trunks and boots at the doors
of the rooms which were once mine. Have those boots lolled on the sofa
which once I reclined on? I kick you from before me, you muddy, vulgar
highlows!

<p/>So considering that his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) period of occupation was over, and Maria's
rooms, if not given up to a new tenant, were, at any rate, to let, Harry
did not feel very easy in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) cousin's company, nor she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) possibly in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>).
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) found either that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had nothing to say to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>), or that what she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) had
to say to him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was rather dull and commonplace, and that the red lip of
a white-necked pipe of Virginia was decidedly more agreeable to him (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) now
than Maria's softest accents and most melancholy moue. When George went
to Kensington, then, Harry did not care much about going, and pleaded
other engagements.

<p/>At his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) uncle's house in Hill Street the poor lad was no better amused,
and, indeed, was treated by the virtuous people there with scarce any
attention at all. The ladies did not scruple to deny themselves when
he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) came; he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) could scarce have believed in such insincerity after their
caresses, their welcome, their repeated vows of affection; but happening
to sit with the Lamberts for an hour after he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) had called upon his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) aunt,
he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) ladyship's chairmen arrive with an empty chair, and his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) aunt
step out and enter the vehicle, and not even blush when he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) made her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) a
bow from the opposite window. To be denied by his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) own relations--to have
that door which had opened to him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) so kindly, slammed in his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) face! He (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>)
would not have believed such a thing possible, poor simple Harry said.
Perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) thought the door-knocker had a tender heart, and was not made
of brass; not more changed than the head of that knocker was my Lady
Warrington's virtuous face when she (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) passed her (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) nephew.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My father's own brother's wife! What have I done to offend her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)? Oh,
Aunt Lambert, Aunt Lambert, did you ever see such cold-heartedness?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>cries out Harry, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) usual impetuosity.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do we make any difference to you, my dear Harry?''  (<font color='red'><b>Aunt Lambert</b></font>)</div>says Aunt Lambert,
with a side look at her (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) youngest daughter. <div class="bookquote">``The world may look coldly at
you, but we don't belong to it: so you may come to us in safety.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In this house you are different from other people,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>replies Harry. <div class="bookquote">``I
don't know how, but I always feel quiet and happy somehow when I come to
you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Quis me uno vivit felicior? aut magis hac est
Optandum vita dicere quis potuit?''

 (<font color='red'><b>General</b></font>)</div><p/>calls out General Lambert. <div class="bookquote">``Do you know where I got these verses, Mr.
Gownsman?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) addresses his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) son from college, who is come to pass
an Easter holiday with his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) parents. <div class="bookquote">``You got them out of Catullus, sir,''
 (<font color='red'><b>the scholar</b></font>)</div>says the scholar.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I got them out of no such thing, sir. I got them out of my favourite
Democritus Junior--out of old Burton, who has provided many indifferent
scholars with learning;''  (<font color='red'><b>Montaigne</b></font>)</div>and who and Montaigne, were favourite authors
with the good General.




<p/>CHAPTER LVIII. Where we do what Cats may do


<p/>We have said how our Virginians, with a wisdom not uncommon in
youth, had chosen to adopt strong Jacobite opinions, and to profess a
prodigious affection for the exiled royal family. The banished prince
had recognised Madam Esmond's father as Marquis of Esmond, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) did
not choose to be very angry with an unfortunate race, that, after all,
was so willing to acknowledge the merits of her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) family. As for any
little scandal about her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) sister, Madame de Bernstein, and the Old
Chevalier, she (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) tossed away from her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) with scorn the recollection of that
odious circumstance, asserting, with perfect truth, that the two first
monarchs of the House of Hanover were quite as bad as any Stuarts in
regard to their domestic morality. But the king de facto was the king,
as well as his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) Majesty de jure. De Facto had been solemnly crowned and
anointed at church, and had likewise utterly discomfited De Jure, when
they came to battle for the kingdom together. Madam's clear opinion was,
then, that her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) sons owed it to themselves as well as the sovereign to
appear at his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) royal court. And if his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) Majesty should have been minded
to confer a lucrative post, or a blue or red ribbon upon either of them,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>), for her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) part, would not have been in the least surprised. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) made
no doubt but that the King knew the Virginian Esmonds as well as any
other members of his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) nobility. The lads were specially commanded, then,
to present themselves at court, and, I dare say, their mother would have
been very angry had she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) known that George took Harry's laced coat on the
day when he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) went to make his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) bow at Kensington.

<p/>A hundred years ago the King's drawing-room was open almost every day
to his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) nobility and gentry; and loyalty--especially since the war had
begun--could gratify itself a score of times in a month with the august
sight of the sovereign. A wise avoidance of the enemy's ships of war, a
gracious acknowledgment of the inestimable loss the British Isles would
suffer by the seizure of the royal person at sea, caused the monarch to
forgo those visits to his (<font color='blue'><b>monarch</b></font>) native Hanover which were so dear to his (<font color='blue'><b>monarch</b></font>)
royal heart, and compelled him (<font color='blue'><b>monarch</b></font>) to remain, it must be owned, unwillingly
amongst his (<font color='blue'><b>monarch</b></font>) loving Britons. A Hanoverian lady, however, whose virtues
had endeared her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) to the prince, strove to console him (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) for his (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) enforced
absence from Herrenhausen. And from the lips of the Countess of Walmoden
-LRB-on whom the imperial beneficence had gracefully conferred a high title
of British honour-RRB- the revered Defender of the Faith could hear the
accents of his (<font color='blue'><b>Defender</b></font>) native home.

<p/>To this beloved Sovereign, Mr. Warrington requested his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) uncle, an
assiduous courtier, to present him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>); and as Mr. Lambert had to go
to court likewise, and thank his (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) Majesty for his (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) promotion, the
two gentlemen made the journey to Kensington together, engaging a
hackney-coach for the purpose, as my Lord Wrotham's carriage was now
wanted by its rightful owner, who had returned to his (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) house in town.
They alighted at Kensington Palace Gate, where the sentries on duty knew
and saluted the good General, and hence modestly made their way on foot
to the summer residence of the sovereign. Walking under the portico
of the Palace, they entered the gallery which leads to the great black
marble staircase -LRB-which hath been so richly decorated and painted by Mr.
Kent-RRB-, and then passed through several rooms, richly hung with tapestry
and adorned with pictures and bustos, until they came to the King's
great drawing-room, where that famous <div class="bookquote">``Venus''  (<font color='red'><b>the King</b></font>)</div>by Titian is, and, amongst
other masterpieces, the picture of <div class="bookquote">``St. Francis adoring the infant
Saviour,''  (<font color='red'><b>Titian</b></font>)</div>performed by Sir Peter Paul Rubens; and here, with the rest of
the visitors to the court, the gentlemen waited until his (<font color='blue'><b>Rubens</b></font>) Majesty issued
from his (<font color='blue'><b>Rubens</b></font>) private apartments, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Rubens</b></font>) was in conference with certain
personages who were called in the newspaper language of that day his (<font color='blue'><b>Rubens</b></font>)
M-j-ty's M-n-st-rs.

<p/>George Warrington, who had never been in a palace before, had leisure to
admire the place, and regard the people round him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) saw fine pictures
for the first time too, and I dare say delighted in that charming piece
of Sir Athony Vandyck, representing King Charles the First, his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) Queen
and Family, and the noble picture of <div class="bookquote">``Esther before Ahasuerus,''  (<font color='red'><b>Queen Family</b></font>)</div>painted
by Tintoret, and in which all the figures are dressed in the magnificent
Venetian habit. With the contemplation of these works he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) was so
enraptured, that he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) scarce heard all the remarks of his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) good friend the
General, who was whispering into his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) young companion's almost heedless
ear the names of some of the personages round about them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yonder,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lambert</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Lambert, ``are two of my Lords of the Admiralty, Mr.
Gilbert Elliot and Admiral Boscawen: your Boscawen, whose fleet fired
the first gun in your waters two years ago. That stout gentleman all
belated with gold is Mr. Fox, that was Minister, and is now content to
be Paymaster with a great salary.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Minister</b></font>) carries the auri fames on his (<font color='blue'><b>Minister</b></font>) person. Why, his (<font color='blue'><b>Minister</b></font>) waistcoat is a
perfect Potosi!''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>says George.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Aliena appetens--how goes the text? He (<font color='blue'><b>Minister</b></font>) loves to get money and to spend
it,''  (<font color='red'><b>General</b></font>)</div>continues General Lambert. <div class="bookquote">``Yon is my Lord Chief Justice Willes,
talking to my Lord of Salisbury, Doctor Headley, who, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Headley</b></font>) serve
his (<font color='blue'><b>Headley</b></font>) God as he (<font color='blue'><b>Headley</b></font>) serves his (<font color='blue'><b>Headley</b></font>) King, will be translated to some very high
promotion in Heaven. He (<font color='blue'><b>Headley</b></font>) belongs to your grandfather's time, and was
loved by Dick Steele and hated by the Dean. With them is my Lord of
London, the learned Doctor Sherlock. My lords of the lawn sleeves have
lost half their honours now. I remember when I was a boy in my mother's
hand, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) made me go down on my knees to the Bishop of Rochester; him (<font color='blue'><b>Bishop</b></font>)
who went over the water, and became Minister to somebody who shall be
nameless--Perkin's Bishop. That handsome fair man is Admiral Smith. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
was president of poor Byng's court-martial, and strove in vain to get
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) off his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) penalty; Tom of Ten Thousand they call him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) in the fleet. The
French Ambassador had him (<font color='blue'><b>Ambassador</b></font>) broke, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Ambassador</b></font>) was a lieutenant, for making a
French man-of-war lower topsails to him (<font color='blue'><b>Ambassador</b></font>), and the King made Tom a
captain the next day. That tall, haughty-looking man is my Lord George
Sackville, who, now I am a Major-General myself, will treat me somewhat
better than a footman. I wish my stout old Blakeney were here; he (<font color='blue'><b>footman</b></font>) is the
soldier's darling, and as kind and brave as yonder poker of a nobleman
is brave and--I am your lordship's very humble servant. This is a young
gentleman who is just from America, and was in Braddock's sad business
two years ago.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, indeed!''  (<font color='red'><b>a nobleman</b></font>)</div>says the poker of a nobleman. <div class="bookquote">``I have the honour of
speaking to Mr.--?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To Major-General Lambert, at your lordship's service, and who was in
his (<font color='blue'><b>lordship</b></font>) Majesty's some time before you entered it. That, Mr. Warrington, is
the first commoner in England, Mr. Speaker Onslow. Where is your uncle?
I shall have to present you myself to his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) Majesty if Sir Miles delays
much longer.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>As he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) spoke, the worthy General addressed himself entirely
to his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) young friend, making no sort of account of his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) colleague, who
stalked away with a scared look as if amazed at the other's audacity. A
hundred years ago, a nobleman was a nobleman, and expected to be admired
as such.

<p/>Sir Miles's red waistcoat appeared in sight presently, and many cordial
greetings passed between him (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>), his (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) nephew, and General Lambert: for we
have described how Sir Miles was the most affectionate of men. So
the General had quitted my Lord Wrotham's house? It was time, as his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>)
lordship himself wished to occupy it? Very good; but consider what a
loss for the neighbours!

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We miss you, we positively miss you, my dear General,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sir Miles</b></font>)</div>cries Sir Miles.
<div class="bookquote">``My daughters were in love with those lovely young ladies--upon my word,
they were; and my Lady Warrington and my girls were debating over
and over again how they should find an opportunity of making the
acquaintance of your charming family. We feel as if we were old friends
already; indeed we do, General, if you will permit me the liberty of
saying so; and we love you, if I may be allowed to speak frankly, on
account of your friendship and kindness to our dear nephews: though we
were a little jealous, I own a little jealous of them, because they went
so often to see you. Often and often have I said to my Lady Warrington,
`My dear, why don't we make acquaintance with the General? Why don't we
ask him (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) ladies to come over in a family way and dine with some
other plain country gentlefolks?' Carry my most sincere respects to
Mrs. Lambert, I pray, sir; and thank her (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) for her (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) goodness to these young
gentlemen. My own flesh and blood, sir; my dear, dear brother's boys!''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) passed his (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) hand across his (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) manly eyes: he (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) was choking almost with
generous and affectionate emotion.

<p/>Whilst they were discoursing--George Warrington the while restraining
his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) laughter with admirable gravity--the door of the King's apartments
opened, and the pages entered, preceding his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) Majesty. He (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) was followed
by his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) burly son, his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) Royal Highness the Duke, a very corpulent Prince,
with a coat and face of blazing scarlet: behind them came various
gentlemen and officers of state; among whom George at once recognised
the famous Mr. Secretary Pitt, by his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) tall stature, his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) eagle eye and
beak, his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) grave and majestic presence. As I see that solemn figure
passing, even a hundred years off, I protest I feel a present awe, and a
desire to take my hat off. I am not frightened at George the Second; nor
are my eyes dazzled by the portentous appearance of his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) Royal Highness
the Duke of Culloden and Fontenoy; but the Great Commoner, the terrible
Cornet of Horse! His (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) figure bestrides our narrow isle of a century
back like a Colossus; and I hush as he (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) passes in his (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) gouty shoes, his (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>)
thunderbolt hand wrapped in flannel. Perhaps as we see him (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) now, issuing
with dark looks from the royal closet, angry scenes have been passing
between him (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) august master. He (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) has been boring that old monarch
for hours with prodigious long speeches, full of eloquence, voluble
with the noblest phrases upon the commonest topics; but, it must be
confessed, utterly repulsive to the little shrewd old gentleman, <div class="bookquote">``at
whose feet he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) lays himself,''  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>as the phrase is, and who has the most
thorough dislike for fine boedry and for fine brose too! The sublime
Minister passes solemnly through the crowd; the company ranges itself
respectfully round the wall; and his (<font color='blue'><b>Minister</b></font>) Majesty walks round the circle, his (<font color='blue'><b>Majesty</b></font>)
royal son lagging a little behind, and engaging select individuals in
conversation for his (<font color='blue'><b>Majesty</b></font>) own part.

<p/>The monarch is a little, keen, fresh-coloured old man, with very
protruding eyes, attired in plain, old-fashioned, snuff-coloured clothes
and brown stockings, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) only ornament the blue ribbon of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) Order of
the Garter. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) speaks in a German accent, but with ease, shrewdness, and
simplicity, addressing those individuals whom he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has a mind to notice,
or passing on with a bow. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knew Mr. Lambert well, who had served under
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) Majesty at Dettingen, and with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) royal son in Scotland, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
congratulated him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) good-humouredly on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) promotion.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is not always,''  (<font color='red'><b>Majesty</b></font>)</div>his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) Majesty was pleased to say, <div class="bookquote">``that we can do
as we like; but I was glad when, for once, I could give myself that
pleasure in your case, General; for my army contains no better officer
as you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Majesty</b></font>)</div><p/>The veteran blushed and bowed, deeply gratified at this speech.
Meanwhile, the Best of Monarchs was looking at Sir Miles Warrington
-LRB-whom his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) Majesty knew perfectly, as the eager recipient of all favours
from all Ministers-RRB-, and at the young gentleman by his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) side.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who is this?''  (<font color='red'><b>the Defender</b></font>)</div>the Defender of the Faith condescended to ask, pointing
towards George Warrington, who stood before his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) sovereign in a
respectful attitude, clad in poor Harry's best embroidered suit.

<p/>With the deepest reverence Sir Miles informed his (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) King, that the young
gentleman was his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) nephew, Mr. George Warrington, of Virginia, who asked
leave to pay his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) humble duty.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This, then, is the other brother?''  (<font color='red'><b>the Venerated Prince</b></font>)</div>the Venerated Prince deigned to
observe. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) came in time, else the other brother would have spent all
the money. My Lord Bishop of Salisbury, why do you come out in this
bitter weather? You had much better stay at home!''  (<font color='red'><b>the wielder</b></font>)</div>and with this, the
revered wielder of Britannia's sceptre passed on to other lords and
gentlemen of his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) court. Sir Miles Warrington was deeply affected at the
royal condescension. He (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) clapped his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) nephew's hands. <div class="bookquote">``God bless you, my
boy,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) cried; <div class="bookquote">``I told you that you would see the greatest monarch and
the finest gentleman in the world. Is he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) not so, my Lord Bishop?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bishop</b></font>) is!''  (<font color='red'><b>lordship</b></font>)</div>cried his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) lordship, clasping his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) ruffled hands, and
turning his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) fine eyes up to the sky, <div class="bookquote">``the best of princes and of men.''

 (<font color='red'><b>lordship</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is Master Louis, my Lady Yarmouth's favourite nephew,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Lambert/Lambert</b></font>)</div>says
Lambert, pointing to a young gentleman who stood with a crowd round him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>);
and presently the stout Duke of Cumberland came up to our little group.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) Royal Highness held out his (<font color='blue'><b>Highness</b></font>) hand to his (<font color='blue'><b>Highness</b></font>) old companion-in-arms.
<div class="bookquote">``Congratulate you on your promotion, Lambert,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Highness</b></font>) said good-naturedly.
Sir Miles Warrington's eyes were ready to burst out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) head with
rapture.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I owe it, sir, to your Royal Highness's good offices,''  (<font color='red'><b>the General</b></font>)</div>said the
grateful General.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not at all; not at all: ought to have had it a long time before. Always
been a good officer; perhaps there'll be some employment for you soon.
This is the gentleman whom James Wolfe introduced to me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``His (<font color='blue'><b>Wolfe</b></font>) brother, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, the real Fortunate Youth! You were with poor Ned Braddock in
America--a prisoner, and lucky enough to escape. Come and see me, sir,
in Pall Mall. Bring him (<font color='blue'><b>Braddock</b></font>) to my levee, Lambert.''  (<font color='red'><b>the Royal Prince</b></font>)</div>And the broad back of the
Royal Prince was turned to our friends.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is raining! You came on foot, General Lambert? You and George must
come home in my coach. You must and shall come home with me, I say. By
George, you must! I'll have no denial,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Baronet</b></font>)</div>cried the enthusiastic Baronet;
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) drove George and the General back to Hill Street, and presented
the latter to my Lady Warrington and his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) darlings, Flora and Dora, and
insisted upon their partaking of a collation, as they must be hungry
after their ride. <div class="bookquote">``What, there is only cold mutton? Well, an old soldier
can eat cold mutton. And a good glass of my Lady Warrington's own
cordial, prepared with her (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) own hands, will keep the cold wind out.
Delicious cordial! Capital mutton! Our own, my dear General,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Baronet</b></font>)</div>says the
hospitable Baronet, <div class="bookquote">``our own from the country, six years old if a day.
We keep a plain table; but all the Warringtons since the Conqueror have
been remarkable for their love of mutton; and our meal may look a little
scanty, and is, for we are plain people, and I am obliged to keep my
rascals of servants on board-wages. Can't give them seven-year-old
mutton, you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Baronet</b></font>)</div><p/>Sir Miles, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) nephew's presence and hearing, described to his (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) wife
and daughters George's reception at court in such flattering terms that
George hardly knew himself, or the scene at which he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) had been present,
or how to look his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) uncle in the face, or how to contradict him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) before
his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) family in the midst of the astonishing narrative he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) was relating.
Lambert sat by for a while with open eyes. He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>), too, had been at
Kensington. He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) had seen none of the wonders which Sir Miles described.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We are proud of you, dear George. We love you, my dear nephew--we all
love you, we are all proud of you--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; but I like Harry best,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>says a little voice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``--not because you are wealthy! Screwby, take Master Miles to his (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>)
governor. Go, dear child. Not because you are blest with great estates
and an ancient name; but because, George, you have put to good use the
talents with which Heaven has adorned you; because you have fought and
bled in your country's cause, in your monarch's cause, and as such are
indeed worthy of the favour of the best of sovereigns. General Lambert,
you have kindly condescended to look in on a country family, and partake
of our unpretending meal. I hope we may see you some day when our
hospitality is a little less homely. Yes, by George, General, you must
and shall name a day when you and Mrs. Lambert, and your dear girls,
will dine with us. I'll take no refusal now, by George I won't,''  (<font color='red'><b>the knight</b></font>)</div>bawls
the knight.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You will accompany us, I trust, to my drawing-room?''  (<font color='red'><b>lady</b></font>)</div>says my lady,
rising.

<p/>Mr. Lambert pleaded to be excused; but the ladies on no account would
let dear George go away. No, positively, he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) should not go. They wanted
to make acquaintance with their cousin. They must hear about that
dreadful battle and escape from the Indians. Tom Claypool came in and
heard some of the story. Flora was listening to it with her (<font color='blue'><b>Flora</b></font>) handkerchief
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Flora</b></font>) eyes, and little Miles had just said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why do you take your handkerchief, Flora? You're not crying a bit.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miles</b></font>)</div><p/>Being a man of great humour, Martin Lambert, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) went home, could
not help entertaining his (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) wife with an account of the new family with
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) had made acquaintance. A certain cant word called humbug had
lately come into vogue. Will it be believed that the General used it to
designate the family of this virtuous country gentleman? He (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) described
the eager hospitalities of the father, the pompous flatteries of the
mother, and the daughters' looks of admiration; the toughness and
security of the mutton, and the abominable taste and odour of the
cordial; and we may be sure Mrs. Lambert contrasted Lady Warrington's
recent behaviour to poor Harry with her (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) present conduct to George.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is this Miss Warrington really handsome?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs</b></font>)</div>asks Mrs Lambent.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; she (<font color='blue'><b>Flora</b></font>) is very handsome indeed, and the most astounding flirt I have
ever set eyes on,''  (<font color='red'><b>the General</b></font>)</div>replies the General.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The hypocrite! I have no patience with such people!''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>cries the lady.

<p/>To which the General, strange to say, only replied by the monosyllable
<div class="bookquote">``Bo!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the General</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why do you say `Bo!' Martin?''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>asks the lady.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I say `Bo!' to a goose, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>the General</b></font>)</div>answers the General.

<p/>And his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) wife vows she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) does not know what he (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) means, or of what he (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) is
thinking, and the General says--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course not.''




 (<font color='red'><b>the General</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER LIX. In which we are treated to a Play


<p/>The real business of life, I fancy, can form but little portion of the
novelist's budget. When he (<font color='blue'><b>novelist</b></font>) is speaking of the profession of arms, in
which men can show courage or the reverse, and in treating of which the
writer naturally has to deal with interesting circumstances, actions,
and characters, introducing recitals of danger, devotedness, heroic
deaths, and the like, the novelist may perhaps venture to deal with
actual affairs of life: but otherwise, they scarcely can enter into our
stories. The main part of Ficulnus's life, for instance, is spent in
selling sugar, spices and cheese; of Causidicus's in poring over musty
volumes of black-letter law; of Sartorius's in sitting, cross-legged,
on a board after measuring gentlemen for coats and breeches. What can a
story-teller say about the professional existence of these men? Would a
real rustical history of hobnails and eighteenpence a day be endurable?
In the days whereof we are writing, the poets of the time chose to
represent a shepherd in pink breeches and a chintz waistcoat, dancing
before his (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) flocks, and playing a flageolet tied up with a blue satin
ribbon. I say, in reply to some objections which have been urged by
potent and friendly critics, that of the actual affairs of life the
novelist cannot be expected to treat--with the almost single exception
of war before named. But law, stockbroking, polemical theology,
linen-drapery, apothecary-business, and the like, how can writers manage
fully to develop these in their stories? All authors can do, is to
depict men out of their business--in their passions, loves, laughters,
amusements, hatreds, and what not--and describe these as well as they
can, taking the business part for granted, and leaving it as it were for
subaudition.

<p/>Thus, in talking of the present or the past world, I know I am
only dangling about the theatre-lobbies, coffee-houses, ridottos,
pleasure-haunts, fair-booths, and feasting- and fiddling-rooms of life;
that, meanwhile, the great serious past or present world is plodding in
its chambers, toiling at its humdrum looms, or jogging on its accustomed
labours, and we are only seeing our characters away from their work.
Corydon has to cart the litter and thresh the barley, as well as to make
love to Phillis; Ancillula has to dress and wash the nursery, to wait at
breakfast and on her (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) misses, to take the children out, etc., before
she (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) can have her (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) brief sweet interview through the area-railings with
Boopis, the policeman. All day long have his (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) heels to beat the stale
pavement before he (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) has the opportunity to snatch the hasty kiss or the
furtive cold pie. It is only at moments, and away from these labours,
that we can light upon one character or the other; and hence, though
most of the persons of whom we are writing have doubtless their grave
employments and avocations, it is only when they are disengaged and
away from their work, that we can bring them and the equally disengaged
reader together.

<p/>The macaronis and fine gentlemen at White's and Arthur's continued to
show poor Harry Warrington such a very cold shoulder, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) sought
their society less and less, and the Ring and the Mall and the
gaming-table knew him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) no more. Madame de Bernstein was for her (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) nephew's
braving the indifference of the world, and vowed that it would be
conquered, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>) would but have courage to face it; but the young man
was too honest to wear a smiling face when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was discontented; to
disguise mortification or anger; to parry slights by adroit flatteries
or cunning impudence; as many gentlemen and gentlewomen must and do who
wish to succeed in society.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You pull a long face, Harry, and complain of the world's treatment of
you,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>the old lady said. <div class="bookquote">``Fiddlededee, sir! Everybody has to put up with
impertinences: and if you get a box on the ear now you are poor and cast
down, you must say nothing about it, bear it with a smile, and if
you can, revenge it ten years after. Moi qui vous parle, sir!--do you
suppose I have had no humble-pie to eat? All of us in our turn are
called upon to swallow it: and, now you are no longer the Fortunate
Youth, be the Clever Youth, and win back the place you have lost by your
ill luck. Go about more than ever. Go to all the routs and parties to
which you are asked, and to more still. Be civil to everybody--to all
women especially. Only of course take care to show your spirit, of
which you have plenty. With economy, and by your brother's, I must say,
admirable generosity, you can still make a genteel figure. With your
handsome person, sir, you can't fail to get a rich heiress. Tenez! You
should go amongst the merchants in the City, and look out there. They
won't know that you are out of fashion at the Court end of the town.
With a little management, there is not the least reason, sir, why you
should not make a good position for yourself still. When did you go to
see my Lady Yarmouth, pray? Why did you not improve that connexion?
She (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) took a great fancy to you. I desire you will be constant at her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>)
ladyship's evenings, and lose no opportunity of paying court to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div><p/>Thus the old woman who had loved Harry so on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) first appearance in
England, who had been so eager for his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) company, and pleased with his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
artless conversation, was taking the side of the world, and turning
against him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). Instead of the smiles and kisses with which the fickle old
creature used once to greet him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) received him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) with coldness; she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
became peevish and patronising; she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) cast gibes and scorn at him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) before
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) guests, making his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) honest face flush with humiliation, and awaking
the keenest pangs of grief and amazement in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) gentle, manly heart.
Madame de Bernstein's servants, who used to treat him (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>) with such
eager respect, scarcely paid him (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>) now any attention. My lady was often
indisposed or engaged when he (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>) called on her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>); her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) people did not press
him (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>) to wait; did not volunteer to ask whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>) would stay and dine, as
they used in the days when he (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>) was the Fortunate Youth and companion
of the wealthy and great. Harry carried his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) woes to Mrs. Lambert. In a
passion of sorrow he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) told her (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) aunt's cruel behaviour to him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
was stricken down and dismayed by the fickleness and heartlessness of
the world in its treatment of him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). While the good lady and her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) daughters
would move to and fro, and busy themselves with the cares of the house,
our poor lad would sit glum in a window-seat, heart-sick and silent.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I know you are the best people alive,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) would say to the ladies, <div class="bookquote">``and
the kindest, and that I must be the dullest company in the world--yes,
that I am.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the ladies</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, you are not very lively, Harry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hetty/Miss Hetty/Lambert</b></font>)</div>says Miss Hetty, who began to
command him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>), and perhaps to ask herself, <div class="bookquote">``What? Is this the gentleman
whom I took to be such a hero?''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If he (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) is unhappy, why should he (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) be lively?''  (<font color='red'><b>Theo</b></font>)</div>asks Theo, gently. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) has
a good heart, and is pained at his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) friends' desertion of him (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>). Sure there
is no harm in that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I would have too much spirit to show I was hurt, though,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hetty/Miss Hetty/Lambert</b></font>)</div>cries Hetty,
clenching her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) little fists. <div class="bookquote">``And I would smile, though that horrible
old painted woman boxed my ears. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is horrible, mamma. You think so
yourself, Theo! Own, now, you think so yourself! You said so last
night, and acted her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) coming in on her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) crutch, and grinning round to the
company.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I mayn't like her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Theo/Lady Theo</b></font>)</div>said Theo, turning very red. <div class="bookquote">``But there is no
reason why I should call Harry's aunt names before Harry's face.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You provoking thing; you are always right!''  (<font color='red'><b>Hetty/Miss Hetty/Lambert</b></font>)</div>cries Hetty, <div class="bookquote">``and that's
what makes me so angry. Indeed, Harry, it was very wrong of me to make
rude remarks about any of your relations.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hetty/Miss Hetty/Lambert</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't care about the others, Hetty; but it seems hard that this one
should turn upon me. I had got to be very fond of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>); and you see, it
makes me mad, somehow, when people I'm very fond of turn away from me,
or act unkind to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Suppose George were to do so?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hetty/Miss Hetty/Lambert</b></font>)</div>asks Hetty. You see, it was George and
Hetty, and Theo and Harry, amongst them now.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are very clever and very lively, and you may suppose a number of
things; but not that, Hetty, if you please,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>cried Harry, standing up
and looking very resolute and angry. <div class="bookquote">``You don't know my brother as
I know him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)--or you wouldn't take--such a--liberty as to suppose--my
brother George could do anything unkind or unworthy!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Harry/Mr. Harry Warrington</b></font>)</div>Mr. Harry was
quite in a flush as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) spoke.

<p/>Hetty turned very white. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) looked up at Harry, and then she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) did
not say a single word.

<p/>Then Harry said, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) simple way, before taking leave, <div class="bookquote">``I'm very
sorry, and I beg your pardon, Hetty, if I said anything rough, or that
seemed unkind; but I always fight up if anybody says anything against
George.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div><p/>Hetty did not answer a word out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) pale lips, but gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) hand,
and dropped a prim little curtsey.

<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) and Theo were together at night, making curl-paper confidences,
<div class="bookquote">``Oh!''  (<font color='red'><b>Theo/Lady Theo</b></font>)</div>said Hetty, <div class="bookquote">``I thought it would be so happy to see him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) every day,
and was so glad when papa said we were to stay in London! And now I do
see him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>), you see, I go on offending him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>). I can't help offending him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>);
and I know he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) is not clever, Theo. But oh! isn't he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) good, and kind, and
brave? Didn't he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) look handsome when he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) was angry?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hetty/Miss Hetty/Lambert</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You silly little thing, you are always trying to make him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) look
handsome,''  (<font color='red'><b>Theo/Lady Theo</b></font>)</div>Theo replied.

<p/>It was Theo and Hetty, and Harry and George, among these young people,
then; and I dare say the reason why General Lambert chose to apply the
monosyllable <div class="bookquote">``Bo''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Lambert/Lambert</b></font>)</div>to the mother of his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) daughters, was as a rebuke to
that good woman for the inveterate love of sentiment and propensity to
match-making which belonged to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) -LRB-and every other woman in the world
whose heart is worth a fig-RRB-; and as a hint that Madam Lambert was a
goose if she (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) fancied the two Virginian lads were going to fall in love
with the young women of the Lambert house. Little Het might have her (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>)
fancy; little girls will; but they get it over: <div class="bookquote">``and you know, Molly''
 (<font color='red'><b>girls</b></font>)</div>-LRB-which dear, soft-hearted Mrs. Lambert could not deny-RRB-, <div class="bookquote">``you fancied
somebody else before you fancied me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Lambert/Lambert</b></font>)</div>says the General; but Harry had
evidently not been smitten by Hetty; and now he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was superseded, as it
were, by having an elder brother over him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), and could not even call the
coat upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) back his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) own, Master Harry was no great catch.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh yes: now he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) is poor we will show him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) the door, as all the rest of
the world does, I suppose,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Lambert/Lambert</b></font>)</div>says Mrs. Lambert.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That is what I always do, isn't it, Molly? turn my back on my friends
in distress?''  (<font color='red'><b>the General</b></font>)</div>asks the General.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, my dear! I am a goose, now, and that I own, Martin!''  (<font color='red'><b>the wife</b></font>)</div>says the wife,
having recourse to the usual pocket-handkerchief.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let the poor boy come to us and welcome: ours is almost the only house
in this selfish place where so much can be said for him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) is unhappy,
and to be with us puts him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) at ease; in God's name let him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) be with us!''
 (<font color='red'><b>the officer</b></font>)</div>says the kind-hearted officer. Accordingly, whenever poor crestfallen
Hal wanted a dinner, or an evening's entertainment, Mr. Lambert's table
had a corner for him (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>). So was George welcome, too. He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) went among the
Lamberts, not at first with the cordiality which Harry felt for these
people, and inspired among them: for George was colder in his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) manner,
and more mistrustful of himself and others than his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) twin-brother: but
there was a goodness and friendliness about the family which touched
almost all people who came into frequent contact with them; and George
soon learned to love them for their own sake, as well as for their
constant regard and kindness to his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) brother. He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) could not but see
and own how sad Harry was, and pity his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) brother's depression. In his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
sarcastic way, George would often take himself to task before his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
brother for coming to life again, and say, <div class="bookquote">``Dear Harry, I am George the
Unlucky, though you have ceased to be Harry the Fortunate. Florac would
have done much better not to pass his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) sword through that Indian's body,
and to have left my scalp as an ornament for the fellow's belt. I say he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)
would, sir! At White's the people would have respected you. Our mother
would have wept over me, as a defunct angel, instead of being angry
with me for again supplanting her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) favourite--you are her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) favourite, you
deserve to be her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) favourite: everybody's favourite: only, if I had not
come back, your favourite, Maria, would have insisted on marrying you;
and that is how the gods would have revenged themselves upon you for
your prosperity.''

 (<font color='red'><b>brother</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I never know whether you are laughing at me or yourself, George''  (<font color='red'><b>the brother</b></font>)</div>says
the brother. I never know whether you are serious or jesting.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Precisely my own case, Harry, my dear!''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>says George.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But this I know, that there never was a better brother in the world;
and never better people than the Lamberts.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never was truer word said!''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>cries George, taking his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) brother's hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And if I'm unhappy, `tis not your fault--nor their fault--nor perhaps
mine, George,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>continues the younger. `Tis fate, you see, `tis the
having nothing to do. I must work; and how, George? that is the
question.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We will see what our mother says. We must wait till we hear from her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>),''
 (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>says George.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I say, George! Do you know, I don't think I should much like going back
to Virginia?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>says Harry, in a low, alarmed voice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What! in love with one of the lasses here?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Love `em like sisters--with all my heart, of course, dearest, best
girls! but, having come out of that business, thanks to you, I don't
want to go back, you know. No! no! It is not for that I fancy staying
in Europe better than going home. But, you see, I don't fancy hunting,
duck-shooting, tobacco-planting, whist-playing, and going to sermon,
over and over and over again, for all my life, George. And what else is
there to do at home? What on earth is there for me to do at all, I say?
That's what makes me miserable. It would not matter for you to be a
younger son you are so clever you would make your way anywhere; but,
for a poor fellow like me, what chance is there? Until I do something,
George, I shall be miserable, that's what I shall!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Have I not always said so? Art thou not coming round to my opinion?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What opinion, George? You know pretty much whatever you think, I think,
George!''  (<font color='red'><b>the junior</b></font>)</div>says the dutiful junior.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That Florac had best have left the Indian to take my scalp, my dear!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div><p/>At which Harry bursts away with an angry exclamation; and they continue
to puff their pipes in friendly union.

<p/>They lived together, each going his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) own gait; and not much intercourse,
save that of affection, was carried on between them. Harry never would
venture to meddle with George's books, and would sit as dumb as a mouse
at the lodgings whilst his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) brother was studying. They removed presently
from the Court end of the town, Madame de Bernstein pishing and
pshaing at their change of residence. But George took a great fancy to
frequenting Sir Hans Sloane's new reading-room and museum, just set
up in Montagu House, and he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) took cheerful lodgings in Southampton Row,
Bloomsbury, looking over the delightful fields towards Hampstead, at the
back of the Duke of Bedford's gardens. And Lord Wrotham's family coming
to Mayfair, and Mr. Lambert having business which detained him (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) in
London, had to change his (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) house, too, and engaged furnished apartments
in Soho, not very far off from the dwelling of our young men; and it
was, as we have said, with the Lamberts that Harry, night after night,
took refuge.

<p/>George was with them often, too; and, as the acquaintance ripened, he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
frequented their house with increasing assiduity, finding their company
more to his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) taste than that of Aunt Bernstein's polite circle of
gamblers, than Sir Miles Warrington's port and mutton, or the daily
noise and clatter of the coffee-houses. And as he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) and the Lambert ladies
were alike strangers in London, they partook of its pleasures together,
and, no doubt, went to Vauxhall and Ranelagh, to Marybone Gardens, and
the play, and the Tower, and wherever else there was honest amusement to
be had in those days. Martin Lambert loved that his (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) children should
have all the innocent pleasure which he (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) could procure for them, and Mr.
George, who was of a most generous, open-handed disposition, liked to
treat his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) friends likewise, especially those who had been so admirably
kind to his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) brother.

<p/>With all the passion of his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) heart Mr. Warrington loved a play. He (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) had
never enjoyed this amusement in Virginia, and only once or twice at
Quebec, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) visited Canada; and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) came to London, where the
two houses were in their full glory, I believe he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) never could
have enough of the delightful entertainment. Anything he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) liked himself,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) naturally wished to share amongst his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) companions. No wonder that he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>)
was eager to take his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) friends to the theatre, and we may be sure our
young countryfolks were not unwilling. Shall it be Drury Lane or Covent
Garden, ladies? There was Garrick and Shakspeare at Drury Lane. Well,
will it be believed, the ladies wanted to hear the famous new author
whose piece was being played at Covent Garden?

<p/>At this time a star of genius had arisen, and was blazing with quite a
dazzling brilliancy. The great Mr. John Home, of Scotland, had produced
a tragedy, than which, since the days of the ancients, there had been
nothing more classic and elegant. What had Mr. Garrick meant by refusing
such a masterpiece for his (<font color='blue'><b>Garrick</b></font>) theatre? Say what you will about Shakspeare;
in the works of that undoubted great poet -LRB-who had begun to grow vastly
more popular in England since Monsieur Voltaire attacked him (<font color='blue'><b>poet</b></font>)-RRB- there were
many barbarisms that could not but shock a polite auditory; whereas,
Mr. Home, the modern author, knew how to be refined in the very midst of
grief and passion; to represent death, not merely as awful, but graceful
and pathetic; and never condescended to degrade the majesty of the
Tragic Muse by the ludicrous apposition of buffoonery and familiar
punning, such as the elder playwright certainly had resort to. Besides,
Mr. Home's performance had been admired in quarters so high, and by
personages whose taste was known to be as elevated as their rank, that
all Britons could not but join in the plaudits for which august hands
had given the signal. Such, it was said, was the opinion of the very
best company, in the coffee-houses, and amongst the wits about town.
Why, the famous Mr. Gray, of Cambridge, said there had not been for a
hundred years any dramatic dialogue of such a true style; and as for the
poet's native capital of Edinburgh, where the piece was first brought
out, it was even said that the triumphant Scots called out from the pit
-LRB-in their dialect-RRB-, <div class="bookquote">``Where's Wully Shakspeare noo?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Scots</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should like to see the man who could beat Willy Shakspeare?''  (<font color='red'><b>the General</b></font>)</div>says the
General, laughing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mere national prejudice,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Warrington.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Beat Shakspeare, indeed!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Lambert/Lambert</b></font>)</div>cries Mrs. Lambert.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Pooh, pooh! you have cried more over Mr. Sam Richardson than ever you
did over Mr. Shakspeare, Molly!''  (<font color='red'><b>the General</b></font>)</div>remarks the General. <div class="bookquote">``I think few women
love to read Shakspeare: they say they love it, but they don't.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, papa!''  (<font color='red'><b>cry ladies</b></font>)</div>cry three ladies, throwing up three pair of hands.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, then, why do you all three prefer Douglas? And you, boys, who are
such Tories, will you go see a play which is wrote by a Whig Scotchman,
who was actually made prisoner at Falkirk?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Relicta non bene parmula,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Morris/Mr. Morris</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Jack the scholar.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay; it was relicta bene parmula,''  (<font color='red'><b>the General</b></font>)</div>cried the General. <div class="bookquote">``It was the
Highlanders who flung their targes down, and made fierce work among us
redcoats. If they had fought all their fields as well as that, and young
Perkin had not turned back from Derby--''

 (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know which side would be rebels, and who would be called the Young
Pretender,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>interposed George.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hush! you must please to remember my cloth, Mr. Warrington,''  (<font color='red'><b>the General</b></font>)</div>said the
General, with some gravity; <div class="bookquote">``and that the cockade I wear is a black, not
a white one! Well, if you will not love Mr. Home for his (<font color='blue'><b>Home</b></font>) politics, there
is, I think, another reason, George, why you should like him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>the General</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I may have Tory fancies, Mr. Lambert, but I think I know how to love
and honour a good Whig,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>said George, with a bow to the General: <div class="bookquote">``but
why should I like this Mr. Home, sir?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the General</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because, being a Presbyterian clergyman, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) has committed the heinous
crime of writing a play, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) brother-parsons have barked out an
excommunication at him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>). They took the poor fellow's means of livelihood
away from him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) for his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) performance; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) would have starved, but that
the young Pretender on our side of the water has given him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) a pension.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) has been persecuted by the parsons, there is hope for him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>said
George, smiling. <div class="bookquote">``And henceforth I declare myself ready to hear his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>)
sermons.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Woffington is divine in it, though not generally famous in
tragedy. Barry is drawing tears from all eyes; and Garrick is wild
at having refused the piece. Girls, you must bring each half a dozen
handkerchiefs! As for mamma, I cannot trust her (<font color='blue'><b>Woffington</b></font>); and she (<font color='blue'><b>Woffington</b></font>) positively must
be left at home.''

 (<font color='red'><b>mamma</b></font>)</div><p/>But mamma persisted she (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) would go; and, if need were to weep, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) would
sit and cry her (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) eyes out in a corner. They all went to Covent Garden,
then; the most of the party duly prepared to see one of the masterpieces
of the age and drama. Could they not all speak long pages of Congreve;
had they not wept and kindled over Otway and Rowe? O ye past literary
glories, that were to be eternal, how long have you been dead? Who knows
much more now than where your graves are? Poor, neglected Muse of the
bygone theatre! She (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) pipes for us, and we will not dance; she (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) tears her (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>)
hair, and we will not weep. And the Immortals of our time, how soon
shall they be dead and buried, think you? How many will survive? How
long shall it be ere Nox et Domus Plutonia shall overtake them?

<p/>So away went the pleased party to Covent Garden to see the tragedy of
the immortal John Home. The ladies and the General were conveyed in a
glass coach, and found the young men in waiting to receive them at
the theatre door. Hence they elbowed their way through a crowd of
torch-boys, and a whole regiment of footmen. Little Hetty fell to
Harry's arm in this expedition, and the blushing Miss Theo was handed
to the box by Mr. George. Gumbo had kept the places until his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) masters
arrived, when he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) retired, with many bows, to take his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) own seat in the
footman's gallery. They had good places in a front box, and there was
luckily a pillar behind which mamma could weep in comfort. And opposite
them they had the honour to see the august hope of the empire, his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) Royal
Highness George Prince of Wales, with the Princess Dowager his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) mother,
whom the people greeted with loyal, but not very enthusiastic, plaudits.
That handsome man standing behind his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) Royal Highness was my Lord
Bute, the Prince's Groom of the Stole, the patron of the poet whose
performance they had come to see, and over whose work the Royal party
had already wept more than once.

<p/>How can we help it, if during the course of the performance, Mr. Lambert
would make his (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) jokes and mar the solemnity of the scene? At first, as
the reader of the tragedy well knows, the characters are occupied in
making a number of explanations. Lady Randolph explains how it is that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Randolph</b></font>) is so melancholy. Married to Lord Randolph somewhat late in life,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Randolph</b></font>) owns, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Randolph</b></font>) lordship perceives, that a dead lover yet occupies
all her (<font color='blue'><b>Randolph</b></font>) heart; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Randolph</b></font>) husband is fain to put up with this dismal,
second-hand regard, which is all that my lady can bestow. Hence, an
invasion of Scotland by the Danes is rather a cause of excitement
than disgust to my lord, who rushes to meet the foe, and forgets the
dreariness of his (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) domestic circumstances. Welcome, Vikings and Norsemen!
Blow, northern blasts, the invaders' keels to Scotland's shore! Randolph
and other heroes will be on the beach to give the foemen a welcome! His (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>)
lordship has no sooner disappeared behind the trees of the forest, but
Lady Randolph begins to explain to her (<font color='blue'><b>Randolph</b></font>) confidante the circumstances of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Randolph</b></font>) early life. The fact was, she (<font color='blue'><b>Randolph</b></font>) had made a private marriage, and what
would the confidante say, if, in early youth, she (<font color='blue'><b>Randolph</b></font>), Lady Randolph, had
lost a husband? In the cold bosom of the earth was lodged the husband of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Randolph</b></font>) youth, and in some cavern of the ocean lies her (<font color='blue'><b>Randolph</b></font>) child and his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)!

<p/>Up to this the General behaved with as great gravity as any of his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) young
companions to the play; but when Lady Randolph proceeded to say, <div class="bookquote">``Alas!
Hereditary evil was the cause of my misfortunes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Randolph/Randolph</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) nudged George
Warrington, and looked so droll, that the young man burst out laughing.

<p/>The magic of the scene was destroyed after that. These two gentlemen
went on cracking jokes during the whole of the subsequent performance,
to their own amusement, but the indignation of their company, and
perhaps of the people in the adjacent boxes. Young Douglas, in those
days, used to wear a white satin <div class="bookquote">``shape''  (<font color='red'><b>Douglas</b></font>)</div>slashed at the legs and body,
and when Mr. Barry appeared in this droll costume, the General vowed it
was the exact dress of the Highlanders in the late war. The Chevalier's
Guard, he (<font color='blue'><b>Chevalier</b></font>) declared, had all white satin slashed breeches, and red
boots--<div class="bookquote">``only they left them at home, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>adds this wag. Not one
pennyworth of sublimity would he (<font color='blue'><b>Chevalier</b></font>) or George allow henceforth to Mr.
Home's performance. As for Harry, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) sate in very deep meditation over
the scene; and when Mrs. Lambert offered him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) a penny for his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) thoughts,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``That he (<font color='blue'><b>Garrick</b></font>) thought, Young Norval, Douglas, What-d’ye-call-’em,
the fellow in white satin--who looked as old as his (<font color='blue'><b>Douglas</b></font>) mother--was very
lucky to be able to distinguish himself so soon. I wish I could get
a chance, Aunt Lambert,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>says he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), drumming on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hat; on which mamma
sighed, and Theo, smiling, said, <div class="bookquote">``We must wait, and perhaps the Danes
will land.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Theo</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How do you mean?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>asks simple Harry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, the Danes always land, pour qui scait attendre!''  (<font color='red'><b>kind Theo</b></font>)</div>says kind Theo,
who had hold of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) sister's little hand, and, I dare say, felt its
pressure.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) did not behave unkindly--that was not in Miss Theo's nature--but
somewhat coldly to Mr. George, on whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) back, addressing
remarks, from time to time, to Harry. In spite of the gentlemen's scorn,
the women chose to be affected. A mother and son, meeting in love and
parting in tears, will always awaken emotion in female hearts.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Look, papa! there is an answer to all your jokes!''  (<font color='red'><b>Theo/Lady Theo</b></font>)</div>says Theo, pointing
towards the stage.

<p/>At a part of the dialogue between Lady Randolph and her (<font color='blue'><b>Randolph</b></font>) son, one of the
grenadiers on guard on each side of the stage, as the custom of those
days was, could not restrain his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) tears, and was visibly weeping before
the side-box.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are right, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>papa</b></font>)</div>says papa.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Didn't I tell you she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) always is?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hetty/Miss Hetty/Lambert</b></font>)</div>interposes Hetty.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yonder sentry is a better critic than we are, and a touch of nature
masters us all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Tamen usque recurrit!''  (<font color='red'><b>the student</b></font>)</div>cries the young student from college.

<p/>George felt abashed somehow, and interested too. He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) had been sneering,
and Theo sympathising. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) kindness was better--nay, wiser--than his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
scepticism, perhaps. Nevertheless, when, at the beginning of the fifth
act of the play, young Douglas, drawing his (<font color='blue'><b>Douglas</b></font>) sword and looking up at the
gallery, bawled out--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ye glorious stars! high heaven's resplendent host!
To whom I oft have of my lot complained,
Hear and record my soul's unaltered wish
Living or dead, let me but be renowned!
May Heaven inspire some fierce gigantic Dane
To give a bold defiance to our host!
Before he (<font color='blue'><b>Dane</b></font>) speaks it out, I will accept,
Like Douglas conquer, or like Douglas die!'' (<font color='red'><b>Douglas</b></font>)</div>--

<p/>The gods, to whom Mr. Barry appealed, saluted this heroic wish with
immense applause, and the General clapped his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) hands prodigiously. His (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>)
daughter was rather disconcerted.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This Douglas is not only brave, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Douglas</b></font>) is modest!''  (<font color='red'><b>papa</b></font>)</div>says papa.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I own I think he (<font color='blue'><b>Douglas</b></font>) need not have asked for a gigantic Dane,''  (<font color='red'><b>Theo/Lady Theo</b></font>)</div>says Theo,
smiling, as Lady Randolph entered in the midst of the gallery thunder.

<p/>When the applause had subsided, Lady Randolph is made to say--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My son, I heard a voice!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Randolph/Randolph</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) did hear a voice!''  (<font color='red'><b>papa</b></font>)</div>cries papa. <div class="bookquote">``Why, the fellow was
bellowing like a bull of Bashan.''  (<font color='red'><b>the General</b></font>)</div>And the General would scarcely behave
himself from thenceforth to the end of the performance. He (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>)
was heartily glad that the young gentleman was put to death behind
the scenes. When Lady Randolph's friend described how her (<font color='blue'><b>Randolph</b></font>) mistress had
<div class="bookquote">``flown like lightning up the hill, and plunged herself into the empty
air,''  (<font color='red'><b>mistress</b></font>)</div>Mr. Lambert said he (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) was delighted to be rid of her (<font color='blue'><b>Randolph</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``And as for
that story of her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) early marriage,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>says he (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``I have my very strongest
doubts about it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nonsense, Martin! Look, children! their Royal Highnesses are moving.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Princess</b></font>)</div><p/>The tragedy over, the Princess Dowager and the Prince were, in fact,
retiring; though, I dare say, the latter, who was always fond of a
farce, would have been far better pleased with that which followed than
he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) had been with Mr. Home's dreary tragic masterpiece.




<p/>CHAPTER LX. Which treats of Macbeth, a Supper, and a Pretty Kettle of
Fish


<p/>When the performances were concluded, our friends took coach for Mr.
Warrington's lodging, where the Virginians had provided an elegant
supper. Mr. Warrington was eager to treat them in the handsomest
manner, and the General and his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) wife accepted the invitation of the two
bachelors, pleased to think that they could give their young friends
pleasure. General and Mrs. Lambert, their son from college, their two
blooming daughters, and Mr. Spencer of the Temple, a new friend whom
George had met at the coffee-house, formed the party, and partook with
cheerfulness of the landlady's fare. The order of their sitting I have
not been able exactly to ascertain; but, somehow, Miss Theo had a place
next to the chickens and Mr. George Warrington, whilst Miss Hetty and a
ham divided the attentions of Mr. Harry. Mrs. Lambert must have been on
George's right hand, so that we have but to settle the three places of
the General, his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) son, and the Templar.

<p/>Mr. Spencer had been at the other theatre, where, on a former day, he (<font color='blue'><b>Spencer</b></font>)
had actually introduced George to the greenroom. The conversation about
the play was resumed, and some of the party persisted in being delighted
with it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``As for what our gentlemen say, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Lambert/Lambert</b></font>)</div>cries Mrs. Lambert to Mr. Spencer,
<div class="bookquote">``you must not believe a word of it. `Tis a delightful piece, and my
husband and Mr. George behaved as ill as possible.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Spencer/Spencer</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We laughed in the wrong place, and when we ought to have cried,''  (<font color='red'><b>the General</b></font>)</div>the
General owned, <div class="bookquote">``that's the truth.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the General</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You caused all the people in the boxes about us to look round and cry
`Hush!' You made the pit folks say, `Silence in the boxes, yonder!' Such
behaviour I never knew, and quite blushed for you, Mr. Lambert!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mamma thought it was a tragedy, and we thought it was a piece of fun,''
 (<font color='red'><b>the General</b></font>)</div>says the General. <div class="bookquote">``George and I behaved perfectly well, didn't we,
Theo?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not when I was looking your way, papa!''  (<font color='red'><b>Theo/Lady Theo</b></font>)</div>Theo replies. At which the
General asks, <div class="bookquote">``Was there ever such a saucy baggage seen?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the General</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You know, sir, I didn't speak till I was bid,''  (<font color='red'><b>Theo/Lady Theo</b></font>)</div>Theo continues,
modestly. <div class="bookquote">``I own I was very much moved by the play, and the beauty and
acting of Mrs. Woffington. I was sorry that the poor mother should find
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) child, and lose him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>). I am sorry, too, papa, if I oughtn't to have
been sorry!''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>adds the young lady, with a smile.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Women are not so clever as men, you know, Theo,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hetty/Miss Hetty/Lambert</b></font>)</div>cries Hetty from her (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>)
end of the table, with a sly look at Harry. <div class="bookquote">``The next time we go to the
play, please, brother Jack, pinch us when we ought to cry, or give us a
nudge when it is right to laugh.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish we could have had the fight,''  (<font color='red'><b>General</b></font>)</div>said General Lambert, <div class="bookquote">``the fight
between little Norval and the gigantic Norwegian--that would have been
rare sport: and you should write, Jack, and suggest it to Mr. Rich, the
manager.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Lambert/Lambert</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have not seen that: but I saw Slack and Broughton at Marybone
Gardens!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>says Harry, gravely; and wondered if he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had said something
witty, as all the company laughed so? <div class="bookquote">``It would require no giant,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)

How awful that dagger-scene was! You should have seen our host, ladies!
I presented Mr. Warrington, in the greenroom, to Mr. Garrick and Mrs.

his (<font color='blue'><b>Garrick</b></font>) box.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did the wife of the Thane of Cawdor sneeze?''  (<font color='red'><b>the General</b></font>)</div>asked the General, in an
awful voice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) thanked Mr. Warrington, in tones so hollow and tragic, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>)

sneezed thrice.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Macbeth, Macbeth, Macbeth!''  (<font color='red'><b>the General</b></font>)</div>cries the General.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And the great philosopher who was standing by Mr. Johnson, says, `You

was talking with the three witches as they sat against the wall.''

worlds to go behind the scenes!''  (<font color='red'><b>Theo</b></font>)</div>cries Theo.

pasteboard gold, and the tinsel jewels, and the painted old women, Theo?
No. Do not look too close,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>says the sceptical young host, demurely
drinking a glass of hock. <div class="bookquote">``You were angry with your papa and me.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay? I say, yes! You were angry with us because we laughed when you
were disposed to be crying. If I may speak for you, sir, as well as
myself,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>says George -LRB-with a bow to his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) guest, General Lambert-RRB-, <div class="bookquote">``I
think we were not inclined to weep, like the ladies, because we stood
behind the author's scenes of the play, as it were. Looking close up to
the young hero, we saw how much of him (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) was rant and tinsel; and as for
the pale, tragical mother, that her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) pallor was white chalk, and her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
grief her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) pocket-handkerchief. Own now, Theo, you thought me very
unfeeling?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Lambert/Lambert</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you find it out, sir, without my owning it,--what is the good of my
confessing?''  (<font color='red'><b>Theo/Lady Theo</b></font>)</div>says Theo.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Suppose I were to die?''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>goes on George, <div class="bookquote">``and you saw Harry in grief,
you would be seeing a genuine affliction, a real tragedy; you would
grieve too. But you wouldn't be affected if you saw the undertaker in
weepers and a black cloak!''

 (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed, but I should, sir!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Lambert/Lambert</b></font>)</div>says Mrs. Lambert; <div class="bookquote">``and so, I promise you,
would any daughter of mine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Lambert/Lambert</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps we might find weepers of our own, Mr. Warrington,''  (<font color='red'><b>Theo/Lady Theo</b></font>)</div>says Theo,
<div class="bookquote">``in such a case.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Theo/Lady Theo</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Would you?''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>cries George, and his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) cheeks and Theo's simultaneously
flushed up with red; I suppose because they both saw Hetty's bright
young eyes watching them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The elder writers understood but little of the pathetic,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Spencer/Spencer</b></font>)</div>remarked Mr.
Spencer, the Temple wit.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you think of Sophocles and Antigone?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>calls out Mr. John
Lambert.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Faith, our wits trouble themselves little about him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>), unless an Oxford
gentleman comes to remind us of him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)! I did not mean to go back farther
than Mr. Shakspeare, who, as you will all agree, does not understand
the elegant and pathetic as well as the moderns. Has he (<font color='blue'><b>Shakspeare</b></font>) ever approached
Belvidera, or Monimia, or Jane Shore; or can you find in his (<font color='blue'><b>Shakspeare</b></font>) comic
female characters the elegance of Congreve?''  (<font color='red'><b>the Templar</b></font>)</div>and the Templar offered
snuff to the right and left.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think Mr. Spencer himself must have tried his (<font color='blue'><b>Spencer</b></font>) hand?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>asks some one.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Many gentlemen of leisure have. Mr. Garrick, I own, has had a piece of
mine and returned it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And I confess that I have four acts of a play in one of my boxes,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>says
George.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll be bound to say it's as good as any of `em,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>whispers Harry to his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
neighbour.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it a tragedy or a comedy?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Lambert/Lambert</b></font>)</div>asks Mrs. Lambert.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, a tragedy, and two or three dreadful murders at least!''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>George
replies.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let us play it, and let the audience look to their eyes! Yet my chief
humour is for a tyrant,''  (<font color='red'><b>the General</b></font>)</div>says the General.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The tragedy, the tragedy! Go and fetch the tragedy this moment,
Gumbo!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Lambert/Lambert</b></font>)</div>calls Mrs. Lambert to the black. Gumbo makes a low bow and says,
<div class="bookquote">``Tragedy? yes, madam.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In the great cowskin trunk, Gumbo,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>George says, gravely.

<p/>Gumbo bows and says, <div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>with still superior gravity.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But my tragedy is at the bottom of I don't know how much linen,
packages, books, and boots, Hetty.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never mind, let us have it, and fling the linen out of window!''  (<font color='red'><b>Hetty/Miss Hetty/Lambert</b></font>)</div>cries
Miss Hetty.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And the great cowskin trunk is at our agent's at Bristol: so Gumbo must
get post-horses, and we can keep it up till he (<font color='blue'><b>agent</b></font>) returns the day after
to-morrow,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>says George.

<p/>The ladies groaned a comical <div class="bookquote">``Oh!''  (<font color='red'><b>The ladies</b></font>)</div>and papa, perhaps more seriously,
said, <div class="bookquote">``Let us be thankful for the escape. Let us be thinking of going
home too. Our young gentlemen have treated us nobly, and we will all
drink a parting bumper to Madam Esmond Warrington of Castlewood, in
Virginia. Suppose, boys, you were to find a tall, handsome stepfather
when you got home? Ladies as old as she (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) have been known to marry before
now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>papa</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To Madam Esmond Warrington, my old schoolfellow!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Lambert/Lambert</b></font>)</div>cries Mrs. Lambert.
<div class="bookquote">``I shall write and tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) what a pretty supper her (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) sons have given us:
and, Mr. George, I won't say how ill you behaved at the play!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>And,
with this last toast, the company took leave; the General's coach and
servant, with a flambeau, being in waiting to carry his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) family home.

<p/>After such an entertainment as that which Mr. Warrington had given, what
could be more natural or proper than a visit from him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) guests,
to inquire how they had reached home and rested? Why, their coach might
have taken the open country behind Montague House, in the direction
of Oxford Road, and been waylaid by footpads in the fields. The ladies
might have caught cold or slept ill after the excitement of the tragedy.
In a word, there was no reason why he (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) should make any excuse at all to
himself or them for visiting his (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) kind friends; and he (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) shut his (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) books
early at the Sloane Museum, and perhaps thought, as he (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) walked away
thence, that he (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) remembered very little about what he (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) had been reading.

<p/>Pray what is the meaning of this eagerness, this hesitation, this
pshaing and shilly-shallying, these doubts, this tremor as he (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) knocks
at the door of Mr. Lambert's lodgings in Dean Street, and survey the
footman who comes to his (<font color='blue'><b>Dean</b></font>) summons? Does any young man read? does any
old one remember? does any wearied, worn, disappointed pulseless heart
recall the time of its full beat and early throbbing? It is ever so many
hundred years since some of us were young; and we forget, but do not all
forget. No, madam, we remember with advantages, as Shakspeare's Harry
promised his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) soldiers they should do if they survived Agincourt and
that day of St. Crispin. Worn old chargers turned out to grass, if the
trumpet sounds over the hedge, may we not kick up our old heels, and
gallop a minute or so about the paddock, till we are brought up roaring?
I do not care for clown and pantaloon now, and think the fairy ugly, and
her (<font color='blue'><b>fairy</b></font>) verses insufferable: but I like to see children at a pantomime. I
do not dance, or eat supper any more; but I like to watch Eugenio and
Flirtilla twirling round in a pretty waltz, or Lucinda and Ardentio
pulling a cracker. Burn your little fingers, children! Blaze out little
kindly flames from each other's eyes! And then draw close together and
read the motto -LRB-that old namby-pamby motto, so stale and so new!-RRB---I
say, let her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucinda</b></font>) lips read it, and his (<font color='blue'><b>fairy</b></font>) construe it; and so divide the
sweetmeat, young people, and crunch it between you. I have no teeth.
Bitter almonds and sugar disagree with me, I tell you; but, for all
that, shall not bonbons melt in the mouth?

<p/>We follow John upstairs to the General's apartments, and enter with Mr.
George Esmond Warrington, who makes a prodigious fine bow. There is
only one lady in the room, seated near a window: there is not often much
sunshine in Dean Street: the young lady in the window is no especial
beauty: but it is spring-time, and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) is blooming vernally. A bunch
of fresh roses is flushing in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) honest cheek. I suppose her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) eyes are
violets. If we lived a hundred years ago, and wrote in the Gentleman's
or the London Magazine, we should tell Mr. Sylvanus Urban that her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) neck
was the lily, and her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) shape the nymph's: we should write an acrostic
about her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), and celebrate our Lambertella in an elegant poem, still to be
read between a neat new engraved plan of the city of Prague and the King
of Prussia's camp, and a map of Maryland and the Delaware counties.

<p/>Here is Miss Theo blushing like a rose. What could mamma have meant an
hour since by insisting that she (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) was very pale and tired, and had best
not come out to-day with the rest of the party? They were gone to pay
their compliments to my Lord Wrotham's ladies, and thank them for the
house in their absence; and papa was at the Horse Guards. He (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) is in great
spirits. I believe he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) expects some command, though mamma is in a sad
tremor lest he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) should again be ordered abroad.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your brother and mine are gone to see our little brother at his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) school
at the Chartreux. My brothers are both to be clergymen, I think,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Theo</b></font>)</div>Miss
Theo continues. She (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) is assiduously hemming at some article of boyish
wearing apparel as she (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) talks. A hundred years ago, young ladies were not
afraid either to make shirts, or to name them. Mind, I don't say they
were the worse or the better for that plain stitching or plain speaking:
and have not the least desire, my dear young lady, that you should make
puddings or I should black boots.

<p/>So Harry has been with them? <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) often comes, almost every day,''  (<font color='red'><b>Theo/Lady Theo</b></font>)</div>Theo
says, looking up in George's face. <div class="bookquote">``Poor fellow! He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) likes us better than
the fine folks, who don't care for him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) now--now he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) is no longer a fine
folk himself,''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>adds the girl, smiling. <div class="bookquote">``Why have you not set up for the
fashion, and frequented the chocolate-houses and the racecourses, Mr.
Warrington?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Has my brother got so much good out of his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) gay haunts or his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) grand
friends, that I should imitate him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You might at least go to Sir Miles Warrington; sure his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) arms are open
to receive you. Her (<font color='blue'><b>friends</b></font>) ladyship was here this morning in her (<font color='blue'><b>friends</b></font>) chair, and
to hear her (<font color='blue'><b>friends</b></font>) praises of you! She (<font color='blue'><b>friends</b></font>) declares you are in a certain way to
preferment. She (<font color='blue'><b>friends</b></font>) says his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) Royal Highness the Duke made much of you at
court. When you are a great man will you forget us, Mr. Warrington?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, when I am a great man I will, Miss Lambert.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well! Mr. George, then--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``--Mr. George!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``When papa and mamma are here, I suppose there need be no mistering,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Theo/Lady Theo</b></font>)</div>says Theo, looking out of the window, ever so little frightened. <div class="bookquote">``And
what have you been doing, sir? Reading books, or writing more of your
tragedy? Is it going to be a tragedy to make us cry, as we like them, or
only to frighten us, as you like them?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There is plenty of killing, but, I fear, not much crying. I have not
met many women. I have not been very intimate with those. I daresay what
I have written is only taken out of books or parodied from poems which
I have read and imitated like other young men. Women do not speak to me,
generally; I am said to have a sarcastic way which displeases them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps you never cared to please them?''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Theo</b></font>)</div>inquires Miss Theo, with a
blush.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I displeased you last night; you know I did?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; only it can't be called displeasure, and afterwards thought I was
wrong.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did you think about me at all when I was away, Theo?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, George--that is, Mr.--well, George! I thought you and papa were
right about the play; and, as you said, that it was no real sorrow, only
affectation, which was moving us. I wonder whether it is good or ill
fortune to see so clearly? Hetty and I agreed that we would be very
careful, for the future, how we allowed ourselves to enjoy a tragedy.
So, be careful when yours comes! What is the name of it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) is not christened. Will you be the godmother? The name of the chief
character is--''  (<font color='red'><b>this mamma</b></font>)</div>But at this very moment mamma and Miss Hetty arrived
from their walk; and mamma straightway began protesting that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) never
expected to see Mr. Warrington at all that day--that is, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>)
might come--that is, it was very good of him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) to come, and the play and
the supper of yesterday were all charming, except that Theo had a little
headache this morning.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I dare say it is better now, mamma,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hetty/Miss Hetty/Lambert</b></font>)</div>says Miss Hetty.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed, my dear, it never was of any consequence; and I told mamma so,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Theo</b></font>)</div>says Miss Theo, with a toss of her (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) head.

<p/>Then they fell to talking about Harry. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was very low. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) must have
something to do. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was always going to the Military Coffee-House, and
perpetually poring over the King of Prussia's campaigns. It was not fair
upon him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>), to bid him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) remain in London, after his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) deposition, as it were.
He (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) said nothing, but you could see how he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) regretted his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) previous useless
life, and felt his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) present dependence, by the manner in which he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) avoided
his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) former haunts and associates. Passing by the guard at St. James's,
with John Lambert, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) had said to brother Jack, <div class="bookquote">``Why mayn't I be
a soldier too? I am as tall as yonder fellow, and can kill with a
fowling-piece as well as any man I know. But I can't earn so much as
sixpence a day. I have squandered my own bread, and now I am eating half
my brother's. He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) is the best of brothers, but so much the more shame
that I should live upon him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>). Don't tell my brother, Jack Lambert.''  (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Morris/Mr. Morris</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``And
my boy promised he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) wouldn't tell,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Lambert/Lambert</b></font>)</div>says Mrs. Lambert. No doubt. The
girls were both out of the room when their mother made this speech to
George Warrington. He (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>), for his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) part, said he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) had written home to his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>)
mother--that half his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) little patrimony, the other half likewise, if
wanted, were at Harry's disposal, for purchasing a commission, or for
any other project which might bring him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) occupation or advancement.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) has got a good brother, that is sure. Let us hope for good times for
him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>sighs the lady.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The Danes always come pour qui scait attendre,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>George said, in a low
voice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What, you heard that? Ah, George! my Theo is an--Ah! never mind what
she (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>) is, George Warrington,''  (<font color='red'><b>the mother</b></font>)</div>cried the pleased mother, with brimful eyes.
<div class="bookquote">``Bah! I am going to make a gaby of myself, as I did at the tragedy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div><p/>Now Mr. George had been revolving a fine private scheme, which
he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) thought might turn to his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) brother's advantage. After George's
presentation to his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) Royal Highness at Kensington, more persons than
one, his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) friend General Lambert included, had told him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) that the Duke had
inquired regarding him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>), and had asked why the young man did not come to
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) levee. Importunity so august could not but be satisfied. A day was
appointed between Mr. Lambert and his (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) young friend, and they went to pay
their duty to his (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) Royal Highness at his (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) house in Pall Mall.

<p/>When it came to George's turn to make a bow, the Prince was especially
gracious; he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) spoke to Mr. Warrington at some length about Braddock and
the war, and was apparently pleased with the modesty and intelligence
of the young gentleman's answers. George ascribed the failure of the
expedition to the panic and surprise certainly, but more especially to
the delays occasioned by the rapacity, selfishness, and unfair dealing
of the people of the colonies towards the King's troops who were come
to defend them. <div class="bookquote">``Could we have moved, sir, a month sooner, the fort
was certainly ours, and the little army had never been defeated,''
 (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>Mr. Warrington said; in which observation his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) Royal Highness entirely
concurred.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am told you saved yourself, sir, mainly by your knowledge of the
French language,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Royal Duke</b></font>)</div>the Royal Duke then affably observed. Mr. Warrington
modestly mentioned how he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) had been in the French colonies in his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) youth,
and had opportunities of acquiring that tongue.

<p/>The Prince -LRB-who had a great urbanity when well pleased, and the finest
sense of humour-RRB- condescended to ask who had taught Mr. Warrington the
language; and to express his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) opinion, that, for the pronunciation, the
French ladies were by far the best teachers.

<p/>The young Virginian gentleman made a low bow, and said it was not for
him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) to gainsay his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) Royal Highness; upon which the Duke was good enough
to say -LRB-in a jocose manner-RRB- that Mr. Warrington was a sly dog.

<p/>Mr. W. remaining respectfully silent, the Prince continued, most kindly:
<div class="bookquote">``I take the field immediately against the French, who, as you know, are
threatening his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) Majesty's Electoral dominions, If you have a mind to
make the campaign with me, your skill in the language may be useful,
and I hope we shall be more fortunate than poor Braddock!''  (<font color='red'><b>the Prince</b></font>)</div>Every eye
was fixed on a young man to whom so great a Prince offered so signal a
favour.

<p/>And now it was that Mr. George thought he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) would make his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) very cleverest
speech. <div class="bookquote">``Sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``your Royal Highness's most kind proposal does
me infinite honour, but--''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But what, sir?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>says the Prince, staring at him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But I have entered myself of the Temple, to study our laws, and to fit
myself for my duties at home. If my having been wounded in the service
of my country be any claim on your kindness, I would humbly ask that my
brother, who knows the French language as well as myself, and has far
more strength, courage, and military genius, might be allowed to serve
your Royal Highness; in the place of--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Enough, enough, sir!''  (<font color='red'><b>the son</b></font>)</div>cried out the justly irritated son of the
monarch. <div class="bookquote">``What? I offer you a favour, and you hand it over to your
brother? Wait, sir, till I offer you another!''  (<font color='red'><b>the Prince</b></font>)</div>And with this the Prince
turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) back upon Mr. Warrington, just as abruptly as he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) turned it on
the French a few months afterwards.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, George! oh, George! Here's a pretty kettle of fish!''  (<font color='red'><b>General</b></font>)</div>groaned
General Lambert, as he (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) young friend walked home together.




<p/>CHAPTER LXI. In which the Prince marches up the Hill and down again


<p/>We understand the respectful indignation of all loyal Britons when they
come to read of Mr. George Warrington's conduct towards a gallant
and gracious Prince, the beloved son of the best of monarchs, and the
Captain-General of the British army. What an inestimable favour has not
the young man slighted! What a chance of promotion had he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) not thrown
away! Will Esmond, whose language was always rich in blasphemies,
employed his (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) very strongest curses in speaking of his (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) cousin's
behaviour, and expressed his (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) delight that the confounded young Mohock
was cutting his (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) own throat. Cousin Castlewood said that a savage
gentleman had a right to scalp himself if he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) liked; or perhaps, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) added
charitably, our cousin Mr. Warrington heard enough of the war-whoop
in Braddock's affair, and has no more stomach for fighting. Mr. Will
rejoiced that the younger brother had gone to the deuce, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) rejoiced
to think that the elder was following him (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>). The first time he (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) met the
fellow, Will said, he (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) should take care to let Mr. George know what he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
thought of him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you intend to insult George, at least you had best take care that
his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) brother Harry is out of hearing!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady</b></font>)</div>cried Lady Maria--on which we may
fancy more curses uttered by Mr. Will, with regard to his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) twin kinsfolk.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ta, ta, ta!''  (<font color='red'><b>lord</b></font>)</div>says my lord. <div class="bookquote">``No more of this squabbling! We can't be all
warriors in the family!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I never heard your lordship laid claim to be one!''  (<font color='red'><b>Maria/Lady Maria/Lady Maria Esmond</b></font>)</div>says Maria.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Never, my dear; quite the contrary! Will is our champion, and one is
quite enough in the house. So I dare say with the two Mohocks;--George
is the student, and Harry is the fighting man. When you intended
to quarrel, Will, what a pity it was you had not George, instead of
t'other, to your hand!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Your lordship's hand is famous--at piquet,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Will/Will/Will Esmond</b></font>)</div>says Will's mother.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is a pretty one,''  (<font color='red'><b>lord</b></font>)</div>says my lord, surveying his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) fingers, with a
simper. <div class="bookquote">``My Lord Hervey's glove and mine were of a size. Yes, my hand,
as you say, is more fitted for cards than for war. Yours, my Lady
Castlewood, is pretty dexterous, too. How I bless the day when you
bestowed it on my lamented father!''  (<font color='red'><b>lordship</b></font>)</div>In this play of sarcasm, as in some
other games of skill, his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) lordship was not sorry to engage, having a
cool head, and being able to beat his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) family all round.

<p/>Madame de Bernstein, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) heard of Mr. Warrington's bevue, was
exceedingly angry, stormed, and scolded her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) immediate household; and
would have scolded George but she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) was growing old, and had not the
courage of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) early days. Moreover, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) was a little afraid of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>)
nephew, and respectful in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) behaviour to him (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``You will never make
your fortune at court, nephew!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) groaned, when, soon after his (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>)
discomfiture, the young gentleman went to wait upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It was never my wish, madam,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>said Mr. George, in a very stately
manner.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your wish was to help Harry? You might hereafter have been of service
to your brother, had you accepted the Duke's offer. Princes do not
love to have their favours refused, and I don't wonder that his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) Royal
Highness was offended.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``General Lambert said the same thing,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>George confessed, turning rather
red; <div class="bookquote">``and I see now that I was wrong. But you must please remember that
I had never seen a court before, and I suppose I am scarce likely to
shine in one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think possibly not, my good nephew,''  (<font color='red'><b>the aunt</b></font>)</div>says the aunt, taking snuff.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And what then?''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>asked George. <div class="bookquote">``I never had ambition for that kind
of glory, and can make myself quite easy without it. When his (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) Royal
Highness spoke to me--most kindly, as I own--my thought was, I shall
make a very bad soldier, and my brother would be a very good one. He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) has
a hundred good qualities for the profession, in which I am deficient;
and would have served a Commanding Officer far better than I ever could.
Say the Duke is in battle, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Officer</b></font>) horse is shot, as my poor chief's
was at home, would he (<font color='blue'><b>Officer</b></font>) not be better for a beast that had courage and
strength to bear him (<font color='blue'><b>Officer</b></font>) anywhere, than with one that could not carry his (<font color='blue'><b>Officer</b></font>)
weight?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Au fait. His (<font color='blue'><b>Officer</b></font>) Royal Highness's charger must be a strong one, my dear!''
 (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>says the old lady.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Expende Hannibalem,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>mutters George, with a shrug. <div class="bookquote">``Our Hannibal weighs
no trifle.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't quite follow you, sir, and your Hannibal,''  (<font color='red'><b>Baroness</b></font>)</div>the Baroness
remarks.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``When Mr. Wolfe and Mr. Lambert remonstrated with me as you have done,
madam,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>George rejoins, with a laugh, <div class="bookquote">``I made this same defence which I
am making to you. I said I offered to the Prince the best soldier in the
family, and the two gentlemen allowed that my blunder at least had
some excuse. Who knows but that they may set me right with his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) Royal
Highness? The taste I have had of battles has shown me how little my
genius inclines that way. We saw the Scotch play which everybody is
talking about t'other night. And when the hero, young Norval, said how
he (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) longed to follow to the field some warlike lord, I thought to myself,
`how like my Harry is to him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), except that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) doth not brag.' Harry is
pining now for a red coat, and if we don't mind, will take the shilling.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) has the map of Germany for ever under his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) eyes, and follows the King
of Prussia everywhere. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) is not afraid of men or gods. As for me, I
love my books and quiet best, and to read about battles in Homer or
Lucan.''

 (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then what made a soldier of you at all, my dear? And why did you not
send Harry with Mr. Braddock, instead of going yourself?''  (<font color='red'><b>Bernstein/Madame de Bernstein/Madame Bernstein</b></font>)</div>asked Madame
de Bernstein.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My mother loved her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) younger son the best,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>said George, darkly.
<div class="bookquote">``Besides, with the enemy invading our country, it was my duty, as the
head of our family, to go on the campaign. Had I been a Scotchman twelve
years ago, I should have been a--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hush, sir! or I shall be more angry than ever!''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>said the old lady, with
a perfectly pleased face.

<p/>George's explanation might thus appease Madame de Bernstein, an old
woman whose principles we fear were but loose: but to the loyal heart of
Sir Miles Warrington and his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) lady, the young man's conduct gave a severe
blow indeed! <div class="bookquote">``I should have thought,''  (<font color='red'><b>ladyship</b></font>)</div>her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) ladyship said, <div class="bookquote">``from my sister
Esmond Warrington's letter, that my brother's widow was a woman of good
sense and judgment, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) had educated her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) sons in a becoming
manner. But what, Sir Miles, what, my dear Thomas Claypool, can we think
of an education which has resulted so lamentably for both these young
men?''

 (<font color='red'><b>ladyship</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The elder seems to know a power of Latin, though, and speaks the
French and the German too. I heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Claypool</b></font>) with the Hanover Envoy, at the
Baroness's rout,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Claypool</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Claypool. <div class="bookquote">``The French he (<font color='blue'><b>Claypool</b></font>) jabbered quite easy:
and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Claypool</b></font>) was at a loss for the High Dutch, he (<font color='blue'><b>Claypool</b></font>) and the Envoy began in
Latin, and talked away till all the room stared.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is not language, but principles, Thomas Claypool!''  (<font color='red'><b>the matron</b></font>)</div>exclaims the
virtuous matron. <div class="bookquote">``What must Mr. Warrington's principles be, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>)
could reject an offer made him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) by his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) Prince? Can he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) speak the High
Dutch? So much the more ought he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) to have accepted his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) Royal Highness's
condescension, and made himself useful in the campaign! Look at our son,
look at Miles!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hold up thy head, Miley, my boy!''  (<font color='red'><b>papa</b></font>)</div>says papa.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I trust, Sir Miles, that, as a member of the House of Commons, as an
English gentleman, you will attend his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) Royal Highness's levee to-morrow,
and say, if such an offer had been made to us for that child, we would
have taken it, though our boy is but ten years of age.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Faith, Miley, thou wouldst make a good little drummer or fifer!''  (<font color='red'><b>papa</b></font>)</div>says
papa. <div class="bookquote">``Shouldst like to be a little soldier, Miley?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Anything, sir, anything! a Warrington ought to be ready at any moment
to have himself cut in pieces for his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) sovereign!''  (<font color='red'><b>the matron</b></font>)</div>cries the matron,
pointing to the boy; who, as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) comprehended his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) mother's
proposal, protested against it by a loud roar, in the midst of which he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
was removed by Screwby. In obedience to the conjugal orders, Sir Miles
went to his (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) Royal Highness's levee the next day, and made a protest of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) love and duty, which the Prince deigned to accept, saying:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nobody ever supposed that Sir Miles Warrington would ever refuse any
place offered to him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Prince</b></font>)</div><p/>A compliment gracious indeed, and repeated everywhere by Lady
Warrington, as showing how implicitly the august family on the throne
could rely on the loyalty of the Warringtons.

<p/>Accordingly, when this worthy couple saw George, they received him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) with
a ghastly commiseration, such as our dear relatives or friends will
sometimes extend to us when we have done something fatal or clumsy in
life; when we have come badly out of our lawsuit; when we enter the room
just as the company has been abusing us; when our banker has broke; or
we for our sad part have had to figure in the commercial columns of the
London Gazette;--when, in a word, we are guilty of some notorious fault,
or blunder, or misfortune. Who does not know that face of pity? Whose
dear relations have not so deplored him (<font color='blue'><b>banker</b></font>), not dead, but living? Not
yours? Then, sir, if you have never been in scrapes; if you have never
sowed a handful of wild oats or two; if you have always been fortunate,
and good, and careful, and butter has never melted in your mouth, and
an imprudent word has never come out of it; if you have never sinned and
repented, and been a fool and been sorry--then, sir, you are a wiseacre
who won't waste your time over an idle novel, and it is not de te that
the fable is narrated at all.

<p/>Not that it was just on Sir Miles's part to turn upon George, and be
angry with his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) nephew for refusing the offer of promotion made by his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
Royal Highness, for Sir Miles himself had agreed in George's view of
pursuing quite other than a military career, and it was in respect to
this plan of her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) son's that Madam Esmond had written from Virginia
to Sir Miles Warrington. George had announced to her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) intention of
entering at the Temple, and qualifying himself for the magisterial
and civil duties which, in the course of nature, he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) would be called to
fulfil; nor could any one applaud his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) resolution more cordially than his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
uncle Sir Miles, who introduced George to a lawyer of reputation, under
whose guidance we may fancy the young gentleman reading leisurely.
Madam Esmond from home signified her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) approval of her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) son's course, fully
agreeing with Sir Miles -LRB-to whom and his (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) lady she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) begged to send her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
grateful remembrances-RRB- that the British Constitution was the envy of
the world, and the proper object of every English gentleman's admiring
study. The chief point to which George's mother objected was the notion
that Mr. Warrington should have to sit down in the Temple dinner-ball,
and cut at a shoulder of mutton, and drink small-beer out of tin
pannikins, by the side of rough students who wore gowns like the
parish-clerk. George's loyal younger brother shared too this repugnance.
Anything was good enough for him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>), Harry said; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was a younger son, and
prepared to rough it; but George, in a gown, and dining in a mess with
three nobody's sons off dirty pewter platters! Harry never could relish
this condescension on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) brother's part, or fancy George in his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) proper
place at any except the high table; and was sorry that a plan Madam
Esmond hinted at in her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) letters was not feasible--viz., that an
application should be made to the Master of the Temple, who should be
informed that Mr. George Warrington was a gentleman of most noble birth,
and of great property in America, and ought only to sit with the very
best company in the Hall. Rather to Harry's discomfiture, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
communicated his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) own and his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) mother's ideas to the gentlemen's new
coffee-house friend, Mr. Spencer, Mr. Spencer received the proposal with
roars of laughter; and I cannot learn, from the Warrington papers, that
any application was made to the Master of the Temple on this subject.
Besides his (<font color='blue'><b>Master</b></font>) literary and historical pursuits, which were those he (<font color='blue'><b>Master</b></font>)
most especially loved, Mr. Warrington studied the laws of his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) country,
attended the courts at Westminster, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) heard a Henley, a Pratt,
a Murray, and those other great famous schools of eloquence and
patriotism, the two houses of parliament.

<p/>Gradually Mr. Warrington made acquaintance with some of the members of
the House and the Bar; who, when they came to know him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>), spoke of him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>)
as a young gentleman of good parts and good breeding, and in terms so
generally complimentary, that his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) good uncle's heart relented towards
him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>), and Dora and Flora began once more to smile upon him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>). This
reconciliation dated from the time when his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) Royal Highness the Duke,
after having been defeated by the French, in the affair of Hastenbeck,
concluded the famous capitulation with the French, which his (<font color='blue'><b>Highness</b></font>) Majesty
George II. refused to ratify. His (<font color='blue'><b>Highness</b></font>) Royal Highness, as `tis well known,
flung up his (<font color='blue'><b>Highness</b></font>) commissions after this disgrace, laid down his (<font color='blue'><b>Highness</b></font>) commander's
baton--which, it must be confessed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Highness</b></font>) had not wielded with much luck or
dexterity--and never again appeared at the head of armies or in public
life. The stout warrior would not allow a word of complaint against his (<font color='blue'><b>warrior</b></font>)
father and sovereign to escape his (<font color='blue'><b>warrior</b></font>) lips; but, as he (<font color='blue'><b>warrior</b></font>) retired with his (<font color='blue'><b>warrior</b></font>)
wounded honour, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>warrior</b></font>) would have no interest or authority more, nor
any places to give, it may be supposed that Sir Miles Warrington's anger
against his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) nephew diminished as his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) respect for his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) Royal Highness
diminished.

<p/>As our two gentlemen were walking in St. James's Park, one day, with
their friend Mr. Lambert, they met his (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) Royal Highness in plain clothes
and without a star, and made profound bows to the Prince, who was
pleased to stop and speak to them.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) asked Mr. Lambert how he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) liked my Lord Ligonier, his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) new chief at
the Horse Guards, and the new duties there in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) was engaged? And,
recognising the young men, with that fidelity of memory for which his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>)
Royal race hath ever been remarkable, he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) said to Mr. Warrington:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You did well, sir, not to come with me when I asked you in the spring.''

 (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I was sorry, then, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>Mr. Warrington said, making a very low
reverence, <div class="bookquote">``but I am more sorry now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div><p/>On which the Prince said, <div class="bookquote">``Thank you, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Prince</b></font>)</div>and, touching his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) hat,
walked away. And the circumstances of this interview, and the discourse
which passed at it, being related to Mrs. Esmond Warrington in a letter
from her (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) younger son, created so deep an impression in that lady's mind,
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) narrated the anecdote many hundreds of times until all her (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>)
friends and acquaintances knew and, perhaps, were tired of it.

<p/>Our gentlemen went through the Park, and so towards the Strand, where
they had business. And Mr. Lambert, pointing to the lion on the top of
the Earl of Northumberland's house at Charing Cross, says:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Harry Warrington! your brother is like yonder lion.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charing Cross</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) is as brave as one,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>says Harry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Because I respect virgins!''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>says George, laughing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Because you are a stupid lion. Because you turn your back on the East,
and absolutely salute the setting sun. Why, child, what earthly good can
you get by being civil to a man in hopeless dudgeon and disgrace? Your
uncle will be more angry with you than ever--and so am I, sir.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lambert</b></font>)</div>But Mr.
Lambert was always laughing in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) waggish way, and, indeed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) did not
look the least angry.




<p/>CHAPTER LXII. Arma Virumque


<p/>Indeed, if Harry Warrington had a passion for military pursuits and
studies, there was enough of war stirring in Europe, and enough talk in
all societies which he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) frequented in London, to excite and inflame him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>).
Though our own gracious Prince of the house of Hanover had been beaten,
the Protestant Hero, the King of Prussia, was filling the world with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Hero</b></font>) glory, and winning those astonishing victories in which I deem it
fortunate on my own account that my poor Harry took no part; for
then his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) veracious biographer would have had to narrate battles the
description whereof has been undertaken by another pen. I am glad, I
say, that Harry Warrington was not at Rossbach on that famous Gunpowder
Fete-day, on the 5th of November, in the year 1757; nor at that
tremendous slaughtering-match of Leuthen, which the Prussian king played
a month afterwards; for these prodigious actions will presently be
narrated in other volumes, which I and all the world are eager to
behold. Would you have this history compete with yonder book? Could
my jaunty, yellow park-phaeton run counter to that grim chariot of
thundering war? Could my meek little jog-trot Pegasus meet the shock of
yon steed of foaming bit and flaming nostril? Dear, kind reader -LRB-with
whom I love to talk from time to time, stepping down from the stage
where our figures are performing, attired in the habits and using the
parlance of past ages-RRB-,--my kind, patient reader! it is a mercy for both
of us that Harry Warrington did not follow the King of the Borussians,
as he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) was minded to do, for then I should have had to describe battles
which Carlyle is going to paint; and I don't wish you should make odious
comparisons between me and that master.

<p/>Harry Warrington not only did not join the King of the Borussians, but
he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) pined and chafed at not going. He (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) led a sulky useless life, that is
the fact. He (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) dangled about the military coffee-houses. He (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) did not care
for reading anything save a newspaper. His (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) turn was not literary. He (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>)
even thought novels were stupid; and, as for the ladies crying their
eyes out over Mr. Richardson, he (<font color='blue'><b>Richardson</b></font>) could not imagine how they could be
moved by any such nonsense. He (<font color='blue'><b>Richardson</b></font>) used to laugh in a very hearty jolly
way, but a little late, and some time after the joke was over. Pray, why
should all gentlemen have a literary turn? And do we like some of our
friends the worse because they never turned a couplet in their lives?
Ruined, perforce idle, dependent on his (<font color='blue'><b>Richardson</b></font>) brother for supplies, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Richardson</b></font>) read
a book falling asleep over it, with no fitting work for his (<font color='blue'><b>Richardson</b></font>) great strong
hands to do--how lucky it is that he (<font color='blue'><b>Richardson</b></font>) did not get into more trouble! Why,
in the case of Achilles himself, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) was sent by his (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) mamma to the
court of King What-d’ye-call-’em in order to be put out of harm's reach,
what happened to him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) amongst a parcel of women with whom he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) was made to
idle his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) life away? And how did Pyrrhus come into the world? A powerful
mettlesome young Achilles ought not to be leading-stringed by women too
much; is out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) place dawdling by distaffs or handing coffee-cups;
and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) is not fighting, depend on it, is likely to fall into much
worse mischief.

<p/>Those soft-hearted women, the two elder ladies of the Lambert family,
with whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) mainly consorted, had an untiring pity and kindness for
Harry, such as women only--and only a few of those--can give. If a man
is in grief, who cheers him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>); in trouble, who consoles him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>); in wrath,
who soothes him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>); in joy, who makes him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) doubly happy; in prosperity, who
rejoices; in disgrace, who backs him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) against the world, and dresses
with gentle unguents and warm poultices the rankling wounds made by the
slings and arrows of outrageous Fortune? Who but woman, if you please?
You who are ill and sore from the buffets of Fate, have you one or two
of these sweet physicians? Return thanks to the gods that they have
left you so much of consolation. What gentleman is not more or less a
Prometheus? Who has not his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) rock -LRB-ai, ai-RRB-, his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) chain -LRB-ea, ea-RRB-, and his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
liver in a deuce of a condition? But the sea-nymphs come--the gentle,
the sympathising; they kiss our writhing feet; they moisten our parched
lips with their tears; they do their blessed best to console us Titans;
they don't turn their backs upon us after our overthrow.

<p/>Now Theo and her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) mother were full of pity for Harry; but Hetty's heart
was rather hard and seemingly savage towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) chafed that
his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) position was not more glorious; she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) was angry that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was still
dependent and idle. The whole world was in arms, and could he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) not carry
a musket? It was harvest-time, and hundreds of thousands of reapers were
out with their flashing sickles; could he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) not use his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), and cut down his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
sheaf or two of glory?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, how savage the little thing is with him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>papa</b></font>)</div>says papa, after a scene
in which, according to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) wont, Miss Hetty had been firing little
shots into that quivering target which came and set itself up in Mrs.
Lambert's drawing-room every day.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) conduct is perfectly abominable!''  (<font color='red'><b>mamma</b></font>)</div>cries mamma; <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) deserves to be
whipped, and sent to bed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>mamma</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps, mother, it is because she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) likes him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) better than any of us do,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Theo/Lady Theo</b></font>)</div>says Theo, <div class="bookquote">``and it is for his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) sake that Hetty is angry. If I were fond
of--of some one, I should like to be able to admire and respect him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>)
always--to think everything he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) did right--and my gentleman better than
all the gentlemen in the world.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Theo/Lady Theo</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The truth is, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Lambert/Lambert</b></font>)</div>answers Mrs. Lambert, <div class="bookquote">``that your father is so
much better than all the world, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) has spoiled us. Did you ever see any
one to compare with him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Lambert/Lambert</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very few, indeed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Theo</b></font>)</div>owns Theo, with a blush.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very few. Who is so good-tempered?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think nobody, mamma,''  (<font color='red'><b>Theo/Lady Theo</b></font>)</div>Theo acknowledges.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Or so brave?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, I dare say Mr. Wolfe, or Harry, or Mr. George, are very brave.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Or so learned and witty?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sure Mr. George seems very learned, and witty too, in his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) way,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Theo/Lady Theo</b></font>)</div>says Theo; <div class="bookquote">``and his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) manners are very fine--you own they are. Madame de
Bernstein says they are, and she (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) hath seen the world. Indeed, Mr. George
has a lofty way with him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>), which I don't see in other people; and, in
reading books, I find he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) chooses the fine noble things always, and loves
them in spite of all his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) satire. He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) certainly is of a satirical turn,
but then he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) is only bitter against mean things and people. No gentleman
hath a more tender heart I am sure; and but yesterday, after he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had been
talking so bitterly as you said, I happened to look out of window, and
saw him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) stop and treat a whole crowd of little children to apples at the
stall at the corner. And the day before yesterday, when he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was coming
and brought me the Moliere, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) stopped and gave money to a beggar, and
how charmingly, sure, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) reads the French! I agree with him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) though about
Tartuffe, though `tis so wonderfully clever and lively, that a mere
villain and hypocrite is a figure too mean to be made the chief of a
great piece. Iago, Mr. George said, is near as great a villain; but then
he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) is not the first character of the tragedy, which is Othello, with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Othello</b></font>) noble weakness. But what fine ladies and gentlemen Moliere
represents--so Mr. George thinks--and--but oh, I don't dare to repeat
the verses after him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Theo/Lady Theo</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you know them by heart, my dear?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Lambert/Lambert</b></font>)</div>asks Mrs. Lambert.

<p/>And Theo replies, <div class="bookquote">``Oh yes, mamma! I know them by... Nonsense!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Theo/Lady Theo</b></font>)</div><p/>I here fancy osculations, palpitations, and exit Miss Theo, blushing
like a rose. Why had she (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) stopped in her (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) sentence? Because mamma was
looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) so oddly. And why was mamma looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) so oddly? And
why had she (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) looked after Mr. George when he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) was going away, and looked
for him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) was coming? Ah, and why do cheeks blush, and why do
roses bloom? Old Time is still a-flying. Old spring and bud time; old
summer and bloom time; old autumn and seed time; old winter time, when
the cracking, shivering old tree-tops are bald or covered with snow.

<p/>A few minutes after George arrived, Theo would come downstairs with
a fluttering heart, may be, and a sweet nosegay in her (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) cheeks, just
culled, as it were, fresh in his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) honour; and I suppose she (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) must have
been constantly at that window which commanded the street, and whence
she (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) could espy his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) generosity to the sweep, or his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) purchases from the
apple-woman. But if it was Harry who knocked, she (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) remained in her (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) own
apartment with her (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) work or her (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) books, sending her (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) sister to receive
the young gentleman, or her (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) brothers when the elder was at home from
college, or Doctor Crusius from the Chartreux gave the younger leave
to go home. And what good eyes Theo must have had--and often in the
evening, too--to note the difference between Harry's yellow hair and
George's dark locks--and between their figures, though they were so like
that people continually were mistaking one for the other brother. Now it
is certain that Theo never mistook one or t'other; and that Hetty, for
her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) part, was not in the least excited, or rude, or pert, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) found
the black-haired gentleman in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) mother's drawing-room.

<p/>Our friends could come when they liked to Mr. Lambert's house, and stay
as long as they chose; and, one day, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) of the golden locks was sitting
on a couch there, in an attitude of more than ordinary idleness and
despondency, when who should come down to him (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) but Miss Hetty? I say it
was a most curious thing -LRB-though the girls would have gone to the rack
rather than own any collusion-RRB-, that when Harry called, Hetty appeared;
when George arrived, Theo somehow came; and so, according to the usual
dispensation, it was Miss Lambert, junior, who now arrived to entertain
the younger Virginian.

<p/>After usual ceremonies and compliments we may imagine that the lady says
to the gentleman:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And pray, sir, what makes your honour look so glum this morning?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, Hetty!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>says he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``I have nothing else to do but to look glum. I
remember when we were boys--and I a rare idle one, you may be sure--I
would always be asking my tutor for a holiday, which I would pass very
likely swinging on a gate, or making ducks and drakes over the pond, and
those do-nothing days were always the most melancholy. What have I got
to do now from morning till night?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Breakfast, walk--dinner, walk--tea, supper, I suppose; and a pipe of
your Virginia,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hetty/Miss Hetty/Lambert</b></font>)</div>says Miss Hetty, tossing her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) head.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I tell you what, when I went back with Charley to the Chartreux,
t'other night, I had a mind to say to the master, `Teach me, sir. Here's
a boy knows a deal more Latin and Greek, at thirteen, than I do, who
am ten years older. I have nothing to do from morning till night, and I
might as well go to my books again, and see if I can repair my idleness
as a boy.' Why do you laugh, Hetty?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I laugh to fancy you at the head of a class, and called up by the
master!''  (<font color='red'><b>Hetty/Miss Hetty/Lambert</b></font>)</div>cries Hetty.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shouldn't be at the head of the class,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>Harry says, humbly. <div class="bookquote">``George
might be at the head of any class, but I am not a bookman, you see; and
when I was young neglected myself, and was very idle. We would not let
our tutors cane us much at home, but, if we had, it might have done me
good.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hetty/Miss Hetty/Lambert</b></font>)</div><p/>Hetty drubbed with her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) little foot, and looked at the young man sitting
before her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)--strong, idle, melancholy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Upon my word, it might do you good now!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) was minded to say. <div class="bookquote">``What
does Tom say about the caning at school? Does his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) account of it set you
longing for it, pray?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``His (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) account of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) school,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>Harry answered simply, <div class="bookquote">``makes me see that I
have been idle when I ought to have worked, and that I have not a genius
for books, and for what am I good? Only to spend my patrimony when I
come abroad, or to lounge at coffee-houses or racecourses, or to gallop
behind dogs when I am at home. I am good for nothing, I am.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What, such a great, brave, strong fellow as you good for nothing?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>cries Het. <div class="bookquote">``I would not confess as much to any woman, if I were twice as
good for nothing!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What am I to do? I ask for leave to go into the army, and Madam Esmond
does not answer me. `Tis the only thing I am fit for. I have no money to
buy. Having spent all my own, and so much of my brother's, I cannot and
won't ask for more. If my mother would but send me to the army, you know
I would jump to go.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Eh! A gentleman of spirit does not want a woman to buckle his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) sword on
for him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) or to clean his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) firelock! What was that our papa told us of the
young gentleman at court yesterday?--Sir John Armytage--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sir John Armytage? I used to know him (<font color='blue'><b>Armytage</b></font>) when I frequented White's and
the club-houses--a fine, noble young gentleman, of a great estate in the
North.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And engaged to be married to a famous beauty, too--Miss Howe, my Lord
Howe's sister--but that, I suppose, is not an obstacle to gentlemen?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``An obstacle to what?''  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>asks the gentleman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``An obstacle to glory!''  (<font color='red'><b>Hetty/Miss Hetty/Lambert</b></font>)</div>says Miss Hetty. <div class="bookquote">``I think no woman of spirit
would say `Stay!' though she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) adored her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) lover ever so much, when his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>)
country said `Go!' Sir John had volunteered for the expedition which is
preparing, and being at court yesterday his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) Majesty asked him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)
would be ready to go? `Tomorrow, please your Majesty,' replies Sir John,
and the king said, that was a soldier's answer. My father himself is
longing to go, though he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) has mamma and all us brats at home. Oh dear,
oh dear! Why wasn't I a man myself? Both my brothers are for the Church;
but, as for me, I know I should have made a famous little soldier!''  (<font color='red'><b>this person</b></font>)</div>And,
so speaking, this young person strode about the room, wearing a most
courageous military aspect, and looking as bold as Joan of Arc.

<p/>Harry beheld her (<font color='blue'><b>Joan</b></font>) with a tender admiration. <div class="bookquote">``I think,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>says he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``I would
hardly like to see a musket on that little shoulder, nor a wound on that
pretty face, Hetty.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Wounds! who fears wounds?''  (<font color='red'><b>the maid</b></font>)</div>cries the little maid. <div class="bookquote">``Muskets? If I could
carry one, I would use it. You men fancy that we women are good for
nothing but to make puddings or stitch samplers. Why wasn't I a man, I
say? George was reading to us yesterday out of Tasso--look, here it is,
and I thought the verses applied to me. See! Here is the book, with the
mark in it where we left off.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``With the mark in it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>says Harry dutifully.

<p/>``Yes! it is about a woman who is disappointed because--because her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
brother does not go to war, and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) says of herself--

<p/>```Alas! why did not Heaven these members frail
With lively force and vigour strengthen, so
That I this silken gown...'''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Silken gown?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>says downright Harry, with a look of inquiry.

<p/>``Well, sir, I know `tis but Calimanco;--but so it is in the book--

<p/>```... this silken gown and slender veil
Might for a breastplate and a helm forgo;
Then should not heat, nor cold, nor rain, nor hail,
Nor storms that fall, nor blust'ring winds that blow,
Withhold me; but I would, both day and night,
In pitched field or private combat, fight--'

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Fight? Yes, that I would! Why are both my brothers to be parsons, I
say? One of my papa's children ought to be a soldier!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry laughed, a very gentle, kind laugh, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) felt
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) would not like much to hit such a tender little warrior as that.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>says he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), holding a finger out, <div class="bookquote">``I think here is a finger nigh as
big as your arm. How would you stand up before a great, strong man? I
should like to see a man try and injure you, though; I should just like
to see him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)! You little, delicate, tender creature! Do you suppose any
scoundrel would dare to do anything unkind to you?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And, excited by this
flight of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) imagination, Harry fell to walking up and down the room,
too, chafing at the idea of any rogue of a Frenchman daring to be rude
to Miss Hester Lambert.

<p/>It was a belief in this silent courage of his (<font color='blue'><b>Frenchman</b></font>) which subjugated Hetty,
and this quality which she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) supposed him (<font color='blue'><b>Frenchman</b></font>) to possess, which caused her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
specially to admire him (<font color='blue'><b>Frenchman</b></font>). Miss Hetty was no more bold, in reality, than
Madam Erminia, whose speech she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) had been reading out of the book, and
about whom Mr. Harry Warrington never heard one single word. He (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) may have
been in the room when brother George was reading his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) poetry out to the
ladies, but his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) thoughts were busy with his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) own affairs, and he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) was
entirely bewildered with your Clotildas and Erminias, and giants, and
enchanters, and nonsense. No, Miss Hetty, I say and believe, had nothing
of the virago in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) composition; else, no doubt, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) would have taken
a fancy to a soft young fellow with a literary turn, or a genius for
playing the flute, according to the laws of contrast and nature provided
in those cases; and who has not heard how great, strong men have an
affinity for frail, tender little women; how tender little women are
attracted by great, honest, strong men; and how your burly heroes and
champions of war are constantly henpecked? If Mr. Harry Warrington falls
in love with a woman who is like Miss Lambert in disposition, and if he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>)
marries her (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>)--without being conjurers, I think we may all see what the
end will be.

<p/>So, whilst Hetty was firing her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) little sarcasms into Harry, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) for a
while scarcely felt that they were stinging him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), and let her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) shoot on
without so much as taking the trouble to shake the little arrows out of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hide. Did she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) mean by her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) sneers and innuendoes to rouse him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) into
action? He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was too magnanimous to understand such small hints. Did she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
mean to shame him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) by saying that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>), a weak woman, would don the casque
and breastplate? The simple fellow either melted at the idea of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
being in danger, or at the notion of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) fighting fell a-laughing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Pray what is the use of having a strong hand if you only use it to hold
a skein of silk for my mother?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hester/Miss Hester/Miss Hester Lambert</b></font>)</div>cries Miss Hester; <div class="bookquote">``and what is the good
of being ever so strong in a drawing-room? Nobody wants you to throw
anybody out of window, Harry! A strong man, indeed! I suppose there's a
stronger at Bartholomew Fair. James Wolfe is not a strong man. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wolfe</b></font>) seems
quite weakly and ill. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Wolfe</b></font>) was here last he (<font color='blue'><b>Wolfe</b></font>) was coughing the whole
time, and as pale as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Wolfe</b></font>) had seen a ghost.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hester/Miss Hester/Miss Hester Lambert</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I never could understand why a man should be frightened at a ghost,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>says Harry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Pray, have you seen one, sir?''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>asks the pert young lady.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No. I thought I did once at home--when we were boys; but it was only
Nathan in his (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) night-shirt; but I wasn't frightened when I thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>)
was a ghost. I believe there's no such things. Our nurses tell a pack of
lies about `em,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>says Harry, gravely. <div class="bookquote">``George was a little frightened;
but then he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)'s--''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Here he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) paused.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then George is what?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hetty/Miss Hetty/Lambert</b></font>)</div>asked Hetty.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``George is different from me, that's all. Our mother's a bold woman as
ever you saw, but she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) screams at seeing a mouse--always does--can't help
it. It's her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) nature. So, you see, perhaps my brother can't bear ghosts.
I don't mind `em.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``George always says you would have made a better soldier than he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So I think I should, if I had been allowed to try. But he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) can do a
thousand things better than me, or anybody else in the world. Why didn't
he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) let me volunteer on Braddock's expedition? I might have got knocked
on the head, and then I should have been pretty much as useful as I
am now, and then I shouldn't have ruined myself, and brought people to
point at me and say that I had disgraced the name of Warrington. Why
mayn't I go on this expedition, and volunteer like Sir John Armytage?
Oh, Hetty! I'm a miserable fellow--that's what I am,''  (<font color='red'><b>the fellow</b></font>)</div>and the miserable
fellow paced the room at double quick time. <div class="bookquote">``I wish I had never come to
Europe,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) groaned out.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What a compliment to us! Thank you, Harry!''  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>But presently, on an
appealing look from the gentleman, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``Are you--are you thinking
of going home?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And have all Virginia jeering at me! There's not a gentleman there
that wouldn't, except one, and him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) my mother doesn't like. I should
be ashamed to go home now, I think. You don't know my mother, Hetty. I
ain't afraid of most things; but, somehow, I am of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>). What shall I say
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>), when she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) says, `Harry, where's your patrimony?' `Spent, mother,'
I shall have to say. `What have you done with it?' `Wasted it, mother,
and went to prison after.' `Who took you out of prison?' `Brother
George, ma’am, he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) took me out of prison; and now I'm come back,
having done no good for myself, with no profession, no prospects, no
nothing--only to look after negroes, and be scolded at home; or to go to
sleep at sermons; or to play at cards, and drink, and fight cocks at the
taverns about.' How can I look the gentlemen of the country in the face?
I'm ashamed to go home in this way, I say. I must and will do something!
What shall I do, Hetty? Ah! what shall I do?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do? What did Mr. Wolfe do at Louisbourg? Ill as he (<font color='blue'><b>Wolfe</b></font>) was, and in love as

to dawdle with his (<font color='blue'><b>Wolfe</b></font>) sweetheart. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wolfe</b></font>) went on the King's service, and hath
come back covered with honour. If there is to be another great campaign

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) would take me with him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>), and that a ball would knock me on the
head and finish me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>groaned Harry. <div class="bookquote">``You speak to me, Hetty, as though
it were my fault that I am not in the army, when you know I would
give--give, forsooth, what have I to give?--yes! my life to go on
service!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Life indeed!''  (<font color='red'><b>Hetty/Miss Hetty/Lambert</b></font>)</div>says Miss Hetty, with a shrug of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) shoulders.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't seem to think that of much value, Hetty,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>remarked Harry,
sadly. <div class="bookquote">``No more it is--to anybody. I'm a poor useless fellow. I'm not
even free to throw it away as I would like, being under orders here and
at home.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Orders indeed! Why under orders?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hetty/Miss Hetty/Lambert</b></font>)</div>cries Miss Hetty. <div class="bookquote">``Aren't you tall
enough, and old enough, to act for yourself, and must you have George
for a master here, and your mother for a schoolmistress at home? If
I were a man, I would do something famous before I was two-and-twenty
years old, that I would! I would have the world speak of me. I wouldn't
dawdle at apron-strings. I wouldn't curse my fortune--I'd make it. I vow
and declare I would!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div><p/>Now, for the first time, Harry began to wince at the words of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) young
lecturer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No negro on our estate is more a slave than I am, Hetty,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said,
turning very red as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) addressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``but then, Miss Lambert, we don't
reproach the poor fellow for not being free. That isn't generous. At
least, that isn't the way I understand honour. Perhaps with women it's
different, or I may be wrong, and have no right to be hurt at a young
girl telling me what my faults are. Perhaps my faults are not my
faults--only my cursed luck. You have been talking ever so long about
this gentleman volunteering, and that man winning glory, and cracking up
their courage as if I had none of my own. I suppose, for the matter of
that, I'm as well provided as other gentlemen. I don't brag but I'm not
afraid of Mr. Wolfe, nor of Sir John Armytage, nor of anybody else that
ever I saw. How can I buy a commission when I've spent my last shilling,
or ask my brother for more who has already halved with me? A gentleman
of my rank can't go a common soldier--else, by Jupiter, I would! And if
a ball finished me, I suppose Miss Hetty Lambert wouldn't be very sorry.
It isn't kind, Hetty--I didn't think it of you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What is it I have said?''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>asks the young lady. <div class="bookquote">``I have only said Sir
John Armytage has volunteered, and Mr. Wolfe has covered himself with
honour, and you begin to scold me! How can I help it if Mr. Wolfe is
brave and famous? Is that any reason you should be angry, pray?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I didn't say angry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>said Harry, gravely. <div class="bookquote">``I said I was hurt.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, indeed! I thought such a little creature as I am couldn't hurt
anybody! I'm sure `tis mighty complimentary to me to say that a young
lady whose arm is no bigger than your little finger can hurt such a
great strong man as you!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I scarce thought you would try, Hetty,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>the young man said. You see,
I'm not used to this kind of welcome in this house.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is it, my poor boy?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Lambert/Lambert</b></font>)</div>asks kind Mrs. Lambert, looking in at
the door at this juncture, and finding the youth with a very woeworn
countenance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, we have heard the story before, mamma!''  (<font color='red'><b>Hetty/Miss Hetty/Lambert</b></font>)</div>says Hetty, hurriedly.
<div class="bookquote">``Harry is making his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) old complaint of having nothing to do. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) is
quite unhappy; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) is telling us so over and over again, that's all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So are you hungry over and over again, my dear! Is that a reason why
your papa and I should leave off giving you dinner?''  (<font color='red'><b>mamma</b></font>)</div>cries mamma, with
some emotion. <div class="bookquote">``Will you stay and have ours, Harry? `Tis just three
o’clock!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>Harry agreed to stay, after a few faint negations. <div class="bookquote">``My husband
dines abroad. We are but three women, so you will have a dull dinner,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Lambert/Lambert</b></font>)</div>remarks Mrs. Lambert.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We shall have a gentleman to enliven us, mamma, I dare say!''  (<font color='red'><b>mamma</b></font>)</div>says Madam
Pert, and then looked in mamma's face with that admirable gaze of
blank innocence which Madam Pert knows how to assume when she (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) has been
specially and successfully wicked.

<p/>When the dinner appeared. Miss Hetty came downstairs, and was
exceedingly chatty, lively, and entertaining. Theo did not know that any
little difference had occurred -LRB-such, alas, my Christian friends,
will happen in the most charming families-RRB-, did not know, I say, that
anything had happened until Hetty's uncommon sprightliness and
gaiety roused her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) suspicions. Hetty would start a dozen subjects of
conversation--the King of Prussia, and the news from America; the last
masquerade, and the highwayman shot near Barnet; and when her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) sister,
admiring this volubility, inquired the reason of it, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) eyes,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, my dear, you need not nod and wink at me!''  (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div>cries Hetty. <div class="bookquote">``Mamma
asked Harry on purpose to enliven us, and I am talking until he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) begins,
just like the fiddles at the playhouse, you know, Theo! First the
fiddles. Then the play. Pray begin, Harry!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hester!''  (<font color='red'><b>mamma</b></font>)</div>cries mamma.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I merely asked Harry to entertain us. You said yourself, mother, that
we were only three women, and the dinner would be dull for a gentleman;
unless, indeed, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) chose to be very lively.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm not that on most days--and, Heaven knows, on this day less than
most,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>says poor Harry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why on this day less than another? Tuesday is as good a day to be
lively as Wednesday. The only day when we mustn't be lively is Sunday.
Well, you know it is, ma’am! We mustn't sing, nor dance, nor do anything
on Sunday.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div><p/>And in this naughty way the young woman went on for the rest of the
evening, and was complimented by her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) mother and sister when poor Harry
took his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) leave. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was not ready of wit, and could not fling back the
taunts which Hetty cast against him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). Nay, had he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) been able to retort, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
would have been silent. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was too generous to engage in that small war,
and chose to take all Hester's sarcasms without an attempt to parry
or evade them. Very likely the young lady watched and admired that
magnanimity, while she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) tried it so cruelly. And after one of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) fits of
ill-behaviour, her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) parents and friends had not the least need to scold
her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), as she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) candidly told them, because she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) suffered a great deal more
than they would ever have had her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), and her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) conscience punished her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) a
great deal more severely than her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) kind elders would have thought of
doing. I suppose she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) lies awake all that night, and tosses and tumbles
in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) bed. I suppose she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) wets her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) pillow with tears, and should not
mind about her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) sobbing: unless it kept her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) sister awake; unless she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was
unwell the next day, and the doctor had to be fetched; unless the whole
family is to be put to discomfort; mother to choke over her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) dinner in
flurry and indignation; father to eat his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) roast-beef in silence and with
bitter sauce; everybody to look at the door each time it opens, with a
vague hope that Harry is coming in. If Harry does not come, why at least
does not George come? thinks Miss Theo.

<p/>Some time in the course of the evening comes a billet from George
Warrington, with a large nosegay of lilacs, per Mr. Gumbo. ```I send my
best duty and regards to Mrs. Lambert and the ladies,''' George says,
```and humbly beg to present to Miss Theo this nosegay of lilacs, which
she (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) says she (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) loves in the early spring. You must not thank me for them,
please, but the gardener of Bedford House, with whom I have made great
friends by presenting him (<font color='blue'><b>House</b></font>) with some dried specimens of a Virginian plant
which some ladies don't think as fragrant as lilacs.

<p/>```I have been in the garden almost all the day. It is alive with
sunshine and spring; and I have been composing two scenes of you know
what, and polishing the verses which the Page sings in the fourth act,
under Sybilla's window, which she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) cannot hear, poor thing, because she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)
has just had her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) head off.'''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Provoking! I wish he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) would not always sneer and laugh! The verses are
beautiful,''  (<font color='red'><b>Theo/Lady Theo</b></font>)</div>says Theo.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You really think so, my dear? How very odd!''  (<font color='red'><b>remarks papa</b></font>)</div>remarks papa.

<p/>Little Het looks up from her (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) dismal corner with a faint smile of humour.
Theo's secret is a secret for nobody in the house, it seems. Can any
young people guess what it is? Our young lady continues to read:

<p/>```Spencer has asked the famous Mr. Johnson to breakfast to-morrow,
who condescends to hear the play, and who won't, I hope, be too angry
because my heroine undergoes the fate of his (<font color='blue'><b>Spencer</b></font>) in Irene. I have heard he (<font color='blue'><b>Spencer</b></font>)
came up to London himself as a young man with only his (<font color='blue'><b>Spencer</b></font>) tragedy in his (<font color='blue'><b>Spencer</b></font>)
wallet. Shall I ever be able to get mine played? Can you fancy the
catcall music beginning, and the pit hissing at that perilous part of
the fourth act, where my executioner comes out from the closet with his (<font color='blue'><b>executioner</b></font>)
great sword, at the awful moment when he (<font color='blue'><b>executioner</b></font>) is called upon to amputate?
They say Mr. Fielding, when the pit hissed at a part of one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Fielding</b></font>)
pieces, about which Mr. Garrick had warned him (<font color='blue'><b>Garrick</b></font>), said, `Hang them, they
have found it out, have they?' and finished his (<font color='blue'><b>Garrick</b></font>) punch in tranquillity.
I suppose his (<font color='blue'><b>Garrick</b></font>) wife was not in the boxes. There are some women to whom I
would be very unwilling to give pain, and there are some to whom I would
give the best I have.'''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Whom can he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) mean? The letter is to you, my dear. I protest he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) is making
love to your mother before my face!''  (<font color='red'><b>papa</b></font>)</div>cries papa to Hetty, who only gives
a little sigh, puts her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) hand in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) father's hand, and then withdraws
it.

<p/>```To whom I would give the best I have. To-day it is only a bunch of
lilacs. To-morrow it may be what?--a branch of rue--a sprig of bays,
perhaps--anything, so it be my best and my all.

<p/>```I have had a fine long day, and all to myself. What do you think of
Harry playing truant?''' -LRB-Here we may imagine, what they call in France,
or what they used to call, when men dared to speak or citizens to hear,
sensation dans l’auditoire.-RRB-

<p/>```I suppose Carpezan wearied the poor fellow's existence out. Certain it
is he (<font color='blue'><b>Carpezan</b></font>) has been miserable for weeks past; and a change of air and scene
may do him (<font color='blue'><b>Carpezan</b></font>) good. This morning, quite early, he (<font color='blue'><b>Carpezan</b></font>) came to my room, and told
me he (<font color='blue'><b>Carpezan</b></font>) had taken a seat in the Portsmouth machine, and proposed to go to
the Isle of Wight, to the army there.'''

<p/>The army! Hetty looks very pale at this announcement, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) mother
continues:

<p/>```And a little portion of it, namely, the thirty-second regiment, is
commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel Richmond Webb--the nephew of the famous
old General under whom my grandfather Esmond served in the great wars of
Marlborough. Mr. Webb met us at our uncle's, accosting us very politely,
and giving us an invitation to visit him (<font color='blue'><b>Webb</b></font>) at his (<font color='blue'><b>Webb</b></font>) regiment. Let my poor
brother go and listen to his (<font color='blue'><b>Webb</b></font>) darling music of fife and drum! He (<font color='blue'><b>Webb</b></font>) bade me
tell the ladies that they should hear from him (<font color='blue'><b>Webb</b></font>). I kiss their hands, and
go to dress for dinner, at the Star and Garter, in Pall Mall. We are to
have Mr. Soame Jenyns, Mr. Cambridge, Mr. Walpole, possibly, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) is
not too fine to dine in a tavern; a young Irishman, a Mr. Bourke, who
they say is a wonder of eloquence and learning--in fine, all the wits of
Mr. Dodsley's shop. Quick, Gumbo, a coach, and my French grey suit! And
if gentlemen ask me, `Who gave you that sprig of lilac you wear on your
heart-side?' I shall call a bumper, and give Lilac for a toast.'''

<p/>I fear there is no more rest for Hetty on this night than on the
previous one, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) had behaved so mutinously to poor Harry
Warrington. Some secret resolution must have inspired that gentleman,
for, after leaving Mr. Lambert's table, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) paced the streets for
a while, and appeared at a late hour in the evening at Madame de
Bernstein's house in Clarges Street. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) ladyship's health had been
somewhat ailing of late, so that even her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) favourite routs were denied
her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) was sitting over a quiet game of ecarte, with a divine of
whom our last news were from a lock-up house hard by that in which Harry
Warrington had been himself confined. George, at Harry's request, had
paid the little debt under which Mr. Sampson had suffered temporarily.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) had been at his (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) living for a year. He (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) may have paid and contracted
ever so many debts, have been in and out of jail many times since we saw
him (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>). For some time past he (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) had been back in London stout and hearty
as usual, and ready for any invitation to cards or claret. Madame de
Bernstein did not care to have her (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) game interrupted by her (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) nephew, whose
conversation had little interest now for the fickle old woman. Next to
the very young, I suppose the very old are the most selfish. Alas, the
heart hardens as the blood ceases to run. The cold snow strikes down
from the head, and checks the glow of feeling. Who wants to survive
into old age after abdicating all his (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>) faculties one by one, and be sans
teeth, sans eyes, sans memory, sans hope, sans sympathy? How fared it
with those patriarchs of old who lived for their nine centuries, and
when were life's conditions so changed that, after threescore years and
ten, it became but a vexation and a burden?

<p/>Getting no reply but Yes and No to his (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>) brief speeches, poor Harry sat a
while on a couch opposite his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) aunt, who shrugged her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) shoulders, had her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>)
back to her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) nephew, and continued her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) game with the chaplain. Sampson
sat opposite Mr. Warrington, and could see that something disturbed him (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>).
His (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) face was very pale, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) countenance disturbed and full of gloom.
<div class="bookquote">``Something has happened to him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>), ma’am,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) whispered to the Baroness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Bah!''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) shrugged her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) shoulders again, and continued to deal her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>)
cards. <div class="bookquote">``What is the matter with you, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) at last said, at a pause
in the game, <div class="bookquote">``that you have such a dismal countenance? Chaplain, that
last game makes us even, I think!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry got up from his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) place. <div class="bookquote">``I am going on a journey: I am come to bid
you good-bye, aunt,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said, in a very tragical voice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``On a journey! Are you going home to America? I mark the king, Chaplain,
and play him (<font color='blue'><b>Chaplain</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div><p/>No, Harry said: he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was not going to America yet going to the Isle of
Wight for the present.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed!--a lovely spot!''  (<font color='red'><b>the Baroness</b></font>)</div>says the Baroness. <div class="bookquote">``Bon jour, mon ami, et bon
voyage!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) kissed a hand to her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) nephew.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I mayn't come back for some time, aunt,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) groaned out.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed! We shall be inconsolable without you! Unless you have a spade,
Mr. Sampson, the game is mine. Good-bye, my child! No more about your
journey at present: tell us about it when you come back!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) gaily
bade him (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) farewell. He (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) looked for a moment piteously at her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>), and was
gone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Something grave has happened, madam,''  (<font color='red'><b>the chaplain</b></font>)</div>says the chaplain.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! The boy is always getting into scrapes! I suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) has been
falling in love with one of those country girls--what are their names,
Lamberts?--with whom he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) is ever dawdling about. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) has been doing no
good here for some time. I am disappointed in him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), really quite grieved
about him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)--I will take two cards, if you please--again?--quite grieved.
What do you think they say of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) cousin--the Miss Warrington who made
eyes at him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) when she (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was a prize--they say the King has
remarked her (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), and the Yarmouth is creving with rage. He (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>), be!--those
methodistical Warringtons! They are not a bit less worldly than
their neighbours; and, old as he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) is, if the Grand Seignior throws his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>)
pocket-handkerchief, they will jump to catch it!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, madam; how your ladyship knows the world!''  (<font color='red'><b>the chaplain</b></font>)</div>sighs the chaplain. <div class="bookquote">``I
propose, if you please!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have lived long enough in it, Mr. Sampson, to know something of
it. `Tis sadly selfish, my dear sir, sadly selfish; and everybody is
struggling to pass his (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) neighbour! No, I can't give you any more cards.
You haven't the king? I play queen, knave, and a ten,--a sadly selfish
world, indeed. And here comes my chocolate!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div><p/>The more immediate interest of the cards entirely absorbs the old woman.
The door shuts out her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) nephew and his (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) cares. Under his (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) hat, he (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) bears
them into the street, and paces the dark town for a while.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good God!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) thinks, <div class="bookquote">``what a miserable fellow I am, and what a
spendthrift of my life I have been! I sit silent with George and his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
friends. I am not clever and witty as he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) is. I am only a burthen to
him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>); and, if I would help him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) ever so much, don't know how. My dear Aunt
Lambert's kindness never tires, but I begin to be ashamed of trying it.
Why, even Hetty can't help turning on me; and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) tells me I am
idle and should be doing something, ought I to be angry? The rest have
left me. There's my cousins and uncle and my lady my aunt, they have
shown me the cold shoulder this long time. They didn't even ask me to
Norfolk when they went down to the country, and offer me so much as
a day's partridge-shooting. I can't go to Castlewood--after what has
happened; I should break that scoundrel William's bones; and, faith, am
well out of the place altogether.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) laughs a fierce laugh as he (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) recalls his (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) adventures since he (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) has been
in Europe. Money, friends, pleasure, all have passed away, and he (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) feels
the past like a dream. He (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) strolls into White's Chocolate-House, where
the waiters have scarce seen him (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) for a year. The parliament is up.
Gentlemen are away; there is not even any play going on:--not that he (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>)
would join it, if there were.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) has but a few pieces in his (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) pocket; George's drawer is open, and he (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>)
may take what money he (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) likes thence; but very, very sparingly will he (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>)
avail himself of his (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) brother's repeated invitation. He (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) sits and drinks
his (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) glass in moody silence. Two or three officers of the Guards enter
from St. James's. He (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) knew them in former days, and the young men, who
have been already dining and drinking on guard, insist on more drink at
the club. The other battalion of their regiment is at Winchester: it is
going on this great expedition, no one knows whither, which everybody
is talking about. Cursed fate that they do not belong to the other
battalion; and must stay and do duty in London and at Kensington! There
is Webb, who was of their regiment: he (<font color='blue'><b>Webb</b></font>) did well to exchange his (<font color='blue'><b>Webb</b></font>) company
in the Coldstreams for the lieutenant-colonelcy of the thirty-second.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Webb</b></font>) will be of the expedition. Why, everybody is going; and the young
gentlemen mention a score of names of men of the first birth and fashion
who have volunteered. <div class="bookquote">``It ain't Hanoverians this time, commanded by the
big Prince,''  (<font color='red'><b>gentleman</b></font>)</div>says one young gentleman -LRB-whose relatives may have been
Tories forty years ago-RRB---<div class="bookquote">``it's Englishmen, with the Guards at the head
of `em, and a Marlborough for a leader! Will the Frenchmen ever stand
against them? No, by George, they are irresistible.''  (<font color='red'><b>relatives Tories</b></font>)</div>And a fresh bowl is
called, and loud toasts are drunk to the success of the expedition.

<p/>Mr. Warrington, who is a cup too low, the young Guardsmen say, walks
away when they are not steady enough to be able to follow him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>), thinks
over the matter on his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) way to his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) lodgings, and lies thinking of it all
through the night.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is it, my boy?''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>asks George Warrington of his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) brother, when the
latter enters his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) chamber very early on a blushing May morning.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I want a little money out of the drawer,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>says Harry, looking at his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
brother. <div class="bookquote">``I am sick and tired of London.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good heavens! Can anybody be tired of London?''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>George asks, who has
reasons for thinking it the most delightful place in the world.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am for one. I am sick and ill,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>says Harry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You and Hetty have been quarrelling?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) don't care a penny-piece about me, nor I for her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) neither,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>says
Harry, nodding his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``But I am ill, and a little country air will
do me good,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) mentions how he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) thinks of going to visit Mr. Webb in
the Isle of Wight, and how a Portsmouth coach starts from Holborn.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There's the till, Harry,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>says George, pointing from his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) bed. <div class="bookquote">``Put your
hand in, and take what you will. What a lovely morning, and how fresh
the Bedford House garden looks!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``God bless you, brother!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>Harry says.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have a good time, Harry!''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>and down goes George's head on the pillow
again, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) takes his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) pencil and notebook from under his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) bolster,
and falls to polishing his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) verses, as Harry, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) cloak over his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
shoulder and a little valise in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hand, walks to the inn in Holborn
whence the Portsmouth machine starts.




<p/>CHAPTER LXIII. Melpomene


<p/>George Warrington by no means allowed his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) legal studies to obstruct
his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) comfort and pleasures, or interfere with his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) precious health. Madam
Esmond had pointed out to him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) letters that though he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) wore
a student's gown, and sate down with a crowd of nameless people to
hall-commons, he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) had himself a name, and a very ancient one, to support,
and could take rank with the first persons at home or in his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) own
country; and desired that he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) would study as a gentleman, not a mere
professional drudge. With this injunction the young man complied
obediently enough: so that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) may be said not to have belonged to the
rank and file of the law, but may be considered to have been a volunteer
in her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) service, like some young gentlemen of whom we have just heard.
Though not so exacting as she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) since has become--though she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) allowed her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
disciples much more leisure, much more pleasure, much more punch, much
more frequenting of coffee-houses and holiday-making, than she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) admits
nowadays, when she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) scarce gives her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) votaries time for amusement,
recreation, instruction, sleep, or dinner--the law a hundred years ago
was still a jealous mistress, and demanded a pretty exclusive attention.
Murray, we are told, might have been an Ovid, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Murray</b></font>) preferred to be
Lord Chief Justice, and to wear ermine instead of bays. Perhaps Mr.
Warrington might have risen to a peerage and the woolsack, had he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>)
studied very long and assiduously,--had he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) been a dexterous courtier,
and a favourite of attorneys: had he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) been other than he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) was, in a word.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) behaved to Themis with a very decent respect and attention; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>)
loved letters more than law always; and the black-letter of Chaucer was
infinitely more agreeable to him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) than the Gothic pages of Hale and Coke.

<p/>Letters were loved indeed in those quaint times, and authors were
actually authorities. Gentlemen appealed to Virgil or Lucan in the
Courts or the House of Commons. What said Statius, Juvenal--let alone
Tully or Tacitus--on such and such a point? Their reign is over now, the
good old Heathens: the worship of Jupiter and Juno is not more out
of mode than the cultivation of Pagan poetry or ethics. The age of
economists and calculators has succeeded, and Tooke's Pantheon is
deserted and ridiculous. Now and then, perhaps, a Stanley kills a kid,
a Gladstone bangs up a wreath, a Lytton burns incense, in honour of
the Olympians. But what do they care at Lambeth, Birmingham, the Tower
Hamlets, for the ancient rites, divinities, worship? Who the plague are
the Muses, and what is the use of all that Greek and Latin rubbish? What
is Elicon, and who cares? Who was Thalia, pray, and what is the length
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Thalia</b></font>) i? Is Melpomene's name in three syllables or four? And do you
know from whose design I stole that figure of Tragedy which adorns the
initial G of this chapter?

<p/>Now, it has been said how Mr. George in his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) youth, and in the long
leisure which he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) enjoyed at home, and during his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) imprisonment in the
French fort on the banks of Monongahela, had whiled away his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) idleness by
paying court to Melpomene; and the result of their union was a tragedy,
which has been omitted in Bell's Theatre, though I dare say it is no
worse than some of the pieces printed there. Most young men pay their
respects to the Tragic Muse first, as they fall in love with women who
are a great deal older than themselves. Let the candid reader own, if
ever he (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) had a literary turn, that his (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) ambition was of the very
highest, and that however, in his (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) riper age, he (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) might come down in his (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>)
pretensions, and think that to translate an ode of Horace, or to turn a
song of Waller or Prior into decent alcaics or sapphics, was about the
utmost of his (<font color='blue'><b>Waller</b></font>) capability, tragedy and epic only did his (<font color='blue'><b>Waller</b></font>) green unknowing
youth engage, and no prize but the highest was fit for him (<font color='blue'><b>Waller</b></font>).

<p/>George Warrington, then, on coming to London, attended the theatrical
performances at both houses, frequented the theatrical coffee-houses,
and heard the opinions of the critics, and might be seen at the Bedford
between the plays, or supping at the Cecil along with the wits and
actors when the performances were over. Here he (<font color='blue'><b>Cecil</b></font>) gradually became
acquainted with the players and such of the writers and poets as were
known to the public. The tough old Macklin, the frolicsome Foote,
the vivacious Hippisley, the sprightly Mr. Garrick himself, might
occasionally be seen at these houses of entertainment; and our
gentleman, by his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) wit and modesty, as well, perhaps, as for the high
character for wealth which he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) possessed, came to be very much liked in
the coffee-house circles, and found that the actors would drink a
bowl of punch with him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>), and the critics sup at his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) expense with great
affability. To be on terms of intimacy with an author or an actor has
been an object of delight to many a young man; actually to hob and nob
with Bobadil or Henry the Fifth or Alexander the Great, to accept a
pinch out of Aristarchus's own box, to put Juliet into her (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) coach, or
hand Monimia to her (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) chair, are privileges which would delight most young
men of a poetic turn; and no wonder George Warrington loved the theatre.
Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) had the satisfaction of thinking that his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) mother only half
approved of plays and playhouses, and of feasting on fruit forbidden at
home. He (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) gave more than one elegant entertainment to the players, and it
was even said that one or two distinguished geniuses had condescended to
borrow money of him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>).

<p/>And as he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) polished and added new beauties to his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) masterpiece, we may be
sure that he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) took advice of certain friends of his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>), and that they gave
him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) applause and counsel. Mr. Spencer, his (<font color='blue'><b>Spencer</b></font>) new acquaintance, of the
Temple, gave a breakfast at his (<font color='blue'><b>Spencer</b></font>) chambers in Fig Tree Court, when Mr.
Warrington read part of his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) play, and the gentlemen present pronounced
that it had uncommon merit. Even the learned Mr. Johnson, who was
invited, was good enough to say that the piece had showed talent. It
warred against the unities, to be sure; but these had been violated
by other authors, and Mr. Warrington might sacrifice them as well as
another. There was in Mr. W.'s tragedy a something which reminded him (<font color='blue'><b>W.</b></font>)
both of Coriolanus and Othello. <div class="bookquote">``And two very good things too, sir!''  (<font color='red'><b>the author</b></font>)</div>the
author pleaded. <div class="bookquote">``Well, well, there was no doubt on that point; and `tis
certain your catastrophe is terrible, just, and being in part true, is
not the less awful,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Spencer/Spencer</b></font>)</div>remarks Mr. Spencer.

<p/>Now the plot of Mr. Warrington's tragedy was quite full indeed of battle
and murder. A favourite book of his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) grandfather had been the life of old
George Frundsberg of Mindelheim, a colonel of foot-folk in the Imperial
service at Pavia fight, and during the wars of the Constable Bourbon:
and one of Frundsberg's military companions was a certain Carpzow, or
Carpezan, whom our friend selected as his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) tragedy hero. His (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) first
act, as it at present stands in Sir George Warrington's manuscript,
is supposed to take place before a convent on the Rhine, which the
Lutherans, under Carpezan, are besieging. A godless gang these Lutherans
are. They have pulled the beards of Roman friars, and torn the veils of
hundreds of religious women. A score of these are trembling within the
walls of the convent yonder, of which the garrison, unless the expected
succours arrive before midday, has promised to surrender. Meanwhile
there is armistice, and the sentries within look on with hungry eyes, as
the soldiers and camp people gamble on the grass before the gate. Twelve
o’clock, ding, ding, dong! it sounds upon the convent bell. No succours
have arrived. Open gates, warder! and give admission to the famous
Protestant hero, the terror of Turks on the Danube, and Papists in the
Lombard plains--Colonel Carpezan! See, here he (<font color='blue'><b>Carpezan</b></font>) comes, clad in complete
steel, his (<font color='blue'><b>Carpezan</b></font>) hammer of battle over his (<font color='blue'><b>Carpezan</b></font>) shoulder, with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Carpezan</b></font>) has
battered so many infidel sconces, his (<font color='blue'><b>Carpezan</b></font>) flags displayed, his (<font color='blue'><b>Carpezan</b></font>) trumpets
blowing. <div class="bookquote">``No rudeness, my men,''  (<font color='red'><b>Carpezan/Lord Carpezan</b></font>)</div>says Carpezan; <div class="bookquote">``the wine is yours,
and the convent larder and cellar are good: the church plate shall
be melted: any of the garrison who choose to take service with Gaspar
Carpezan are welcome, and shall have good pay. No insult to the
religious ladies! I have promised them a safe-conduct, and he (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) who lays a
finger on them, hangs! Mind that Provost Marshal!''  (<font color='red'><b>Carpezan/Lord Carpezan</b></font>)</div>The Provost Marshal,
a huge fellow in a red doublet, nods his (<font color='blue'><b>Marshal</b></font>) head.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We shall see more of that Provost Marshal, or executioner,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Spencer/Spencer</b></font>)</div>Mr. Spencer
explains to his (<font color='blue'><b>Spencer</b></font>) guests.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A very agreeable acquaintance, I am sure,--shall be delighted to meet
the gentleman again!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Johnson/Johnson</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Johnson, wagging his (<font color='blue'><b>Johnson</b></font>) head over his (<font color='blue'><b>Johnson</b></font>) tea.
<div class="bookquote">``This scene of the mercenaries, the camp followers, and their wild
sports, is novel and stirring, Mr. Warrington, and I make you my
compliments on it. The Colonel has gone into the convent, I think? Now
let us hear what he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) is going to do there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The Abbess</b></font>)</div><p/>The Abbess, and one or two of her (<font color='blue'><b>Turks</b></font>) oldest ladies, make their appearance
before the conqueror. Conqueror as he (<font color='blue'><b>Conqueror</b></font>) is, they heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Conqueror</b></font>) in their
sacred halls. They have heard of his (<font color='blue'><b>Conqueror</b></font>) violent behaviour in conventual
establishments before. That hammer, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Conqueror</b></font>) always carries in action,
has smashed many sacred images in religious houses. Pounds and pounds of
convent plate is he (<font color='blue'><b>Conqueror</b></font>) known to have melted, the sacrilegious plunderer! No
wonder the Abbess-Princess of St. Mary's, a lady of violent prejudices,
free language, and noble birth, has a dislike to the lowborn heretic who
lords it in her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) convent, and tells Carpezan a bit of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) mind, as the
phrase is. This scene, in which the lady gets somewhat better of the
Colonel, was liked not a little by Mr. Warrington's audience at the
Temple. Terrible as he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) might be in war, Carpezan was shaken at first by
the Abbess's brisk opening charge of words; and, conqueror as he (<font color='blue'><b>Carpezan</b></font>) was,
seemed at first to be conquered by his (<font color='blue'><b>Carpezan</b></font>) actual prisoner. But such an old
soldier was not to be beaten ultimately by any woman. <div class="bookquote">``Pray, madam,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>says he (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``how many ladies are there in your convent, for whom my people
shall provide conveyance?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>The Abbess, with a look of much trouble and
anger, says that, <div class="bookquote">``besides herself, the noble sisters of Saint Mary's
House are twenty--twenty-three.''  (<font color='red'><b>The Abbess</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was going to say twenty-four, and
now says twenty-three? <div class="bookquote">``Ha! why this hesitation?''  (<font color='red'><b>Captain</b></font>)</div>asks Captain Ulric,
one of Carpezan's gayest officers.

<p/>The dark chief pulls a letter from his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) pocket. <div class="bookquote">``I require from you,
madam,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) says sternly to the Lady Abbess, <div class="bookquote">``the body of the noble lady
Sybilla of Hoya. Her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) brother was my favourite captain, slain by my side,
in the Milanese. By his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) death, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) becomes heiress of his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) lands. `Tis
said a greedy uncle brought her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) hither; and fast immured the lady
against her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) will. The damsel shall herself pronounce her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) fate--to stay a
cloistered sister of Saint Mary's, or to return to home and liberty, as
Lady Sybil, Baroness of ------.''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Abbess</b></font>)</div>Ha! The Abbess was greatly disturbed
by this question. She (<font color='blue'><b>Abbess</b></font>) says, haughtily: <div class="bookquote">``There is no Lady Sybil in this
house: of which every inmate is under your protection, and sworn to go
free. The Sister Agnes was a nun professed, and what was her (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) land and
wealth revert to this Order.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Give me straightway the body of the Lady Sybil of Hoya!''  (<font color='red'><b>Carpezan/Lord Carpezan</b></font>)</div>roars
Carpezan, in great wrath. <div class="bookquote">``If not, I make a signal to my Reiters, and
give you and your convent up to war.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Faith, if I lead the storm, and have my right, `tis not my Lady Abbess
that I'll choose,''  (<font color='red'><b>Captain</b></font>)</div>says Captain Ulric, <div class="bookquote">``but rather some plump, smiling,
red-lipped maid like--like--''  (<font color='red'><b>Ulric</b></font>)</div>Here, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>), the sly fellow, is looking
under the veils of the two attendant nuns, the stern Abbess cries,
<div class="bookquote">``Silence, fellow, with thy ribald talk! The lady, warrior, whom you ask
of me is passed away from sin, temptation, vanity, and three days since
our Sister Agnes--died.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Abbess</b></font>)</div><p/>At this announcement Carpezan is immensely agitated. The Abbess calls
upon the chaplain to confirm her (<font color='blue'><b>Abbess</b></font>) statement. Ghastly and pale, the old
man has to own that three days since the wretched Sister Agnes was
buried.

<p/>This is too much! In the pocket of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) coat of mail Carpezan has a
letter from Sister Agnes herself, in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Sister</b></font>) announces that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sister</b></font>) is
going to be buried indeed, but in an oubliette of the convent, where
she (<font color='blue'><b>Sister</b></font>) may either be kept on water and bread, or die starved outright. He (<font color='blue'><b>Carpezan</b></font>)
seizes the unflinching Abbess by the arm, whilst Captain Ulric lays hold
of the chaplain by the throat. The Colonel blows a blast upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) horn:
in rush his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) furious Lanzknechts from without. Crash, bang! They knock
the convent walls about. And in the midst of flames, screams, and
slaughter, who is presently brought in by Carpezan himself, and fainting
on his (<font color='blue'><b>Carpezan</b></font>) shoulder, but Sybilla herself? A little sister nun -LRB-that gay one
with the red lips-RRB- had pointed out to the Colonel and Ulric the way to
Sister Agnes's dungeon, and, indeed, had been the means of making her (<font color='blue'><b>Sister</b></font>)
situation known to the Lutheran chief.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The convent is suppressed with a vengeance,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Warrington. <div class="bookquote">``We
end our first act with the burning of the place, the roars of triumph
of the soldiery, and the outcries of the nuns. They had best go change
their dresses immediately, for they will have to be court ladies in the
next act--as you will see.''  (<font color='red'><b>the gentlemen</b></font>)</div>Here the gentlemen talked the matter over.
If the piece were to be done at Drury Lane, Mrs. Pritchard would hardly
like to be Lady Abbess, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Abbess</b></font>) doth but appear in the first act. Miss
Pritchard might make a pretty Sybilla, and Miss Gates the attendant
nun. Mr. Garrick was scarce tall enough for Carpezan--though, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Carpezan</b></font>)
is excited, nobody ever thinks of him (<font color='blue'><b>Carpezan</b></font>) but as big as a grenadier. Mr.
Johnson owns Woodward will be a good Ulric, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodward</b></font>) plays the Mercutio
parts very gaily; and so, by one and t'other, the audience fancies the
play already on the boards, and casts the characters.

<p/>In act the second, Carpezan has married Sybilla. He (<font color='blue'><b>Carpezan</b></font>) has enriched himself
in the wars, has been ennobled by the Emperor, and lives at his (<font color='blue'><b>Emperor</b></font>) castle
on the Danube in state and splendour.

<p/>But, truth to say, though married, rich, and ennobled, the Lord Carpezan
was not happy. It may be that in his (<font color='blue'><b>Carpezan</b></font>) wild life, as leader of condottieri
on both sides, he (<font color='blue'><b>Carpezan</b></font>) had committed crimes which agitated his (<font color='blue'><b>Carpezan</b></font>) mind with
remorse. It may be that his (<font color='blue'><b>Carpezan</b></font>) rough soldier-manners consorted ill with his (<font color='blue'><b>Carpezan</b></font>)
imperious highborn bride. She (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) led him (<font color='blue'><b>Carpezan</b></font>) such a life--I am narrating as
it were the Warrington manuscript, which is too long to print in
entire--taunting him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) low birth, his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) vulgar companions, whom the
old soldier loved to see about him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>), and so forth--that there were
times when he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) rather wished that he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) had never rescued this lovely,
quarrelsome, wayward vixen from the oubliette out of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) fished
her (<font color='blue'><b>vixen</b></font>). After the bustle of the first act this is a quiet one, and passed
chiefly in quarrelling between the Baron and Baroness Carpezan, until
horns blow, and it is announced that the young King of Bohemia and
Hungary is coming bunting that way.

<p/>Act III. is passed at Prague, whither his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) Majesty has invited Lord
Carpezan and his (<font color='blue'><b>Carpezan</b></font>) wife, with noble offers of preferment to the latter.
From Baron he (<font color='blue'><b>Baron</b></font>) shall be promoted to be Count, from Colonel he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) shall be
General-in-Chief. His (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) wife is the most brilliant and fascinating of all
the ladies of the court--and as for Carpzoff--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, stay--I have it--I know your story, sir, now,''  (<font color='red'><b>the ladies</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Johnson.
```Tis in `Meteranus,' in the Theatrum Universum. I read it in Oxford as
a boy--Carpezanus or Carpzoff--''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That is the fourth act,''  (<font color='red'><b>a boy Carpezanus</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Warrington. In the fourth act the
young King's attentions towards Sybilla grow more and more marked; but
her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) husband, battling against his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) jealousy, long refuses to yield to it,
until his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) wife's criminality is put beyond a doubt--and here he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) read
the act, which closes with the terrible tragedy which actually happened.
Being convinced of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) wife's guilt, Carpezan caused the executioner who
followed his (<font color='blue'><b>Carpezan</b></font>) regiment to slay her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) own palace. And the curtain of
the act falls just after the dreadful deed is done, in a side-chamber
illuminated by the moon shining through a great oriel window, under
which the King comes with his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) lute, and plays the song which was to be
the signal between him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) guilty victim.

<p/>This song -LRB-writ in the ancient style, and repeated in the piece, being
sung in the third act previously at a great festival given by the King
and Queen-RRB- was pronounced by Mr. Johnson to be a happy imitation of Mr.
Waller's manner, and its gay repetition at the moment of guilt, murder,
and horror, very much deepened the tragic gloom of the scene.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But whatever came afterwards?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) asked. <div class="bookquote">``I remember in the Theatrum,
Carpezan is said to have been taken into favour again by Count
Mansfield, and doubtless to have murdered other folks on the reformed
side.''

 (<font color='red'><b>poet</b></font>)</div><p/>Here our poet has departed from historic truth. In the fifth act
of Carpezan King Louis of Hungary and Bohemia -LRB-sufficiently
terror-stricken, no doubt, by the sanguinary termination of his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>)
intrigue-RRB- has received word that the Emperor Solyman is invading his (<font color='blue'><b>Emperor</b></font>)
Hungarian dominions. Enter two noblemen who relate how, in the
council which the King held upon the news, the injured Carpezan rushed
infuriated into the royal presence, broke his (<font color='blue'><b>Carpezan</b></font>) sword, and flung it at the
King's feet--along with a glove which he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) dared him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) to wear, and which he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>)
swore he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) would one day claim. After that wild challenge the rebel fled
from Prague, and had not since been heard of; but it was reported that
he (<font color='blue'><b>rebel</b></font>) had joined the Turkish invader, assumed the turban, and was now
in the camp of the Sultan, whose white tents glance across the river
yonder, and against whom the King was now on his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) march. Then the King
comes to his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) tent with his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) generals, prepares his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) order of battle; and
dismisses them to their posts, keeping by his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) side an aged and faithful
knight, his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) master of the horse, to whom he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) expresses his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) repentance
for his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) past crimes, his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) esteem for his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) good and injured Queen, and his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>)
determination to meet the day's battle like a man.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is this field called?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mohacz, my liege!''  (<font color='red'><b>the warrior</b></font>)</div>says the old warrior, adding the remark that <div class="bookquote">``Ere
set of sun, Mohacz will see a battle bravely won.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the warrior</b></font>)</div><p/>Trumpets and alarms now sound; they are the cymbals and barbaric music
of the Janissaries: we are in the Turkish camp, and yonder, surrounded
by turbaned chiefs, walks the Sultan Solyman's friend, the conqueror of
Rhodes, the redoubted Grand Vizier.

<p/>Who is that warrior in an Eastern habit, but with a glove in his (<font color='blue'><b>warrior</b></font>) cap?
`Tis Carpezan. Even Solyman knew his (<font color='blue'><b>warrior</b></font>) courage and ferocity as a soldier.
He (<font color='blue'><b>warrior</b></font>) knows; the ordnance of the Hungarian host; in what arms King Louis
is weakest: how his (<font color='blue'><b>Louis</b></font>) cavalry, of which the shock is tremendous, should
be received, and inveigled into yonder morass, where certain death may
await them--he (<font color='blue'><b>Louis</b></font>) prays for a command in the front, and as near as possible
to the place where the traitor King Louis will engage. ```Tis well,'' says
the grim Vizier, <div class="bookquote">``our invincible Emperor surveys the battle from yonder
tower. At the end of the day, he (<font color='blue'><b>Emperor</b></font>) will know how to reward your valour.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The signal-guns fire--the trumpets blow--the Turkish captains retire,
vowing death to the infidel, and eternal fidelity to the Sultan.

<p/>And now the battle begins in earnest, and with those various incidents
which the lover of the theatre knoweth. Christian knights and Turkish
warriors clash and skirmish over the stage. Continued alarms are
sounded. Troops on both sides advance and retreat. Carpezan, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Carpezan</b></font>)
glove in his (<font color='blue'><b>Carpezan</b></font>) cap, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Carpezan</b></font>) dreadful hammer smashing all before him (<font color='blue'><b>Carpezan</b></font>), rages
about the field, calling for King Louis. The renegade is about to slay
a warrior who faces him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>), but recognising young Ulric, his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) ex-captain, he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>)
drops the uplifted hammer, and bids him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) fly, and think of Carpezan. He (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>)
is softened at seeing his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) young friend, and thinking of former times
when they fought and conquered together in the cause of Protestantism.
Ulric bids him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) to return, but of course that is now out of the question.
They fight. Ulric will have it, and down he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) goes under the hammer. The
renegade melts in sight of his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) wounded comrade, when who appears but
King Louis, his (<font color='blue'><b>Louis</b></font>) plumes torn, his (<font color='blue'><b>Louis</b></font>) sword hacked, his (<font color='blue'><b>Louis</b></font>) shield dented with
a thousand blows which he (<font color='blue'><b>Louis</b></font>) has received and delivered during the day's
battle. Ha! who is this? The guilty monarch would turn away -LRB-perhaps
Macbeth may have done so before-RRB-, but Carpezan is on him (<font color='blue'><b>Carpezan</b></font>). All his (<font color='blue'><b>Carpezan</b></font>)
softness is gone. He (<font color='blue'><b>Carpezan</b></font>) rages like a fury. <div class="bookquote">``An equal fight!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Carpezan</b></font>) roars. <div class="bookquote">``A
traitor against a traitor! Stand, King Louis! False King, false knight,
false friend--by this glove in my helmet, I challenge you!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Carpezan</b></font>) tears
the guilty token out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Carpezan</b></font>) cap, and flings it at the King.

<p/>Of course they set to, and the monarch falls under the terrible arm of
the man whom he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has injured. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) dies, uttering a few incoherent words
of repentance, and Carpezan, leaning upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Carpezan</b></font>) murderous mace, utters a
heartbroken soliloquy over the royal corpse. The Turkish warriors have
gathered meanwhile: the dreadful day is their own. Yonder stands the
dark Vizier, surrounded by his (<font color='blue'><b>Carpezan</b></font>) Janissaries, whose bows and swords are
tired of drinking death. He (<font color='blue'><b>Carpezan</b></font>) surveys the renegade standing over the
corpse of the King.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Christian renegade!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) says, <div class="bookquote">``Allah has given us a great victory. The
arms of the Sublime Emperor are everywhere triumphant. The Christian
King is slain by you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Peace to his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) soul! He (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) died like a good knight,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ulric</b></font>)</div>gasps Ulric, himself
dying on the field.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``In this day's battle,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Vizier</b></font>)</div>the grim Vizier continues, <div class="bookquote">``no man hath
comported himself more bravely than you. You are made Bassa of
Transylvania! Advance bowmen--Fire!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Vizier</b></font>)</div><p/>An arrow quivers in the breast of Carpezan.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Bassa of Transylvania, you were a traitor to your King, who lies
murdered by your hand!''  (<font color='red'><b>Vizier</b></font>)</div>continues grim Vizier. <div class="bookquote">``You contributed more
than any soldier to this day's great victory. `Tis thus my sublime
Emperor meetly rewards you. Sound trumpets! We march for Vienna
to-night!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Carpezan/Lord Carpezan</b></font>)</div><p/>And the curtain drops as Carpezan, crawling towards his (<font color='blue'><b>Carpezan</b></font>) dying comrade,
kisses his (<font color='blue'><b>Carpezan</b></font>) hands, and gasps--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Forgive me, Ulric!''


 (<font color='red'><b>comrade kisses gasps</b></font>)</div><p/>When Mr. Warrington has finished reading his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) tragedy, he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) turns round to
Mr. Johnson, modestly, and asks,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What say you, sir? Is there any chance for me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Johnson/Johnson</b></font>)</div><p/>But the opinion of this most eminent critic is scarce to be given, for
Mr. Johnson had been asleep for some time, and frankly owned that he (<font color='blue'><b>Johnson</b></font>) had
lost the latter part of the play.

<p/>The little auditory begins to hum and stir as the noise of the speaker
ceased. George may have been very nervous when he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) first commenced to
read; but everybody allows that he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) read the last two acts uncommonly
well, and makes him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) a compliment upon his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) matter and manner. Perhaps
everybody is in good-humour because the piece has come to an end. Mr.
Spencer's servant hands about refreshing drinks. The Templars speak out
their various opinions whilst they sip the negus. They are a choice band
of critics, familiar with the pit of the theatre, and they treat Mr.
Warrington's play with the gravity which such a subject demands.

<p/>Mr. Fountain suggests that the Vizier should not say <div class="bookquote">``Fire!''  (<font color='red'><b>the Vizier</b></font>)</div>when he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>)
bids the archers kill Carpezan, as you certainly don't fire with a bow
and arrows. A note is taken of the objection.

<p/>Mr. Figtree, who is of a sentimental turn, regrets that Ulric could not
be saved, and married to the comic heroine.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, sir, there was an utter annihilation of the Hungarian army at
Mohacz,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Johnson/Johnson</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Johnson, <div class="bookquote">``and Ulric must take his (<font color='blue'><b>Emperor</b></font>) knock on the head
with the rest. He (<font color='blue'><b>Emperor</b></font>) could only be saved by flight, and you wouldn't have
a hero run away! Pronounce sentence of death against Captain Ulric, but
kill him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) with honours of war.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Johnson/Johnson</b></font>)</div><p/>Messrs. Essex and Tanfield wonder to one another who is this
queer-looking pert whom Spencer has invited, and who contradicts
everybody; and suggest a boat up the river and a little fresh air after
the fatigues of the tragedy.

<p/>The general opinion is decidedly favourable to Mr. Warrington's
performance; and Mr. Johnson's opinion, on which he (<font color='blue'><b>Johnson</b></font>) sets a special
value, is the most favourable of all. Perhaps Mr. Johnson is not sorry
to compliment a young gentleman of fashion and figure like Mr. W. <div class="bookquote">``Up to
the death of the heroine,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. W./Mr. Esmond W.</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>W.</b></font>) says, <div class="bookquote">``I am frankly with you, sir. And I
may speak, as a playwright who have killed my own heroine, and had my
share of the plausus in the atro. To hear your own lines nobly delivered
to an applauding house, is indeed a noble excitement. I like to see a
young man of good name and lineage who condescends to think that the
Tragic Muse is not below his (<font color='blue'><b>Muse</b></font>) advances. It was to a sordid roof that
I invited her (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>), and I asked her (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>) to rescue me from poverty and squalor.
Happy you, sir, who can meet her (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>) upon equal terms, and can afford to
marry her (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>) without a portion!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I doubt whether the greatest genius is not debased who has to make a
bargain with Poetry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Spencer/Spencer</b></font>)</div>remarks Mr. Spencer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Johnson/Johnson</b></font>)</div>Mr. Johnson answered, <div class="bookquote">``I doubt if many a great genius would
work at all without bribes and necessities; and so a man had better
marry a poor Muse for good and all, for better or worse, than dally with
a rich one. I make you my compliment to your play, Mr. Warrington, and
if you want an introduction to the stage, shall be very happy if I can
induce my friend Mr. Garrick to present you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Johnson/Johnson</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Garrick shall be his (<font color='blue'><b>Garrick</b></font>) sponsor,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Figtree</b></font>)</div>cried the florid Mr. Figtree.
<div class="bookquote">``Melpomene shall be his (<font color='blue'><b>Garrick</b></font>) godmother, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Garrick</b></font>) shall have the witches'
caldron in Macbeth for a christening font.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sir, I neither said font nor godmother!'' (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>--remarks the man of letters.
<div class="bookquote">``I would have no play contrary to morals or religion nor, as I conceive,
is Mr. Warrington's piece otherwise than friendly to them. Vice is
chastised, as it should be, even in kings, though perhaps we judge of
their temptations too lightly. Revenge is punished--as not to be lightly
exercised by our limited notion of justice. It may have been Carpezan's
wife who perverted the King, and not the King who led the woman astray.
At any rate, Louis is rightly humiliated for his (<font color='blue'><b>Louis</b></font>) crime, and the Renegade
most justly executed for his (<font color='blue'><b>Louis</b></font>). I wish you a good afternoon, gentlemen!''
 (<font color='red'><b>the author</b></font>)</div>And with these remarks, the great author took his (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) leave of the company.

<p/>Towards the close of the reading, General Lambert had made his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>)
appearance at Mr. Spencer's chambers, and had listened to the latter
part of the tragedy. The performance over, he (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) and George took their way
to the latter's lodgings in the first place, and subsequently to the
General's own house, where the young author was expected, in order to
recount the reception which his (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) play had met from his (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) Temple critics.

<p/>At Mr. Warrington's apartments in Southampton Row, they found a letter
awaiting George, which the latter placed in his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) pocket unread, so that
he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) might proceed immediately with his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) companion to Soho. We may be sure
the ladies there were eager to know about the Carpezan's fate in the
morning's small rehearsal.

<p/>Hetty said George was so shy, that perhaps it would be better for all
parties if some other person had read the play. Theo, on the contrary,
cried out:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Read it, indeed! Who can read a poem better than the author who feels
it in his (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) heart? And George had his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) whole heart in the piece!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Theo/Lady Theo</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Lambert very likely thought that somebody else's whole heart was in
the piece too, but did not utter this opinion to Miss Theo.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think Harry would look very well in your figure of a Prince,''
 (<font color='red'><b>the General</b></font>)</div>says the General. <div class="bookquote">``That scene where he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) takes leave of his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) wife before
departing for the wars reminds me of your brother's manner not a
little.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, papa! surely Mr. Warrington himself would act the Prince's part
best!''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Theo</b></font>)</div>cries Miss Theo.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And be deservedly slain in battle at the end?''  (<font color='red'><b>the father</b></font>)</div>asks the father of the
house.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I did not say that,--only that Mr. George would make a very good
Prince, papa!''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Theo</b></font>)</div>cries Miss Theo.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``In which case he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) would find a suitable Princess, I have no doubt. What
news of your brother Harry?''

 (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div><p/>George, who had been thinking about theatrical triumphs; about
monumentum aere perennius; about lilacs; about love whispered and
tenderly accepted, remembers that he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) has a letter from Harry in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
pocket, and gaily produces it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let us hear what Mr. Truant says for himself, Aunt Lambert!''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>cries
George, breaking the seal.

<p/>Why is he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) so disturbed, as he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) reads the contents of his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) letter? Why do
the women look at him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) with alarmed eyes? And why, above all, is Hetty so
pale?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here is the letter,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>says George, and begins to read it:


<p/>``RYDE, June 1, 1758.

<p/>``I did not tell my dearest George what I hoped and intended, when I left
home on Wednesday. `Twas to see Mr. Webb at Portsmouth or the Isle of
Wight, wherever his (<font color='blue'><b>Wight</b></font>) Regiment was, and if need was to go down on my
knees to him (<font color='blue'><b>Wight</b></font>) to take me as volunteer on the Expedition. I took boat from
Portsmouth, where I learned that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wight</b></font>) was with our regiment incampt at
the village of Ryde. Was received by him (<font color='blue'><b>Wight</b></font>) most kindly, and my petition
granted out of hand. That is why I say our regiment. We are eight
gentlemen volunteers with Mr. Webb, all men of birth, and good fortunes
except poor me, who don't deserve one. We are to mess with the officers;
we take the right of the collumn, and have always the right to be
in front, and in an hour we embark on board his (<font color='blue'><b>Webb</b></font>) Majesty's Ship the
Rochester of 60 guns, while our Commodore's, Mr. Howe's, is the Essex,
70. His (<font color='blue'><b>Howe</b></font>) squadron is about 20 ships, and I should think 100 transports at
least. Though `tis a secret expedition, we make no doubt France is our
destination--where I hope to see my friends the Monsieurs once more,
and win my colours, a la point de mon epee, as we used to say in Canada.
Perhaps my service as interpreter may be useful; I speaking the language
not so well as some one I know, but better than most here.

<p/>``I scarce venture to write to our mother to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) of this step. Will
you, who have a coxing tongue will wheadle any one, write to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) as soon
as you have finisht the famous tradgedy? Will you give my affectionate
respects to dear General Lambert and ladies? and if any accident should
happen, I know you will take care of poor Gumbo as belonging to my
dearest best George's most affectionate brother, HENRY E. WARRINGTON.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``P.S.--Love to all at home when you write, including Dempster, Mountain,
and Fanny M. and all the people, and duty to my honoured mother, wishing
I had pleased her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) better. And if I said anything unkind to dear Miss
Hester Lambert, I know she (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) will forgive me, and pray God bless all.--H.
E. W.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To G. Esmond Warrington, Esq., at Mr. Scrace's House in Southampton
Row, Opposite Bedford House Gardens, London.''


 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) has not read the last words with a very steady voice. Mr. Lambert
sits silent, though not a little moved. Theo and her (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) mother look at one
another; but Hetty remains with a cold face and a stricken heart. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
thinks, <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>House</b></font>) is gone to danger, perhaps to death, and it was I sent him (<font color='blue'><b>House</b></font>)!''




 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER LXIV. In which Harry lives to fight another Day


<p/>The trusty Gumbo could not console himself for the departure of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
beloved master: at least, to judge from his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) tears and howls on first
hearing the news of Mr. Harry's enlistment, you would have thought
the negro's heart must break at the separation. No wonder he (<font color='blue'><b>negro</b></font>) went for
sympathy to the maid-servants at Mr. Lambert's lodgings. Wherever that
dusky youth was, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) sought comfort in the society of females. Their fair
and tender bosoms knew how to feel pity for the poor African, and
the darkness of Gumbo's complexion was no more repulsive to them than
Othello's to Desdemona. I believe Europe has never been so squeamish
in regard to Africa, as a certain other respected Quarter. Nay, some
Africans--witness the Chevalier de St. Georges, for instance--have been
notorious favourites with the fair sex.

<p/>So, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Georges</b></font>) humbler walk, was Mr. Gumbo. The Lambert servants wept freely
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gumbo</b></font>) company; the maids kindly considered him (<font color='blue'><b>Gumbo</b></font>) not only as Mr. Harry's
man, but their brother. Hetty could not help laughing when she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) found
Gumbo roaring because his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) master had gone a volumteer, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) called it,
and had not taken him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was ready to save Master Harry's life any day,
and would have done it and had himself cut in twenty thousand hundred
pieces for Master Harry, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) would! Meanwhile, Nature must be
supported, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) condescended to fortify her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) by large supplies of beer
and cold meat in the kitchen. That he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was greedy, idle, and told lies,
is certain; but yet Hetty gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) half a crown, and was especially kind
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). Her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) tongue, that was wont to wag so pertly, was so gentle now,
that you might fancy it had never made a joke. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) moved about the house
mum and meek. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) was humble to mamma; thankful to John and Betty when
they waited at dinner; patient to Polly when the latter pulled her (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>) hair
in combing it; long-suffering when Charley from school trod on her (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>)
toes, or deranged her (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>) workbox; silent in papa's company,--oh, such a
transmogrified little Hetty! If papa had ordered her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) to roast the leg of
mutton, or walk to church arm-in-arm with Gumbo, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) would have made a
curtsey, and said, <div class="bookquote">``Yes, if you please, dear papa!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Leg of mutton! What
sort of meal were some poor volunteers having, with the cannon-balls
flying about their heads? Church! When it comes to the prayer in time of
war, oh, how her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) knees smite together as she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) kneels, and hides her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) head
in the pew! She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) holds down her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) head when the parson reads out, <div class="bookquote">``Thou
shalt do no murder,''  (<font color='red'><b>the parson</b></font>)</div>from the communion-rail, and fancies he (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) must be
looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>). How she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) thinks of all travellers by land or by water!
How she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) sickens as she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) runs to the paper to read if there is news of the
Expedition! How she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) watches papa when he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) comes home from his (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) Ordnance
Office, and looks in his (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) face to see if there is good news or bad! Is
he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) well? Is he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) made a General yet? Is he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) wounded and made a prisoner?
ah me! or, perhaps, are both his (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) legs taken off by one shot, like that
pensioner they saw in Chelsea Garden t'other day? She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) would go on wooden
legs all her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) life, if his (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) can but bring him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) safe home; at least, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
ought never to get up off her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) knees until he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) is returned. <div class="bookquote">``Haven't you
heard of people, Theo,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>says she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``whose hair has grown grey in a single
night? I shouldn't wonder if mine did,--shouldn't wonder in the least.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) looks in the glass to ascertain that phenomenon.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hetty dear, you used not to be so nervous when papa was away in
Minorca,''  (<font color='red'><b>Theo</b></font>)</div>remarks Theo.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, Theo! one may very well see that George is not with the army, but
safe at home,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hetty/Miss Hetty/Lambert</b></font>)</div>rejoins Hetty; whereat the elder sister blushes, and
looks very pensive. Au fait, if Mr. George had been in the army, that,
you see, would have been another pair of boots. Meanwhile, we don't
intend to harrow anybody's kind feelings any longer, but may as well
state that Harry is, for the present, as safe as any officer of the Life
Guards at Regent's Park Barracks.

<p/>The first expedition in which our gallant volunteer was engaged may be
called successful, but certainly was not glorious. The British Lion,
or any other lion, cannot always have a worthy enemy to combat, or a
battle-royal to deliver. Suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>Regent</b></font>) goes forth in quest of a tiger who
won't come, and lays his (<font color='blue'><b>Regent</b></font>) paws on a goose, and gobbles him (<font color='blue'><b>Regent</b></font>) up? Lions, we
know, must live like any other animals. But suppose, advancing into the
forest in search of the tiger aforesaid, and bellowing his (<font color='blue'><b>Regent</b></font>) challenge
of war, he (<font color='blue'><b>Regent</b></font>) espies not one but six tigers coming towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Regent</b></font>)? This
manifestly is not his (<font color='blue'><b>Regent</b></font>) game at all. He (<font color='blue'><b>Regent</b></font>) puts his (<font color='blue'><b>Regent</b></font>) tail between his (<font color='blue'><b>Regent</b></font>) royal
legs, and retreats into his (<font color='blue'><b>Regent</b></font>) own snug den as quickly as he (<font color='blue'><b>Regent</b></font>) may. Were he (<font color='blue'><b>Regent</b></font>)
to attempt to go and fight six tigers, you might write that Lion down an
Ass.

<p/>Now, Harry Warrington's first feat of war was in this wise. He (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) and about
13,000 other fighting men embarked in various ships and transports on
the 1st of June, from the Isle of Wight, and at daybreak on the 5th the
fleet stood in to the Bay of Cancale in Brittany. For a while he (<font color='blue'><b>Wight</b></font>) and the
gentlemen volunteers had the pleasure of examining the French coast
from their ships, whilst the Commander-in-Chief and the Commodore
reconnoitred the bay in a cutter. Cattle were seen, and some dragoons,
who trotted off into the distance; and a little fort with a couple
of guns had the audacity to fire at his (<font color='blue'><b>Commodore</b></font>) Grace of Marlborough and the
Commodore in the cutter. By two o’clock the whole British fleet was at
anchor, and signal was made for all the grenadier companies of eleven
regiments to embark on board flat-bottomed boats and assemble round the
Commodore's ship, the Essex. Meanwhile, Mr. Howe, hoisting his (<font color='blue'><b>Howe</b></font>) broad
pennant on board the Success frigate, went in as near as possible to
shore, followed by the other frigates, to protect the landing of
the troops; and, now, with Lord George Sackville and General Dury in
command, the gentlemen volunteers, the grenadier companies, and three
battalions of guards pulled to shore.

<p/>The gentlemen volunteers could not do any heroic deed upon this
occasion, because the French, who should have stayed to fight them, ran
away, and the frigates having silenced the fire of the little fort which
had disturbed the reconnaissance of the Commander-in-Chief, the army
presently assaulted it, taking the whole garrison prisoner, and shooting
him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) in the leg. Indeed, he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) was but one old gentleman, who gallantly had
fired his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) two guns, and who told his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) conquerors, <div class="bookquote">``If every Frenchman had
acted like me, you would not have landed at Cancale at all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>conquerors</b></font>)</div><p/>The advanced detachment of invaders took possession of the village of
Cancale, where they lay upon their arms all night; and our volunteer was
joked by his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) comrades about his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) eagerness to go out upon the war-path,
and bring in two or three scalps of Frenchmen. None such, however,
fell under his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) tomahawk; the only person slain on the whole day being a
French gentleman, who was riding with his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) servant, and was surprised
by volunteer Lord Downe, marching in the front with a company of
Kingsley's. My Lord Downe offered the gentleman quarter, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Downe</b></font>)
foolishly refused, whereupon he (<font color='blue'><b>Downe</b></font>), his (<font color='blue'><b>Downe</b></font>) servant, and the two horses, were
straightway shot.

<p/>Next day the whole force was landed, and advanced from Cancale to St.
Malo. All the villages were emptied through which the troops passed, and
the roads were so narrow in many places that the men had to march single
file, and might have been shot down from behind the tall leafy hedges
had there been any enemy to disturb them.

<p/>At nightfall the army arrived before St. Malo, and were saluted by
a fire of artillery from that town, which did little damage in the
darkness. Under cover of this, the British set fire to the ships, wooden
buildings, pitch and tar magazines in the harbour, and made a prodigious
conflagration that lasted the whole night.

<p/>This feat was achieved without any attempt on the part of the French to
molest the British force: but, as it was confidently asserted that there
was a considerable French force in the town of St. Malo, though they
wouldn't come out, his (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) Grace the Duke of Marlborough and my Lord George
Sackville determined not to disturb the garrison, marched back to
Cancale again, and--and so got on board their ships.

<p/>If this were not a veracious history, don't you see that it would have
been easy to send our Virginian on a more glorious campaign? Exactly
four weeks after his (<font color='blue'><b>Virginian</b></font>) departure from England, Mr. Warrington found
himself at Portsmouth again, and addressed a letter to his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) brother
George, with which the latter ran off to Dean Street so soon as ever he (<font color='blue'><b>Dean</b></font>)
received it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Glorious news, ladies!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>cries he (<font color='blue'><b>Dean</b></font>), finding the Lambert family all at
breakfast. <div class="bookquote">``Our champion has come back. He (<font color='blue'><b>champion</b></font>) has undergone all sorts of
dangers, but has survived them all. He (<font color='blue'><b>champion</b></font>) has seen dragons--upon my word,
he (<font color='blue'><b>champion</b></font>) says so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dragons! What do you mean, Mr. Warrington?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``But not killed any--he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) says so, as you shall hear. He (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) writes:

<p/>```DEAREST BROTHER--I think you will be glad to hear that I am returned,
without any commission as yet; without any wounds or glory; but,--at any
rate, alive and harty. On board our ship, we were almost as crowded as
poor Mr. Holwell and his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) friends in their Black Hole at Calicutta. We
had rough weather, and some of the gentlemen volunteers, who prefer
smooth water, grumbled not a little. My gentlemen's stomachs are dainty;
and after Braund's cookery and White's kick-shaws, they don't like plain
sailor's rum and bisket. But I, who have been at sea before, took my
rations and can of flip very contentedly: being determined to put a good
face on everything before our fine English macaronis, and show that a
Virginia gentleman is as good as the best of `em. I wish, for the honour
of old Virginia, that I had more to brag about. But all I can say in
truth is, that we have been to France and come back again. Why, I don't
think even your tragick pen could make anything of such a campaign as
ours has been. We landed on the 6 at Cancalle Bay, we saw a few dragons
on a hill...'

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There! Did I not tell you there were dragons?''  (<font color='red'><b>a dragons</b></font>)</div>asks George, laughing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mercy! What can he (<font color='blue'><b>ours</b></font>) mean by dragons?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hetty/Miss Hetty/Lambert</b></font>)</div>cries Hetty.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Immense, long-tailed monsters, with steel scales on their backs, who
vomit fire, and gobble up a virgin a day. Haven't you read about them in
The Seven Champions?''  (<font color='red'><b>papa</b></font>)</div>says papa. <div class="bookquote">``Seeing St. George's flag, I suppose,
they slunk off.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have read of `em,''  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div>says the little boy from Chartreux, solemnly.
<div class="bookquote">``They like to eat women. One was going to eat Andromeda, you know, papa;
and Jason killed another, who was guarding the apple-tree.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``... A few dragons on a hill,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>George resumes, <div class="bookquote">``who rode away from us
without engaging. We slept under canvass. We marched to St. Malo, and
burned ever so many privateers there. And we went on board shipp again,
without ever crossing swords with an enemy or meeting any except a
few poor devils whom the troops plundered. Better luck next time! This
hasn't been very much nor particular glorious: but I have liked it for
my part. I have smelt powder, besides a good deal of rosn and pitch we
burned. I've seen the enemy; have sleppt under canvass, and been dredful
crowdid and sick at sea. I like it. My best compliments to dear Aunt
Lambert, and tell Miss Hetty I wasn't very much fritened when I saw the
French horse.--Your most affectionate brother, H. E. WARRINGTON.''

 (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div><p/>We hope Miss Hetty's qualms of conscience were allayed by Harry's
announcement that his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) expedition was over, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had so far taken
no hurt. Far otherwise. Mr. Lambert, in the course of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) official
duties, had occasion to visit the troops at Portsmouth and the Isle of
Wight, and George Warrington bore him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) company. They found Harry vastly
improved in spirits and health from the excitement produced by the
little campaign, quite eager and pleased to learn his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) new military
duties, active, cheerful, and healthy, and altogether a different person
from the listless moping lad who had dawdled in London coffee-houses and
Mrs. Lambert's drawing-room. The troops were under canvas; the weather
was glorious, and George found his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) brother a ready pupil in a fine
brisk open-air school of war. Not a little amused, the elder brother,
arm-in-arm with the young volunteer, paced the streets of the warlike
city, recalled his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) own brief military experiences of two years back,
and saw here a much greater army than that ill-fated one of which he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)
had shared the disasters. The expedition, such as we have seen it, was
certainly not glorious, and yet the troops and the nation were in high
spirits with it. We were said to have humiliated the proud Gaul. We
should have vanquished as well as humbled him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) had he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) dared to appear.
What valour, after all, is like British valour? I dare say some such
expressions have been heard in later times. Not that I would hint that
our people brag much more than any other, or more now than formerly.
Have not these eyes beheld the battle-grounds of Leipzig, Jena, Dresden,
Waterloo, Blenheim, Bunker's Hill, New Orleans? What heroic nation has
not fought, has not conquered, has not run away, has not bragged in its
turn? Well, the British nation was much excited by the glorious victory
of St. Malo. Captured treasures were sent home and exhibited in London.
The people were so excited, that more laurels and more victories were
demanded, and the enthusiastic army went forth to seek some.

<p/>With this new expedition went a volunteer so distinguished, that we must
give him (<font color='blue'><b>Malo</b></font>) precedence of all other amateur soldiers or sailors. This was
our sailor Prince, H.R.H. Prince Edward, who was conveyed on board the
Essex in the ship's twelve-oared barge, the standard of England flying
in the bow of the boat, the Admiral with his (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>) flag and boat following the
Prince's, and all the captains following in seniority.

<p/>Away sails the fleet, Harry, in high health and spirits, waving his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hat
to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) friends as they cheer from the shore. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) must and will have his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
commission before long. There can be no difficulty about that, George
thinks. There is plenty of money in his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) little store to buy his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
brother's ensigncy; but if he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) can win it without purchase by gallantry
and good conduct, that were best. The colonel of the regiment reports
highly of his (<font color='blue'><b>colonel</b></font>) recruit; men and officers like him (<font color='blue'><b>colonel</b></font>). It is easy to see that
he (<font color='blue'><b>colonel</b></font>) is a young fellow of good promise and spirit.

<p/>Hip, hip, huzzay! What famous news are these which arrive ten days after
the expedition has sailed? On the 7th and 8th of August his (<font color='blue'><b>colonel</b></font>) Majesty's
troops had effected a landing in the Bay des Marais, two leagues
westward of Cherbourg, in the face of a large body of the enemy. Awed
by the appearance of British valour, that large body of the enemy has
disappeared. Cherbourg has surrendered at discretion; and the English
colours are hoisted on the three outlying forts. Seven-and-twenty ships
have been burned in the harbours, and a prodigious number of fine brass
cannon taken. As for your common iron guns, we have destroyed `em,
likewise the basin -LRB-about which the mounseers bragged so-RRB-, and the two
piers at the entrance to the harbour.

<p/>There is no end of jubilation in London; just as Mr. Howe's guns arrive
from Cherbourg, come Mr. Wolfe's colours captured at Louisbourg. The
colours are taken from Kensington to St Paul's, escorted by fourscore
life-guards and fourscore horse-grenadiers with officers in proportion,
their standards, kettle-drums, and trumpets. At St. Paul's they
are received by the Dean and Chapter at the West Gate, and at that
minute--bang, bong, bung--the Tower and Park guns salute them! Next day
is the turn of the Cherbourg cannon and mortars. These are the guns
we took. Look at them with their carving and flaunting emblems--their
lilies, and crowns, and mottoes! Here they are, the Teneraire, the
Malfaisant, the Vainqueur -LRB-the Vainqueur, indeed! a pretty vainqueur of
Britons!-RRB-, and ever so many more. How the people shout as the pieces
are trailed through the streets in procession! As for Hetty and Mrs.
Lambert, I believe they are of opinion that Harry took every one of the
guns himself, dragging them out of the batteries, and destroying the
artillerymen. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) has immensely risen in the general estimation in the
last few days. Madame de Bernstein has asked about him (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>). Lady Maria has
begged her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) dear cousin George to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>), and, if possible, give her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>)
news of his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) brother. George, who was quite the head of the family
a couple of months since, finds himself deposed, and of scarce any
account, in Miss Hetty's eyes at least. Your wit, and your learning, and
your tragedies, may be all very well; but what are these in comparison
to victories and brass cannon? George takes his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) deposition very meekly.
They are fifteen thousand Britons. Why should they not march and take
Paris itself? Nothing more probable, think some of the ladies. They
embrace; they congratulate each other; they are in a high state of
excitement. For once, they long that Sir Miles and Lady Warrington were
in town, so that they might pay her (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) ladyship a visit, and ask, <div class="bookquote">``What
do you say to your nephew now, pray? Has he (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) not taken twenty-one finest
brass cannon; flung a hundred and twenty iron guns into the water,
seized twenty-seven ships in the harbour, and destroyed the basin
and the two piers at the entrance?''  (<font color='red'><b>ladyship visit</b></font>)</div>As the whole town rejoices and
illuminates, so these worthy folks display brilliant red hangings in
their cheeks, and light up candles of joy in their eyes, in honour of
their champion and conqueror.

<p/>But now, I grieve to say, comes a cloudy day after the fair weather. The
appetite of our commanders, growing by what it fed on, led them to think
they had not feasted enough on the plunder of St. Malo; and thither,
after staying a brief time at Portsmouth and the Wight, the conquerors
of Cherbourg returned. They were landed in the Bay of St. Lunar, at
a distance of a few miles from the place, and marched towards it,
intending to destroy it this time. Meanwhile the harbour of St. Lunar
was found insecure, and the fleet moved up to St. Cas, keeping up its
communication with the invading army.

<p/>Now the British Lion found that the town of St. Malo--which he (<font color='blue'><b>Wight</b></font>) had
proposed to swallow at a single mouthful--was guarded by an army of
French, which the Governor of Brittany had brought to the succour of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Governor</b></font>) good town, and the meditated coup-de-main being thus impossible,
our leaders marched for their ships again, which lay duly awaiting our
warriors in the Bay of St. Cas.

<p/>Hide, blushing glory, hide St. Cas's day! As our troops were marching
down to their ships they became aware of an army following them, which
the French governor of the province had sent from Brest. Two-thirds
of the troops, and all the artillery, were already embarked, when the
Frenchmen came down upon the remainder. Four companies of the first
regiment of guards and the grenadier companies of the army, faced
about on the beach to await the enemy, whilst the remaining troops were
carried off in the boats. As the French descended from the heights round
the bay, these guards and grenadiers marched out to attack them, leaving
an excellent position which they had occupied--a great dyke raised on
the shore, and behind which they might have resisted to advantage. And
now, eleven hundred men were engaged with six--nay, ten times their
number; and, after a while, broke and made for the boats with a sauve
qui peut! Seven hundred out of the eleven were killed, drowned, or
taken prisoners--the General himself was killed--and, ah! where were the
volunteers?

<p/>A man of peace myself, and little intelligent of the practice or the
details of war, I own I think less of the engaged troops than of the
people they leave behind. Jack the Guardsman and La Tulipe of the Royal
Bretagne are face to face, and striving to knock each other's brains
out. Bon! It is their nature to--like the bears and lions--and we will
not say Heaven, but some power or other has made them so to do. But the
girl of Tower Hill, who hung on Jack's neck before he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) departed; and the
lass at Quimper, who gave the Frenchman his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) brule-gueule and tobacco-box
before he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) departed on the noir trajet? What have you done, poor little
tender hearts, that you should grieve so? My business is not with the
army, but with the people left behind. What a fine state Miss Hetty
Lambert must be in, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) hears of the disaster to the troops and the
slaughter of the grenadier companies! What grief and doubt are in George
Warrington's breast; what commiseration in Martin Lambert's, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) looks
into his (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) little girl's face and reads her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) piteous story there! Howe, the
brave Commodore, rowing in his (<font color='blue'><b>Howe</b></font>) barge under the enemy's fire, has rescued
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Howe</b></font>) boats scores and scores of our flying people. More are drowned;
hundreds are prisoners, or shot on the beach. Among these, where is our
Virginian?




<p/>CHAPTER LXV. Soldier's Return


<p/>Great Powers! will the vainglory of men, especially of Frenchmen, never
cease? Will it be believed, that after the action of St. Cas--a mere
affair of cutting off a rearguard, as you are aware--they were so
unfeeling as to fire away I don't know how much powder at the Invalides
at Paris, and brag and bluster over our misfortune? Is there any
magnanimity in hallooing and huzzaying because five or six hundred brave
fellows have been caught by ten thousand on a seashore, and that fate
has overtaken them which is said to befall the hindmost? I had a mind
to design an authentic picture of the rejoicings at London upon our
glorious success at St. Malo. I fancied the polished guns dragged in
procession by our gallant tars; the stout horse-grenadiers prancing by;
the mob waving hats, roaring cheers, picking pockets, and our friends in
a balcony in Fleet Street looking on and blessing this scene of British
triumph. But now that the French Invalides have been so vulgar as to
imitate the Tower, and set up their St. Cas against our St. Malo, I
scorn to allude to the stale subject. I say Nolo, not Malo: content, for
my part, if Harry has returned from one expedition and t'other with a
whole skin. And have I ever said he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was so much as bruised? Have I not,
for fear of exciting my fair young reader, said that he (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) was as well as
ever he (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) had been in his (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) life? The sea air had browned his (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) cheek, and
the ball whistling by his (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) side-curl had spared it. The ocean had wet his (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>)
gaiters and other garments, without swallowing up his (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) body. He (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) had, it
is true, shown the lapels of his (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) coat to the enemy; but for as short a
time as possible, withdrawing out of their sight as quick as might be.
And what, pray, are lapels but reverses? Coats have them, as well as
men; and our duty is to wear them with courage and good-humour.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can tell you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>said Harry, <div class="bookquote">``we all had to run for it; and when our
line broke, it was he (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) who could get to the boats who was most lucky. The
French horse and foot pursued us down to the sea, and were mingled
among us, cutting our men down, and bayoneting them on the ground. Poor
Armytage was shot in advance of me, and fell; and I took him (<font color='blue'><b>Armytage</b></font>) up and
staggered through the surf to a boat. It was lucky that the sailors in
our boat weren't afraid; for the shot were whistling about their ears,
breaking the blades of their oars, and riddling their flag with shot;
but the officer in command was as cool as if he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) had been drinking a bowl
of punch at Portsmouth, which we had one on landing, I can promise you.
Poor Sir John was less lucky than me. He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) never lived to reach the ship,
and the service has lost a fine soldier, and Miss Howe a true gentleman
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Howe</b></font>) husband. There must be these casualties, you see; and his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) brother
gets the promotion--the baronetcy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is of the poor lady I am thinking,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hetty/Miss Hetty/Lambert</b></font>)</div>says Miss Hetty -LRB-to whom haply
our volunteer is telling his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) story-RRB-; <div class="bookquote">``and the King. Why did the King
encourage Sir John Armytage to go? A gentleman could not refuse a
command from such a quarter. And now the poor gentleman is dead! Oh,
what a state his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) Majesty must be in!''

papa, wagging his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) head.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now you are laughing! Do you mean, sir, that when a gentleman dies

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The sauce-box would make a pretty little head for Temple Bar,''  (<font color='red'><b>the General</b></font>)</div>says the
General, who could see Miss Hetty's meaning behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) words, and was
aware in what a tumult of remorse, of consternation, of gratitude that
the danger was over, the little heart was beating. <div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>says he (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``my
dear. Were kings to weep for every soldier, what a life you would make

and, if Miss Hester Lambert got her (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) Pretender, I doubt whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) would
be any the happier. That family was never famous for too much feeling.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But if the King sent Harry--I mean Sir John Armytage--actually to
the war in which he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) lost his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) life, oughtn't his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) Majesty to repent very
much?''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>asks the young lady.

ashes after a victory?''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>asks George. <div class="bookquote">``I protest I don't want to thank

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes you do, George! Not that I have a right to speak, and you ain't
ever so much cleverer. But when your country wins you're glad--I know

though I done it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>says Harry. <div class="bookquote">``It don't seem to me right somehow that
Englishmen should have to do it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) added, gravely. And George smiled;
but did not choose to ask his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) brother what, on the other hand, was the
Frenchman's opinion.

<p/>```Tis a bad business,'' continued Harry, gravely; <div class="bookquote">``but `tis lucky `twas
no worse. The story about the French is, that their Governor, the Duke
of Aiguillon, was rather what you call a moistened chicken. Our whole
retreat might have been cut off, only, to be sure, we ourselves were in
a mighty hurry to move. The French local militia behaved famous, I am
happy to say; and there was ever so many gentlemen volunteers with `em,
who showed, as they ought to do, in the front. They say the Chevalier
of Tour d’Auvergne engaged in spite of the Duke of Aiguillon's orders.
Officers told us, who came off with a list of our prisoners and wounded
to General Bligh and Lord Howe. He (<font color='blue'><b>Howe</b></font>) is a lord now, since the news came of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Howe</b></font>) brother's death to home, George. He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) is a brave fellow, whether lord
or commoner.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) sister, who was to have married poor Sir John Armytage, think

sentimental.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And his (<font color='blue'><b>Armytage</b></font>) mother!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Lambert/Lambert</b></font>)</div>cries Mrs. Lambert. <div class="bookquote">``Have you seen her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) ladyship's

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How can sons help being brave who have been nursed by such a mother as

<p/>Hetty looks at him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), and thinks of him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) only as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was the other day,
tottering through the water towards the boats, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) comrade bleeding on
his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) shoulder, the enemy in pursuit, the shot flying round. And it was
she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) who drove him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) into the danger! Her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) words provoked him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) never
rebukes her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) now he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) is returned. Except when asked, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) scarcely speaks
about his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) adventures at all. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) is very grave and courteous with Hetty;
with the rest of the family especially frank and tender. But those
taunts of hers wounded him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Little hand!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) looks and demeanour seem
to say, <div class="bookquote">``thou shouldst not have been lifted against me! It is ill to
scorn any one, much more one who has been so devoted to you and all
yours. I may not be over quick of wit, but in as far as the heart goes,
I am the equal of the best, and the best of my heart your family has
had.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry's wrong, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) magnanimous endurance of it, served him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) to regain
in Miss Hetty's esteem that place which he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had lost during the previous
months' inglorious idleness. The respect which the fair pay to the brave
she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) was no longer pert in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) answers, or sarcastic in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
observations regarding his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) conduct. In a word, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) was a humiliated, an
altered, an improved Miss Hetty.

<p/>And all the world seemed to change towards Harry, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) towards the
world. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was no longer sulky and indolent: he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) no more desponded about
himself, or defied his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) neighbours. The colonel of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) regiment
reported his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) behaviour as exemplary, and recommended him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) for one of the
commissions vacated by the casualties during the expedition. Unlucky
as its termination was, it at least was fortunate to him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). His (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
brother-volunteers, when they came back to St. James's Street, reported
highly of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) behaviour. These volunteers and their actions were the
theme of everybody's praise. Had he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) been a general commanding, and slain
in the moment of victory, Sir John Armytage could scarce have had more
sympathy than that which the nation showed him (<font color='blue'><b>Armytage</b></font>). The papers teemed with
letters about him (<font color='blue'><b>Armytage</b></font>), and men of wit and sensibility vied with each other
in composing epitaphs in his (<font color='blue'><b>Armytage</b></font>) honour. The fate of his (<font color='blue'><b>Armytage</b></font>) affianced bride was
bewailed. She (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) was, as we have said, the sister of the brave Commodore
who had just returned from this unfortunate expedition, and succeeded
to the title of his (<font color='blue'><b>Commodore</b></font>) elder brother, an officer as gallant as himself, who
had just fallen in America.

<p/>My Lord Howe was heard to speak in special praise of Mr. Warrington, and
so he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) had a handsome share of the fashion and favour which the town
now bestowed on the volunteers. Doubtless there were thousands of
men employed who were as good as they but the English ever love their
gentlemen, and love that they should distinguish themselves; and these
volunteers were voted Paladins and heroes by common accord. As our young
noblemen will, they accepted their popularity very affably. White's and
Almack's illuminated when they returned, and St. James's embraced its
young knights. Harry was restored to full favour amongst them.
Their hands were held out eagerly to him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) again. Even his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) relations
congratulated him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>); and there came a letter from Castlewood, whither Aunt
Bernstein had by this time betaken herself, containing praises of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
valour, and a pretty little bank-bill, as a token of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) affectionate
aunt's approbation. This was under my Lord Castlewood's frank, who sent
his (<font color='blue'><b>Castlewood</b></font>) regards to both his (<font color='blue'><b>Castlewood</b></font>) kinsmen, and an offer of the hospitality of his (<font color='blue'><b>Castlewood</b></font>)
country-house, if they were minded to come to him (<font color='blue'><b>Castlewood</b></font>). And besides this,
there came to him (<font color='blue'><b>Castlewood</b></font>) a private letter through the post--not very well
spelt, but in a handwriting which Harry smiled to see again, in which
his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) affeetionate cousin, Maria Esmond, told him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) always loved to hear
his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) praises -LRB-which were in everybody's mouth now-RRB-, and sympathised in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) good or evil fortune; and that, whatever occurred to him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) begged
to keep a little place in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) heart. Parson Sampson, she (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) wrote, had
preached a beautiful sermon about the horrors of war, and the noble
actions of men who volunteered to face battle and danger in the service
of their country. Indeed, the chaplain wrote himself, presently, a
letter full of enthusiasm, in which he (<font color='blue'><b>chaplain</b></font>) saluted Mr. Harry as his (<font color='blue'><b>chaplain</b></font>) friend,
his (<font color='blue'><b>chaplain</b></font>) benefactor, his (<font color='blue'><b>chaplain</b></font>) glorious hero. Even Sir Miles Warrington despatched
a basket of game from Norfolk: and one bird -LRB-shot sitting-RRB-, with love
to my cousin, had a string and paper round the leg, and was sent as the
first victim of young Miles's fowling-piece.

<p/>And presently, with joy beaming in his (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) countenance, Mr. Lambert came
to visit his (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) young friends at their lodgings in Southampton Row, and
announced to them that Mr. Henry Warrington was forthwith to be gazetted
as Ensign in the Second Battalion of Kingsley's, the 20th Regiment,
which had been engaged in the campaign, and which now at this time was
formed into a separate regiment, the 67th. Its colonel was not with his (<font color='blue'><b>colonel</b></font>)
regiment during its expedition to Brittany. He (<font color='blue'><b>colonel</b></font>) was away at Cape Breton,
and was engaged in capturing those guns at Louisbourg, of which the
arrival in England had caused such exultation.




<p/>CHAPTER LXVI. In which we go a-courting


<p/>Some of my amiable readers no doubt are in the custom of visiting that
famous garden in the Regent's Park, in which so many of our finned,
feathered, four-footed fellow-creatures are accommodated with board and
lodging, in return for which they exhibit themselves for our instruction
and amusement: and there, as a man's business and private thoughts
follow him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) everywhere, and mix themselves with all life and nature round
about him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), I found myself, whilst looking at some fish in the aquarium,
still actually thinking of our friends the Virginians.

<p/>One of the most beautiful motion-masters I ever beheld, sweeping through
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) green bath in harmonious curves, now turning his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) black glistening
back to me, now exhibiting his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fair white chest, in every movement
active and graceful, turned out to be our old homely friend the
flounder, whom we have all gobbled up out of his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) bath of water souchy at
Greenwich, without having the slightest idea that he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) was a beauty.

<p/>As is the race of man, so is the race of flounders. If you can but see
the latter in his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) right element, you may view him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) agile, healthy, and
comely: put him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) out of his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) place, and behold his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) beauty is gone, his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)
motions are disgraceful: he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) flaps the unfeeling ground ridiculously
with his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) tail, and will presently gasp his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) feeble life out. Take him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)
up tenderly, ere it be too late, and cast him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) into his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) native Thames
again--But stop: I believe there is a certain proverb about fish out
of water, and that other profound naturalists have remarked on them
before me. Now Harry Warrington had been floundering for ever so long
a time past, and out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) proper element. As soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) found it,
health, strength, spirits, energy, returned to him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>), and with the tap of
the epaulet on his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) shoulder he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) sprang up an altered being. He (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) delighted
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) new profession; he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) engaged in all its details, and mastered them
with eager quickness. Had I the skill of my friend Lorrequer, I would
follow the other Harry into camp, and see him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) on the march, at the
mess, on the parade-ground; I would have many a carouse with him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
companions; I would cheerfully live with him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) under the tents; I would
knowingly explain all the manoeuvres of war, and all the details of the
life military. As it is, the reader must please, out of his (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) experience
and imagination, to fill in the colours of the picture of which I can
give but meagre hints and outlines, and, above all, fancy Mr. Harry
Warrington in his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) new red coat and yellow facings, very happy to bear
the King's colours, and pleased to learn and perform all the duties of
his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) new profession.

<p/>As each young man delighted in the excellence of the other, and
cordially recognised his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) brother's superior qualities, George, we may be
sure, was proud of Harry's success, and rejoiced in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) returning good
fortune. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wrote an affectionate letter to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) mother in Virginia,
recounting all the praises which he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had heard of Harry, and which his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
brother's modesty, George knew, would never allow him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) to repeat. He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
described how Harry had won his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) own first step in the army, and how
he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), George, would ask his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) mother leave to share with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) the expense of
purchasing a higher rank for him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>).

<p/>Nothing, said George, would give him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) a greater delight, than to be able
to help his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) brother, and the more so, as, by his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) sudden return into
life, as it were, he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) had deprived Harry of an inheritance which he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had
legitimately considered as his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) own. Labouring under that misconception,
Harry had indulged in greater expenses than he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) ever would have thought
of incurring as a younger brother; and George thought it was but fair,
and as it were, as a thank-offering for his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) own deliverance, that he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
should contribute liberally to any scheme for his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) brother's advantage.

<p/>And now, having concluded his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) statement respecting Harry's affairs,
George took occasion to speak of his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) own, and addressed his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) honoured
mother on a point which very deeply concerned himself. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was aware
that the best friends he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) brother had found in England were the
good Mr. and Mrs. Lambert, the latter Madam Esmond's schoolfellow of
earlier years. Where their own blood relations had been worldly and
unfeeling, these true friends had ever been generous and kind. The
General was respected by the whole army, and beloved by all who knew
him (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>). No mother's affection could have been more touching than Mrs.
Lambert's for both Madam Esmond's children; and now, wrote Mr. George,
he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) himself had formed an attachment for the elder Miss Lambert, on which
he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) thought the happiness of his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) life depended, and which he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) besought his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
honoured mother to approve. He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) had made no precise offers to the young
lady or her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) parents; but he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) was bound to say that he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) had made little
disguise of his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) sentiments, and that the young lady, as well as her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
parents, seemed favourable to him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had been so admirable and
exemplary a daughter to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) own mother, that he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) felt sure she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) would do
her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) duty by his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>). In a word, Mr. Warrington described the young lady as a
model of perfection, and expressed his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) firm belief that the happiness
or misery of his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) own future life depended upon possessing or losing her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>).
Why do you not produce this letter? haply asks some sentimental reader,
of the present Editor, who has said how he (<font color='blue'><b>Editor</b></font>) has the whole Warrington
correspondence in his (<font color='blue'><b>Editor</b></font>) hands. Why not? Because `tis cruel to babble the
secrets of a young man's love; to overhear his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) incoherent vows and
wild raptures, and to note, in cold blood, the secrets--it may be,
the follies--of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) passion. Shall we play eavesdropper at twilight
embrasures, count sighs and hand-shakes, bottle hot tears: lay our
stethoscope on delicate young breasts, and feel their heart-throbs? I
protest, for one, love is sacred. Wherever I see it -LRB-as one sometimes
may in this world-RRB- shooting suddenly out of two pair of eyes; or
glancing sadly even from one pair; or looking down from the mother to
the baby in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) lap; or from papa at his (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) girl's happiness as she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) is
whirling round the room with the captain; or from John Anderson, as his (<font color='blue'><b>Anderson</b></font>)
old wife comes into the room--the bonne vieille, the ever peerless among
women; wherever we see that signal, I say, let us salute it. It is not
only wrong to kiss and tell, but to tell about kisses. Everybody who
has been admitted to the mystery,--hush about it. Down with him (<font color='blue'><b>Anderson</b></font>) qui Deae
sacrum vulgarit arcanae. Beware how you dine with him (<font color='blue'><b>Anderson</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Anderson</b></font>) will print
your private talk: as sure as you sail with him (<font color='blue'><b>Anderson</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Anderson</b></font>) will throw you over.

<p/>Whilst Harry's love of battle has led him (<font color='blue'><b>Anderson</b></font>) to smell powder--to rush upon
reluctantes dracones, and to carry wounded comrades out of fire, George
has been pursuing an amusement much more peaceful and delightful to
him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>); penning sonnets to his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) mistress's eyebrow, mayhap; pacing in the
darkness under her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) window, and watching the little lamp which shone upon
her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) chamber; finding all sorts of pretexts for sending little
notes which don't seem to require little answers, but get them; culling
bits out of his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) favourite poets, and flowers out of Covent Garden
for somebody's special adornment and pleasure; walking to St. James's
Church, singing very likely out of the same Prayer-book, and never
hearing one word of the sermon, so much do other thoughts engross him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>);
being prodigiously affectionate to all Miss Theo's relations--to her (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>)
little brother and sister at school; to the elder at college; to Miss
Hetty, with whom he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) engages in gay passages of wit; and to mamma, who is
half in love with him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) herself, Martin Lambert says; for if fathers are
sometimes sulky at the appearance of the destined son-in-law, is it not
a fact that mothers become sentimental and, as it were, love their own
loves over again?

<p/>Gumbo and Sady are for ever on the trot between Southampton Row and
Dean Street. In the summer months all sorts of junketings and
pleasure-parties are devised; and there are countless proposals to go
to Ranelagh, to Hampstead, to Vauxhall, to Marylebone Gardens, and what
not. George wants the famous tragedy copied out fair for the stage, and
who can write such a beautiful Italian hand as Miss Theo? As the sheets
pass to and fro they are accompanied by little notes of thanks, of
interrogation, of admiration, always. See, here is the packet, marked
in Warrington's neat hand, <div class="bookquote">``T's letters, 1758-9.''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>Shall we open them and
reveal their tender secrets to the public gaze? Those virgin words were
whispered for one ear alone. Years after they were written, the
husband read, no doubt, with sweet pangs of remembrance, the fond lines
addressed to the lover. It were a sacrilege to show the pair to public
eyes: only let kind readers be pleased to take our word that the young
lady's letters are modest and pure, the gentleman's most respectful and
tender. In fine, you see, we have said very little about it; but, in
these few last months, Mr. George Warrington has made up his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) mind that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) has found the woman of women. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) mayn't be the most beautiful. Why,
there is Cousin Flora, there is Coelia, and Ardelia, and a hundred
more, who are ever so much more handsome: but her (<font color='blue'><b>Flora</b></font>) sweet face pleases him (<font color='blue'><b>Cousin</b></font>)
better than any other in the world. She (<font color='blue'><b>Flora</b></font>) mayn't be the most clever, but
her (<font color='blue'><b>Flora</b></font>) voice is the dearest and pleasantest to hear; and in her (<font color='blue'><b>Flora</b></font>) company he (<font color='blue'><b>Cousin</b></font>)
is so clever himself; he (<font color='blue'><b>Cousin</b></font>) has such fine thoughts; he (<font color='blue'><b>Cousin</b></font>) uses such eloquent
words; he (<font color='blue'><b>Cousin</b></font>) is so generous, noble, witty, that no wonder he (<font color='blue'><b>Cousin</b></font>) delights in
it. And, in regard to the young lady,--as thank Heaven I never thought
so ill of women as to suppose them to be just, we may be sure that there
is no amount of wit, of wisdom, of beauty, of valour, of virtue with
which she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) does not endow her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) young hero.

<p/>When George's letter reached home, we may fancy that it created no small
excitement in the little circle round Madam Esmond's fireside. So he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) was
in love, and wished to marry! It was but natural, and would keep him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
out of harm's way. If he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) proposed to unite himself with a well-bred
Christian young woman, Madam saw no harm.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I knew they would be setting their caps at him (<font color='blue'><b>Howe</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>says Mountain. <div class="bookquote">``They
fancy that his (<font color='blue'><b>Howe</b></font>) wealth is as great as his (<font color='blue'><b>Howe</b></font>) estate. He (<font color='blue'><b>Howe</b></font>) does not say whether
the young lady has money. I fear otherwise.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``People would set their caps at him (<font color='blue'><b>Howe</b></font>) here, I dare say,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madam Esmond/Madam Esmond Warrington/Madam Warrington</b></font>)</div>says Madam
Esmond, grimly looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) dependant, <div class="bookquote">``and try and catch Mr. Esmond
Warrington for their own daughters, who are no richer than Miss Lambert
may be.''

 (<font color='red'><b>dependant</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose your ladyship means me!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>says Mountain. <div class="bookquote">``My Fanny is poor, as
you say; and `tis kind of you to remind me of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) poverty!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I said people would set their caps at him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>). If the cap fits you, tant
pis! as my papa used to say.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You think, madam, I am scheming to keep George for my daughter? I thank
you, on my word! A good opinion you seem to have of us after the years
we have lived together!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear Mountain, I know you much better than to suppose you could ever
fancy your daughter would be a suitable match for a gentleman of Mr.
Esmond's rank and station,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>says Madam, with much dignity.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Fanny Parker was as good as Molly Benson at school, and Mr. Mountain's
daughter is as good as Mr. Lambert's!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Mountain cries out.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then you did think of marrying her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) to my son! I shall write to
Mr. Esmond Warrington, and say how sorry I am that you should be
disappointed!''  (<font color='red'><b>the mistress</b></font>)</div>says the mistress of Castlewood. And we, for our parts,
may suppose that Mrs. Mountain was disappointed, and had some ambitious
views respecting her (<font color='blue'><b>Mountain</b></font>) daughter--else, why should she (<font color='blue'><b>Mountain</b></font>) have been so angry
at the notion of Mr. Warrington's marriage?

<p/>In reply to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mountain</b></font>) son, Madam Esmond wrote back that she (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) was pleased with
the fraternal love George exhibited; that it was indeed but right in
some measure to compensate Harry, whose expectations had led him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) to
adopt a more costly mode of life than he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) would have entered on had he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
known he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was only a younger son. And with respect to purchasing his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
promotion, she (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) would gladly halve the expense with Harry's elder
brother, being thankful to think his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) own gallantry had won him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) first
step. This bestowal of George's money, Madam Esmond added, was at least
much more satisfactory than some other extravagances to which she (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) would
not advert.

<p/>The other extravagance to which Madam alluded was the payment of the
ransom to the French captain's family, to which tax George's mother
never would choose to submit. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had a determined spirit of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) own,
which her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) son inherited. His (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) persistence she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) called pride and obstinacy.
What she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) thought of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) own pertinacity, her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) biographer, who lives so
far from her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) time, does not pretend to say. Only I dare say people
a hundred years ago pretty much resembled their grandchildren of the
present date, and loved to have their own way, and to make others follow
it.

<p/>Now, after paying his (<font color='blue'><b>biographer</b></font>) own ransom, his (<font color='blue'><b>biographer</b></font>) brother's debts, and half the
price for his (<font color='blue'><b>biographer</b></font>) promotion, George calculated that no inconsiderable
portion of his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) private patrimony would be swallowed up: nevertheless
he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) made the sacrifice with a perfect good heart. His (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) good mother always
enjoined him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) letters to remember who his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) grandfather was, and
to support the dignity of his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) family accordingly. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) gave him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) various
commissions to purchase goods in England, and though she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) as yet had sent
him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) very trifling remittances, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) alluded so constantly to the exalted
rank of the Esmonds, to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) desire that he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) should do nothing unworthy of
that illustrious family; she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) advised him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) so peremptorily and frequently
to appear in the first society of the country, to frequent the court
where his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) ancestors had been accustomed to move, and to appear always in
the world in a manner worthy of his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) name, that George made no doubt
his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) mother's money would be forthcoming when his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) own ran short, and
generously obeyed her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) injunctions as to his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) style of life. I find in the
Esmond papers of this period, bills for genteel entertainments, tailors'
bills for court suits supplied, and liveries for his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) honour's negro
servants and chairmen, horse-dealers' receipts, and so forth; and am
thus led to believe that the elder of our Virginians was also after a
while living at a considerable expense.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) was not wild or extravagant like his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) brother. There was no talk of
gambling or racehorses against Mr. George; his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) table was liberal, his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
equipages handsome, his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) purse always full, the estate to which he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) was
heir was known to be immense. I mention these circumstances because they
may probably have influenced the conduct both of George and his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) friends
in that very matter concerning which, as I have said, he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) mother
had been just corresponding. The young heir of Virginia was travelling
for his (<font color='blue'><b>heir</b></font>) pleasure and improvement in foreign kingdoms. The queen, his (<font color='blue'><b>heir</b></font>)
mother, was in daily correspondence with his (<font color='blue'><b>heir</b></font>) Highness, and constantly
enjoined him (<font color='blue'><b>heir</b></font>) to act as became his (<font color='blue'><b>heir</b></font>) lofty station. There could be no
doubt from her (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) letters that she (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) desired he (<font color='blue'><b>heir</b></font>) should live liberally and
magnificently. He (<font color='blue'><b>heir</b></font>) was perpetually making purchases at his (<font color='blue'><b>heir</b></font>) parent's
order. She (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) had not settled as yet; on the contrary, she (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) had wrote out by
the last mail for twelve new sets of waggon harness, and an organ
that should play fourteen specified psalm-tunes: which articles George
dutifully ordered. She (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) had not paid as yet, and might not to-day or
to-morrow, but eventually, of course, she (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) would: and Mr. Warrington
never thought of troubling his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) friends about these calculations, or
discussing with them his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) mother's domestic affairs. They, on their side,
took for granted that he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) was in a state of competence and ease, and,
without being mercenary folks, Mr. and Mrs. Lambert were no doubt
pleased to see an attachment growing up between their daughter and
a young gentleman of such good principles, talents, family, and
expectations. There was honesty in all Mr. Esmond Warrington's words
and actions, and in his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) behaviour to the world a certain grandeur and
simplicity, which showed him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) to be a true gentleman. Somewhat cold and
haughty in his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) demeanour to strangers, especially towards the great, he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>)
was not in the least supercilious: he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) was perfectly courteous towards
women, and with those people whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) loved, especially kind, amiable,
lively, and tender.

<p/>No wonder that one young woman we know of got to think him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) the best man
in all the world--alas! not even excepting papa. A great love felt by
a man towards a woman makes him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) better, as regards her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), than all other
men. We have said that George used to wonder himself when he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) found how
witty, how eloquent, how wise he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) was, when he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) talked with the fair young
creature whose heart had become all his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)... I say we will not again
listen to their love whispers. Those soft words do not bear being
written down. If you please--good sir, or madam, who are sentimentally
inclined--lay down the book and think over certain things for yourself.
You may be ever so old now; but you remember. It may be all dead and
buried; but in a moment, up it springs out of its grave, and looks, and
smiles, and whispers as of yore when it clung to your arm, and dropped
fresh tears on your heart. It is here, and alive, did I say? O far, far
away! O lonely hearth and cold ashes! Here is the vase, but the roses
are gone; here is the shore, and yonder the ship was moored; but the
anchors are up, and it has sailed away for ever.

<p/>Et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. This, however, is mere sentimentality;
and as regards George and Theo, is neither here nor there. What I mean
to say is, that the young lady's family were perfectly satisfied with
the state of affairs between her (<font color='blue'><b>family</b></font>) and Mr. Warrington; and though he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) had
not as yet asked the decisive question, everybody else knew what the
answer would be when it came.

<p/>Mamma perhaps thought the question was a long time coming.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Psha! my dear!''  (<font color='red'><b>the General</b></font>)</div>says the General. <div class="bookquote">``There is time enough in all
conscience. Theo is not much more than seventeen; George, if I mistake
not, is under forty; and, besides, he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) must have time to write to
Virginia, and ask mamma.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But suppose she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) refuses?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That will be a bad day for old and young,''  (<font color='red'><b>the General</b></font>)</div>says the General, <div class="bookquote">``Let us
rather say, suppose she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) consents, my love?--I can't fancy anybody in the
world refusing Theo anything she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) has set her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) heart on,''  (<font color='red'><b>the General</b></font>)</div>adds the father:
<div class="bookquote">``and I am sure `tis bent upon this match.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the father</b></font>)</div><p/>So they all waited with the utmost anxiety until an answer from Madam
Esmond should arrive; and trembled lest the French privateers should
take the packet-ship by which the precious letter was conveyed.




<p/>CHAPTER LXVII. In which a Tragedy is acted, and two more are begun


<p/>James Wolfe, Harry's new Colonel, came back from America a few weeks
after our Virginian had joined his (<font color='blue'><b>Virginian</b></font>) regiment. Wolfe had previously been
Lieutenant-Colonel of Kingsley's, and a second battalion of the regiment
had been formed and given to him (<font color='blue'><b>Wolfe</b></font>) in reward for his (<font color='blue'><b>Wolfe</b></font>) distinguished
gallantry and services at Cape Breton. Harry went with quite unfeigned
respect and cordiality to pay his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) duty to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) new commander, on whom the
eyes of the world began to be turned now,--the common opinion being that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was likely to become a great general. In the late affairs in France,
several officers of great previous repute had been tried and found
lamentably wanting. The Duke of Marlborough had shown himself no worthy
descendant of his (<font color='blue'><b>descendant</b></font>) great ancestor. About my Lord George Sackville's
military genius there were doubts, even before his (<font color='blue'><b>descendant</b></font>) unhappy behaviour at
Minden prevented a great victory. The nation was longing for military
glory, and the Minister was anxious to find a general who might gratify
the eager desire of the people. Mr. Wolfe's and Mr. Lambert's business
keeping them both in London, the friendly intercourse between those
officers was renewed, no one being more delighted than Lambert at his (<font color='blue'><b>Wolfe</b></font>)
younger friend's good fortune.

<p/>Harry, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was away from his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) duty, was never tired of hearing Mr.
Wolfe's details of the military operations of the last year, about which
Wolfe talked very freely and openly. Whatever thought was in his (<font color='blue'><b>Wolfe</b></font>)
mind, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wolfe</b></font>) appears to have spoken it out generously. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wolfe</b></font>) had that heroic
simplicity which distinguished Nelson afterwards: he (<font color='blue'><b>Wolfe</b></font>) talked frankly of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Wolfe</b></font>) actions. Some of the fine gentlemen at St. James's might wonder and
sneer at him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>); but amongst our little circle of friends we may be sure he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>)
found admiring listeners. The young General had the romance of a boy on
many matters. He (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) delighted in music and poetry. On the last day of his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>)
life he (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) would rather have written Gray's Elegy than have won a
battle. We may be sure that with a gentleman of such literary tastes our
friend George would become familiar; and as they were both in love, and
both accepted lovers, and both eager for happiness, no doubt they must
have had many sentimental conversations together which would be very
interesting to report could we only have accurate accounts of them. In
one of his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) later letters, Warrington writes:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I had the honour of knowing the famous General Wolfe, and seeing much
of him (<font color='blue'><b>Wolfe</b></font>) during his (<font color='blue'><b>Wolfe</b></font>) last stay in London. We had a subject of conversation
then which was of unfailing interest to both of us, and I could not but
admire Mr. Wolfe's simplicity, his (<font color='blue'><b>Wolfe</b></font>) frankness, and a sort of glorious
bravery which characterised him (<font color='blue'><b>Wolfe</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Wolfe</b></font>) was much in love, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Wolfe</b></font>) wanted
heaps and heaps of laurels to take to his (<font color='blue'><b>Wolfe</b></font>) mistress. `If it be a sin to
covet honour,' he (<font color='blue'><b>Wolfe</b></font>) used to say with Harry the Fifth -LRB-he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was passionately
fond of plays and poetry-RRB-, `I am the most offending soul alive.' Surely
on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) last day he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had a feast which was enough to satisfy the greediest
appetite for glory. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hungered after it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) seemed to me not merely
like a soldier going resolutely to do his (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) duty, but rather like a knight
in quest of dragons and giants. My own country has furnished of late a
chief of a very different order, and quite an opposite genius. I scarce
know which to admire most. The Briton's chivalrous ardour, or the more
than Roman constancy of our great Virginian.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div><p/>As Mr. Lambert's official duties detained him (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) in London, his (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) family
remained contentedly with him (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>), and I suppose Mr. Warrington was so
satisfied with the rural quiet of Southampton Row and the beautiful
flowers and trees of Bedford Gardens, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) did not care to quit
London for any long period. He (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) made his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) pilgrimage to Castlewood, and
passed a few days there, occupying the chamber of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) had often
heard his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) grandfather talk, and which Colonel Esmond had occupied as a
boy and he (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) was received kindly enough by such members of the family as
happened to be at home. But no doubt he (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) loved better to be in London by
the side of a young person in whose society he (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) found greater pleasure
than any which my Lord Castlewood's circle could afford him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>), though all
the ladies were civil, and Lady Maria especially gracious, and enchanted
with the tragedy which George and Parson Sampson read out to the ladies.
The chaplain was enthusiastic in its praises, and indeed it was
through his (<font color='blue'><b>chaplain</b></font>) interest and not through Mr. Johnson's after all, that Mr.
Warrington's piece ever came on the stage. Mr. Johnson, it is true,
pressed the play on his (<font color='blue'><b>Johnson</b></font>) friend Mr. Garrick for Drury Lane, but Garrick
had just made an arrangement with the famous Mr. Home for a tragedy from
the pen of the author of Douglas. Accordingly, Carpezan was carried to
Mr. Rich at Covent Garden, and accepted by that manager.

<p/>On the night of the production of the piece, Mr. Warrington gave an
elegant entertainment to his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) friends at the Bedford Head, in Covent
Garden, whence they adjourned in a body to the theatre; leaving only one
or two with our young author, who remained at the coffee-house,
where friends from time to time came to him (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) with an account of the
performance. The part of Carpezan was filled by Barry, Shuter was the
old nobleman, Reddish, I need scarcely say, made an excellent Ulric, and
the King of Bohemia was by a young actor from Dublin, Mr. Geoghegan, or
Hagan as he (<font color='blue'><b>Hagan</b></font>) was called on the stage, and who looked and performed the
part to admiration. Mrs. Woffington looked too old in the first act as
the heroine, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Woffington</b></font>) murder in the fourth act, about which great doubts
were expressed, went off to the terror and delight of the audience. Miss
Wayn sang the ballad which is supposed to be sung by the king's page,
just at the moment of the unhappy wife's execution, and all agreed that
Barry was very terrible and pathetic as Carpezan, especially in the
execution scene. The grace and elegance of the young actor, Hagan, won
general applause. The piece was put very elegantly on the stage by Mr.
Rich, though there was some doubt whether, in the march of Janissaries
in the last, the manager was correct in introducing a favourite
elephant, which had figured in various pantomimes, and by which one of
Mr. Warrington's black servants marched in a Turkish habit. The other
sate in the footman's gallery, and uproariously wept and applauded at
the proper intervals.

<p/>The execution of Sybilla was the turning-point of the piece. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Janissaries</b></font>) head
off, George's friends breathed freely, and one messenger after another
came to him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) at the coffee-house, to announce the complete success of
the tragedy. Mr. Barry, amidst general applause, announced the play for
repetition, and that it was the work of a young gentleman of Virginia,
his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) first attempt in the dramatic style.

<p/>We should like to have been in the box where all our friends were seated
during the performance, to have watched Theo's flutter and anxiety
whilst the success of the play seemed dubious, and have beheld the
blushes and the sparkles in her (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) eyes, when the victory was assured.
Harry, during the little trouble in the fourth act, was deadly
pale--whiter, Mrs. Lambert said, than Barry, with all his (<font color='blue'><b>Barry</b></font>) chalk. But
if Briareus could have clapped hands, he (<font color='blue'><b>Barry</b></font>) could scarcely have made more
noise than Harry at the end of the piece. Mr. Wolfe and General Lambert
huzzayed enthusiastically. Mrs. Lambert, of course, cried: and though
Hetty said, <div class="bookquote">``Why do you cry, mamma? I you don't want any of them alive
again; you know it serves them all right'' (<font color='red'><b>Hetty/Miss Hetty/Lambert</b></font>)</div>--the girl was really as much
delighted as any person present, including little Charley from the
Chartreux, who had leave from Dr. Crusius for that evening, and Miss
Lucy, who had been brought from boarding-school on purpose to be present
on the great occasion. My Lord Castlewood and his (<font color='blue'><b>Castlewood</b></font>) sister, Lady Maria,
were present; and his (<font color='blue'><b>Castlewood</b></font>) lordship went from his (<font color='blue'><b>Castlewood</b></font>) box and complimented
Mr. Barry and the other actors on the stage; and Parson Sampson was
invaluable in the pit, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) led the applause, having, I believe,
given previous instructions to Gumbo to keep an eye upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) from the
gallery, and do as he (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) did.

<p/>Be sure there was a very jolly supper of Mr. Warrington's friends that
night--much more jolly than Mr. Garrick's, for example, who made but a
very poor success with his (<font color='blue'><b>Garrick</b></font>) Agis and its dreary choruses, and who must
have again felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Garrick</b></font>) had missed a good chance, in preferring Mr.
Home's tragedy to our young author's. A jolly supper, did we say?--Many
jolly suppers. Mr. Gumbo gave an entertainment to several gentlemen
of the shoulder-knot, who had concurred in supporting his (<font color='blue'><b>Gumbo</b></font>) master's
masterpiece: Mr. Henry Warrington gave a supper at the Star and Garter,
in Pall Mall, to ten officers of his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) new regiment, who had come up for
the express purpose of backing Carpezan; and finally, Mr. Warrington
received the three principal actors of the tragedy, our family party
from the side box, Mr. Johnson and his (<font color='blue'><b>Johnson</b></font>) ingenious friend, Mr. Reynolds
the painter, my Lord Castlewood and his (<font color='blue'><b>Castlewood</b></font>) sister, and one or two more. My
Lady Maria happened to sit next to the young actor who had performed the
part of the King. Mr. Warrington somehow had Miss Theo for a neighbour,
and no doubt passed a pleasant evening beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>). The greatest
animation and cordiality prevailed, and when toasts were called, Lady
Maria gaily gave <div class="bookquote">``The King of Hungary''  (<font color='red'><b>Maria/Lady Maria/Lady Maria Esmond</b></font>)</div>for hers. That gentleman, who had
plenty of eloquence and fire, and excellent manners, on as well as off
the stage, protested that he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had already suffered death in the course of
the evening, hoped that he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) should die a hundred times more on the same
field; but, dead or living, vowed he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) knew whose humble servant he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) ever
should be. Ah, if he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had but a real crown in place of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) diadem of
pasteboard and tinsel, with what joy would he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) lay it at her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) ladyship's
feet! Neither my lord nor Mr. Esmond were over well pleased with the
gentleman's exceeding gallantry--a part of which they attributed, no
doubt justly, to the wine and punch, of which he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had been partaking very
freely. Theo and her (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) sister, who were quite new to the world, were a
little frightened by the exceeding energy of Mr. Hagan's manner--but
Lady Maria, much more experienced, took it in perfectly good part. At
a late hour coaches were called, to which the gentlemen attended the
ladies, after whose departure some of them returned to the supper-room,
and the end was that Carpezan had to be carried away in a chair, and
that the King of Hungary had a severe headache; and that the Poet,
though he (<font color='blue'><b>Poet</b></font>) remembered making a great number of speeches, was quite
astounded when half a dozen of his (<font color='blue'><b>Poet</b></font>) guests appeared at his (<font color='blue'><b>Poet</b></font>) house the next
day, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Poet</b></font>) had invited overnight to come and sup with him (<font color='blue'><b>Poet</b></font>) once more.

<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Poet</b></font>) put Mrs. Lambert and her (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) daughters into their coach on the night
previous, all the ladies were flurried, delighted, excited; and you may
be sure our gentleman was with them the next day, to talk of the play
and the audience, and the actors, and the beauties of the piece, over
and over again. Mrs. Lambert had heard that the ladies of the theatre
were dangerous company for young men. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) hoped George would have a
care, and not frequent the greenroom too much.

<p/>George smiled, and said he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) had a preventive against all greenroom
temptations, of which he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) was not in the least afraid; and as he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) spoke he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
looked in Theo's face, as if in those eyes lay the amulet which was to
preserve him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) from all danger.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why should he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) be afraid, mamma?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>asks the maiden simply. She (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) had no
idea of danger or of guile.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, my darling, I don't think he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) need be afraid,''  (<font color='red'><b>the mother</b></font>)</div>says the mother,
kissing her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't suppose Mr. George would fall in love with that painted old
creature who performed the chief part?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hetty/Miss Hetty/Lambert</b></font>)</div>asks Miss Hetty, with a toss of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>mamma</b></font>) must be old enough to be his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) mother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pray, do you suppose that at our age nobody can care for us, or that we
have no hearts left?''  (<font color='red'><b>mamma</b></font>)</div>asks mamma, very tartly. <div class="bookquote">``I believe, or I may
say, I hope and trust, your father thinks otherwise. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) is, I imagine,
perfectly satisfied, miss. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) does not sneer at age, whatever little
girls out of the schoolroom may do. And they had much better be back
there, and they had much better remember what the fifth commandment
is--that they had, Hetty!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I didn't think I was breaking it by saying that an actress was as old
as George's mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hetty/Miss Hetty/Lambert</b></font>)</div>pleaded Hetty.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``George's mother is as old as I am, miss!--at least she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was when we were
at school. And Fanny Parker--Mrs. Mountain who now is--was seven months
older, and we were in the French class together; and I have no idea
that our age is to be made the subject of remarks and ridicule by
our children, and I will thank you to spare it, if you please! Do you
consider your mother too old, George?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am glad my mother is of your age, Aunt Lambert,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>says George, in the
most sentimental manner.

<p/>Strange infatuation of passion--singular perversity of reason! At some
period before his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) marriage, it not unfrequently happens that a man
actually is fond of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mother-in-law! At this time our good General
vowed, and with some reason, that he (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) was jealous. Mrs. Lambert made much
more of George than of any other person in the family. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) dressed up
Theo to the utmost advantage in order to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) was for ever
caressing her (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>), and appealing to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) spoke. It was, <div class="bookquote">``Don't
you think he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) looks well?'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--<div class="bookquote">``Don't you think he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) looks pale, Theo,
to-day?'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--<div class="bookquote">``Don't you think he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) has been sitting up over his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) books too
much at night?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>and so forth. If he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) had a cold, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) would have liked to
make gruel for him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) and see his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) feet in hot water. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) sent him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) recipes
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) own for his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) health. When he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) was away, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) never ceased talking
about him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) daughter. I dare say Miss Theo liked the subject well
enough. When he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) came, she (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) was sure to be wanted in some other part of
the house, and would bid Theo take care of him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) till she (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) returned. Why,
before she (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) returned to the room, could you hear her (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) talking outside the
door to her (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) youngest innocent children, to her (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) servants in the upper
regions, and so forth? When she (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) reappeared, was not Mr. George always
standing or sitting at a considerable distance from Miss Theo--except,
to be sure, on that one day when she (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) had just happened to drop her (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>)
scissors, and he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) had naturally stooped down to pick them up? Why was she (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>)
blushing? Were not youthful cheeks made to blush, and roses to bloom in
the spring? Not that mamma ever noted the blushes, but began quite an
artless conversation about this or that, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) sate down brimful of
happiness to her (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) worktable.

<p/>And at last there came a letter from Virginia in Madam Esmond's neat,
well-known hand, and over which George trembled and blushed before he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
broke the seal. It was in answer to the letter which he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) had sent home,
respecting his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) brother's commission and his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) own attachment to Miss
Lambert. Of his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) intentions respecting Harry, Madam Esmond fully
approved. As for his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) marriage, she (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) was not against early marriages. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>)
would take his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) picture of Miss Lambert with the allowance that was to be
made for lovers' portraits, and hope, for his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) sake, that the young lady
was all he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) described her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) to be. With money, as Madam Esmond gathered
from her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) son's letter, she (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) did not appear to be provided at all, which
was a pity, as, though wealthy in land, their family had but little
ready-money. However, by Heaven's blessing, there was plenty at home for
children and children's children, and the wives of her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) sons should share
all she (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) had. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) heard more at length from Mr. and Mrs. Lambert,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) would reply for her (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) part more fully. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) did not pretend to say that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) had not greater hopes for her (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) son, as a gentleman of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) name and
prospects might pretend to the hand of the first lady of the land; but
as Heaven had willed that her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) son's choice should fall upon her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) old
friend's daughter, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) acquiesced, and would welcome George's wife as
her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) own child. This letter was brought by Mr. Van den Bosch of Albany,
who had lately bought a very large estate in Virginia, and who was bound
for England to put his (<font color='blue'><b>Bosch</b></font>) granddaughter to a boarding-school. She (<font color='blue'><b>granddaughter</b></font>), Madam
Esmond, was not mercenary, nor was it because this young lady was
heiress of a very great fortune that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) desired her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) sons to pay Mr. Van
d. B. every attention. Their properties lay close together, and could
Harry find in the young lady those qualities of person and mind suitable
for a companion for life, at least she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) would have the satisfaction of
seeing both her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) children near her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) declining years. Madam Esmond
concluded by sending her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) affectionate compliments to Mrs. Lambert, from
whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) begged to hear further, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) blessing to the young lady who
was to be her (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) daughter-in-law.

<p/>The letter was not cordial, and the writer evidently but half satisfied;
but, such as it was, her (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) consent was here formally announced. How
eagerly George ran away to Soho with the long-desired news in his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
pocket! I suppose our worthy friends there must have read his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) news in
his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) countenance--else why should Mrs. Lambert take her (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) daughter's hand
and kiss her (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) with such uncommon warmth, when George announced that
he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) had received letters from home? Then, with a break in his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) voice, a
pallid face, and a considerable tremor, turning to Mr. Lambert, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) said:
<div class="bookquote">``Madam Esmond's letter, sir, is in reply to one of mine, in which I
acquainted her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) that I had formed an attachment in England, for which I
asked my mother's approval. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) gives her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) consent, I am grateful to say,
and I have to pray my dear friends to be equally kind to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``God bless thee, my dear boy!''  (<font color='red'><b>the General</b></font>)</div>says the good General, laying a hand on
the young man's head. <div class="bookquote">``I am glad to have thee for a son, George. There,
there, don't go down on your knees, young folks! George may, to be sure,
and thank God for giving him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) the best little wife in all England. Yes,
my dear, except when you were ill, you never caused me a heartache--and
happy is the man, I say, who wins thee!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I have no doubt the young people knelt before their parents, as was the
fashion in those days; and am perfectly certain that Mrs. Lambert kissed
both of them, and likewise bedewed her (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) pocket-handkerchief in the most
plentiful manner. Hetty was not present at this sentimental scene, and
when she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) heard of it, spoke with considerable asperity, and a laugh that
was by no means pleasant, saying: <div class="bookquote">``Is this all the news you have to give
me? Why, I have known it these months past. Do you think I have no eyes
to see, and no ears to hear, indeed?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>But in private she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) was much
more gentle. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) flung herself on her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) sister's neck, embracing her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
passionately, and vowing that never, never would Theo find any one to
love her (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) like her (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) sister. With Theo she (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) became entirely mild and humble.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) could not abstain from her (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) jokes and satire with George, but he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) was
too happy to heed her (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) much, and too generous not to see the cause of her (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>)
jealousy.

<p/>When all parties concerned came to read Madam Esmond's letter, that
document, it is true, appeared rather vague. It contained only a promise
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) would receive the young people at her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) house, and no sort
of proposal for a settlement. The General shook his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) head over the
letter--he (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) did not think of examining it until some days after the
engagement had been made between George and his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) daughter: but now he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
read Madam Esmond's words, they gave him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) but small encouragement.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Bah!''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>says George. <div class="bookquote">``I shall have three hundred pounds for my tragedy. I
can easily write a play a year; and if the worst comes to the worst, we
can live on that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``On that and your patrimony,''  (<font color='red'><b>Theo/Lady Theo</b></font>)</div>says Theo's father.

<p/>George now had to explain, with some hesitation, that what with paying
bills for his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) mother, and Harry's commission and debts, and his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) own
ransom--George's patrimony proper was well-nigh spent.

<p/>Mr. Lambert's countenance looked graver still at this announcement, but
he (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) saw his (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) girl's eyes turned towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) with an alarm so tender, that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) took her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) arms and vowed that, let the worst come to the worst,
his (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) darling should not be balked of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) wish.

<p/>About the going back to Virginia, George frankly owned that he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) little
liked the notion of returning to be entirely dependent on his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) mother.
He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) gave General Lambert an idea of his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) life at home, and explained how
little to his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) taste that slavery was. No. Why should he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) not stay in
England, write more tragedies, study for the bar, get a place, perhaps?
Why, indeed? He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) straightway began to form a plan for another tragedy.
He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) brought portions of his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) work, from time to time, to Miss Theo and her (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>)
sister: Hetty yawned over the work, but Theo pronounced it to be still
more beautiful and admirable than the last, which was perfect.

<p/>The engagement of our young friends was made known to the members of
their respective families, and announced to Sir Miles Warrington, in
a ceremonious letter from his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) nephew. For a while Sir Miles saw no
particular objection to the marriage; though, to be sure, considering
his (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) name and prospects, Mr. Warrington might have looked higher. The
truth was, that Sir Miles imagined that Madam Esmond had made some
considerable settlement on her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) son, and that his (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) circumstances were more
than easy. But when he (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) heard that George was entirely dependent on his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
mother, and that his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) own small patrimony was dissipated, as Harry's had
been before, Sir Miles's indignation at his (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) nephew's imprudence knew no
bounds; he (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) could not find words to express his (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) horror and anger at the
want of principle exhibited by both these unhappy young men: he (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) thought
it his (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) duty to speak his (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) mind about them, and wrote his (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) opinion to his (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>)
sister Esmond in Virginia. As for General and Mrs. Lambert, who passed
for respectable persons, was it to be borne that such people should
inveigle a penniless young man into a marriage with their penniless
daughter? Regarding them, and George's behaviour, Sir Miles fully
explained his (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) views to Madam Esmond, gave half a finger to George
whenever his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) nephew called on him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) in town, and did not even invite him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
to partake of the famous family small-beer. Towards Harry his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) uncle
somewhat unbent; Harry had done his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) duty in the campaign, and was
mentioned with praise in high quarters. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had sown his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wild oats,--he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
at least was endeavouring to amend; but George was a young prodigal,
fast careering to ruin, and his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) name was only mentioned in the family
with a groan. Are there any poor fellows nowadays, I wonder, whose
polite families fall on them and persecute them; groan over them
and stone them, and hand stones to their neighbours that they may do
likewise? All the patrimony spent! Gracious heavens! Sir Miles turned
pale when he (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) saw his (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) nephew coming. Lady Warrington prayed for him (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) as a
dangerous reprobate; and, in the meantime, George was walking the town,
quite unconscious that he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) was occasioning so much wrath and so much
devotion. He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) took little Miley to the play and brought him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) back again.
He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) sent tickets to his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) aunt and cousins which they could not refuse, you
know; it would look too marked were they to break altogether. So they
not only took the tickets, but whenever country constituents came to
town they asked for more, taking care to give the very worst motives
to George's intimacy with the theatre, and to suppose that he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) and the
actresses were on terms of the most disgraceful intimacy. An august
personage having been to the theatre, and expressed his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) approbation
of Mr. Warrington's drama to Sir Miles, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) attended his (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) R-y-l
H-ghn-ss's levee at Saville House, Sir Miles, to be sure, modified his (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>)
opinion regarding the piece, and spoke henceforth more respectfully of
it. Meanwhile, as we have said, George was passing his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) life entirely
careless of the opinion of all the uncles, aunts, and cousins in the
world.

<p/>Most of the Esmond cousins were at least more polite and cordial than
George's kinsfolk of the Warrington side. In spite of his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) behaviour over
the cards, Lord Castlewood, George always maintained, had a liking for
our Virginians, and George was pleased enough to be in his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) company. He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
was a far abler man than many who succeeded in life. He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) had a good name,
and somehow only stained it; a considerable wit, and nobody trusted it;
and a very shrewd experience and knowledge of mankind, which made him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
mistrust them, and himself most of all, and which perhaps was the bar
to his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) own advancement. My Lady Castlewood, a woman of the world, wore
always a bland mask, and received Mr. George with perfect civility,
and welcomed him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) to lose as many guineas as he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) liked at her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) ladyship's
card-tables. Between Mr. William and the Virginian brothers there never
was any love lost; but, as for Lady Maria, though her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) love affair was
over, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) had no rancour; she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) professed for her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) cousins a very
great regard and affection, a part of which the young gentlemen very
gratefully returned. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) was charmed to hear of Harry's valour in the
campaign; she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) was delighted with George's success at the theatre; she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>)
was for ever going to the play, and had all the favourite passages of
Carpezan by heart. One day, as Mr. George and Miss Theo were taking a
sentimental walk in Kensington Gardens, whom should they light upon
but their cousin Maria in company with a gentleman in a smart suit and
handsome laced hat, and who should the gentleman be but his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) Majesty
King Louis of Hungary, Mr. Hagan? He (<font color='blue'><b>Hagan</b></font>) saluted the party, and left them
presently. Lady Maria had only just happened to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Hagan</b></font>). Mr. Hagan came
sometimes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hagan</b></font>) said, for quiet, to study his (<font color='blue'><b>Hagan</b></font>) parts in Kensington Gardens,
and George and the two ladies walked together to Lord Castlewood's door
in Kensington Square, Lady Maria uttering a thousand compliments to Theo
upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) good looks, upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) virtue, upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) future happiness, upon
her (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) papa and mamma, upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) destined husband, upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) paduasoy cloak
and dear little feet and shoe-buckles.

<p/>Harry happened to come to London that evening, and slept at his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
accustomed quarters. When George appeared at breakfast, the Captain
was already in the room -LRB-the custom of that day was to call all army
gentlemen Captains-RRB-, and looking at the letters on the breakfast-table.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, George,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) cries, <div class="bookquote">``there is a letter from Maria!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Little boy bring it from Common Garden last night--Master George
asleep,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>says Gumbo.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What can it be about?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>asks Harry, as George peruses his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) letter with a
queer expression of face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``About my play, to be sure,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>George answers, tearing up the paper, and
still wearing his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) queer look.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) is not writing love-letters to you, is she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>), Georgy?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, certainly not to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>replies the other. But he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) spoke no word more
about the letter; and when at dinner in Dean Street Mrs. Lambert said,
<div class="bookquote">``So you met somebody walking with the King of Hungary yesterday in
Kensington Gardens?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Lambert/Lambert</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What little tell-tale told you? A mere casual rencontre--the King goes
there to study his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) parts, and Lady Maria happened to be crossing the
garden to visit some of the other King's servants at Kensington Palace.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>And so there was an end to that matter for the time being.

<p/>Other events were at hand fraught with interest to our Virginians. One
evening after Christmas, the two gentlemen, with a few more friends,
were met round General Lambert's supper-table; and among the company was
Harry's new Colonel of the 67th, Major-General Wolfe. The young General
was more than ordinarily grave. The conversation all related to the war.
Events of great importance were pending. The great minister now in power
was determined to carry on the war on a much more extended scale than
had been attempted hitherto: an army was ordered to Germany to help
Prince Ferdinand, another great expedition was preparing for America,
and here, says Mr. Lambert, <div class="bookquote">``I will give you the health of the
Commander--a glorious campaign, and a happy return to him (<font color='blue'><b>Commander</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lambert</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why do you not drink the toast, General James!''  (<font color='red'><b>the hostess</b></font>)</div>asked the hostess of
her (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>) guest.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) must not drink his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) own toast,''  (<font color='red'><b>General</b></font>)</div>says General Lambert; <div class="bookquote">``it is we must
do that!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hetty/Miss Hetty/Lambert</b></font>)</div><p/>What? was James appointed?--All the ladies must drink such a toast as
that, and they mingled their kind voices with the applause of the rest
of the company.

<p/>Why did he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) look so melancholy? the ladies asked of one another when they
withdrew. In after days they remembered his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) pale face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) has been parting from his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) sweetheart,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Lambert/Lambert</b></font>)</div>suggests
tender-hearted Mrs. Lambert. And at this sentimental notion, no doubt
all the ladies looked sad.

<p/>The gentlemen, meanwhile, continued their talk about the war and its
chances. Mr. Wolfe did not contradict the speakers when they said that
the expedition was to be directed against Canada.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>says Harry, <div class="bookquote">``I wish your regiment was going with you, and
that I might pay another visit to my old friends at Quebec.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div><p/>What, had Harry been there? Yes. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) described his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) visit to the place
five years before, and knew the city, and the neighbourhood, well. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
lays a number of bits of biscuit on the table before him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), and makes
a couple of rivulets of punch on each side. <div class="bookquote">``This fork is the Isle
d’Orleans,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>says he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``with the north and south branches of St. Lawrence
on each side. Here's the Low Town, with a battery--how many guns was
mounted there in our time, brother?--but at long shots from the St.
Joseph shore you might play the same game. Here's what they call the
little river, the St. Charles, and a bridge of boats with a tete du pont
over to the place of arms. Here's the citadel, and here's convents--ever
so many convents--and the cathedral; and here, outside the lines to the
west and south, is what they call the Plains of Abraham--where a certain
little affair took place, do you remember, brother? He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) and a young
officer of the Rousillon regiment ca ca'd at each other for twenty
minutes, and George pinked him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>), and then they jure'd each other an
amitie eternelle. Well it was for George: for his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) second saved his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) life
on that awful day of Braddock's defeat. He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) was a fine little fellow, and
I give his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) toast: Je bois a la sante du Chevalier de Florac!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What, can you speak French, too, Harry?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wolfe/Wolfe</b></font>)</div>asks Mr. Wolfe. The young man
looked at the General with eager eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>says he (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``I can speak, but not so well as George.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) remembers the city, and can place the batteries, you see, and
knows the ground a thousand times better than I do!''  (<font color='red'><b>the brother</b></font>)</div>cries the elder
brother.

<p/>The two elder officers exchanged looks with one another; Mr. Lambert
smiled and nodded, as if in reply to the mute queries of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) comrade: on
which the other spoke. <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Harry,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``if you have had enough of
fine folks, and White's, and horse-racing--''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, sir!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>says the young man, turning very red.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And if you have a mind to a sea voyage at a short notice, come and see
me at my lodgings to-morrow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the ladies</b></font>)</div><p/>What was that sudden uproar of cheers which the ladies heard in their
drawing-room? It was the hurrah which Harry Warrington gave when he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>)
leaped up at hearing the General's invitation.

<p/>The women saw no more of the gentlemen that night. General Lambert had
to be away upon his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) business early next morning, before seeing any
of his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) family; nor had he (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) mentioned a word of Harry's outbreak on the
previous evening. But when he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) rejoined his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) folks at dinner, a look at
Miss Hetty's face informed the worthy gentleman that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) knew what had
passed on the night previous, and what was about to happen to the young
Virginian. After dinner Mrs. Lambert sat demurely at her (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) work, Miss
Theo took her (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) book of Italian Poetry. Neither of the General's customary
guests happened to be present that evening.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) took little Hetty's hand in his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>), and began to talk with her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>)
did not allude to the subject which he (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) knew was uppermost in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) mind,
except that by a more than ordinary gentleness and kindness he (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) perhaps
caused her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) to understand that her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) thoughts were known to him (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have breakfasted,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>says he (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``with James Wolfe this morning, and our
friend Harry was of the party. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) and the other guests were gone, I
remained and talked with James about the great expedition on which he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) is
going to sail. Would that his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) brave father had lived a few months longer
to see him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) come back covered with honours from Louisbourg, and knowing
that all England was looking to him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) to achieve still greater glory!
James is dreadfully ill in body--so ill that I am frightened for
him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>)--and not a little depressed in mind at having to part from the young
lady whom he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) has loved so long. A little rest, he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) thinks, might have set
his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) shattered frame up; and to call her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) has been the object of his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>)
life. But, great as his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) love is -LRB-and he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) is as romantic as one of you
young folks of seventeen-RRB-, honour and duty are greater, and he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) leaves
home, and wife, and ease, and health, at their bidding. Every man of
honour would do the like; every woman who loves him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) truly would buckle
on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) armour for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). James goes to take leave of his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) mother to-night;
and though she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) loves him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) devotedly, and is one of the tenderest women

<p/>CHAPTER LXVIII. In which Harry goes westward


<p/>Our tender hearts are averse to all ideas and descriptions of parting;
and I shall therefore say nothing of Harry Warrington's feelings at
taking leave of his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) brother and friends. Were not thousands of men in
the same plight? Had not Mr. Wolfe his (<font color='blue'><b>Wolfe</b></font>) mother to kiss -LRB-his (<font color='blue'><b>Wolfe</b></font>) brave father
had quitted life during his (<font color='blue'><b>Wolfe</b></font>) son's absence on the glorious Louisbourg
campaign-RRB-, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Wolfe</b></font>) sweetheart to clasp in a farewell embrace? Had not
stout Admiral Holmes, before sailing westward with his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) squadron, The
Somerset, The Terrible, The Northumberland, The Royal William, The
Trident, The Diana, The Seahorse--his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) own flag being hoisted on board
The Dublin--to take leave of Mrs. and the Misses Holmes? Was Admiral
Saunders, who sailed the day after him (<font color='blue'><b>Saunders</b></font>), exempt from human feeling?
Away go William and his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) crew of jovial sailors, ploughing through the
tumbling waves, and poor Black-eyed Susan on shore watches the ship as
it dwindles in the sunset.

<p/>It dwindles in the West. The night falls darkling over the ocean. They
are gone: but their hearts are at home yet a while. In silence, with a
heart inexpressibly soft and tender, how each man thinks of those he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has
left! What a chorus of pitiful prayer rises up to the Father, at sea and
on shore, on that parting night at home by the vacant bedside, where
the wife kneels in tears; round the fire, where the mother and children
together pour out their supplications: or on deck, where the seafarer
looks up to the stars of heaven, as the ship cleaves through the roaring
midnight waters! To-morrow the sun rises upon our common life again, and
we commence our daily task of toil and duty.

<p/>George accompanies his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) brother, and stays a while with him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) at Portsmouth
whilst they are waiting for a wind. He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) shakes Mr. Wolfe's hand, looks
at his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) pale face for the last time, and sees the vessels depart amid the
clangour of bells, and the thunder of cannon from the shore. Next day he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
is back at his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) home, and at that business which is sure one of the most
selfish and absorbing of the world's occupations, to which almost every
man who is thirty years old has served ere this his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) apprenticeship. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
has a pang of sadness, as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) looks in at the lodgings to the little room
which Harry used to occupy, and sees his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) half-burned papers still in
the grate. In a few minutes he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) is on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) way to Dean Street again,
and whispering by the fitful firelight in the ear of the clinging
sweetheart. She (<font color='blue'><b>sweetheart</b></font>) is very happy--oh, so happy! at his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) return. She (<font color='blue'><b>sweetheart</b></font>) is
ashamed of being so. Is it not heartless to be so, when poor Hetty is so
melancholy? Poor little Hetty! Indeed, it is selfish to be glad when she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
is in such a sad way. It makes one quite wretched to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Don't,
sir! Well, I ought to be wretched, and it's very, very wicked of me if
I'm not,''  (<font color='red'><b>Theo</b></font>)</div>says Theo; and one can understand her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) soft-hearted repentance.
What she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) means by <div class="bookquote">``Don't''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>who can tell? I have said the room was dark,
and the fire burned fitfully--and <div class="bookquote">``Don't''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>is no doubt uttered in one
of the dark fits. Enter servants with supper and lights. The family
arrives; the conversation becomes general. The destination of the fleet
is known everywhere now. The force on board is sufficient to beat all
the French in Canada; and, under such an officer as Wolfe, to repair the
blunders and disasters of previous campaigns. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wolfe</b></font>) looked dreadfully ill,
indeed. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Wolfe</b></font>) has a great soul in a feeble body. The ministers, the
country hope the utmost from him (<font color='blue'><b>Wolfe</b></font>). After supper, according to custom, Mr.
Lambert assembles his (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) modest household, of whom George Warrington may
be said quite to form a part; and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) prays for all travellers by land
and water, Theo and her (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) sister are kneeling together. And so, as the
ship speeds farther and farther into the West, the fond thoughts pursue
it; and the night passes, and the sun rises.

<p/>A day or two more, and everybody is at his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) books or his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) usual work. As
for George Warrington, that celebrated dramatist is busy about another
composition. When the tragedy of Carpezan had run some thirty or
twoscore nights, other persons of genius took possession of the theatre.

<p/>There may have been persons who wondered how the town could be so fickle
as ever to tire of such a masterpiece as the Tragedy--who could not bear
to see the actors dressed in other habits, reciting other men's verses;
but George, of a sceptical turn of mind, took the fate of his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) Tragedy
very philosophically, and pocketed the proceeds with much quiet
satisfaction. From Mr. Dodsley, the bookseller, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dodsley</b></font>) had the usual
complement of a hundred pounds; from the manager of the theatre two
hundred or more; and such praises from the critics and his (<font color='blue'><b>Dodsley</b></font>) friends, that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Dodsley</b></font>) set to work to prepare another piece, with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Dodsley</b></font>) hoped to achieve
even greater successes than by his (<font color='blue'><b>Dodsley</b></font>) first performance.

<p/>Over these studies, and the other charming business which occupies him (<font color='blue'><b>Dodsley</b></font>),
months pass away. Happy business! Happiest time of youth and life,
when love is first spoken and returned; when the dearest eyes are daily
shining welcome, and the fondest lips never tire of whispering their
sweet secrets; when the parting look that accompanies <div class="bookquote">``Good night!''
 (<font color='red'><b>youth life</b></font>)</div>gives delightful warning of to-morrow; when the heart is so overflowing
with love and happiness, that it has to spare for all the world; when
the day closes with glad prayers, and opens with joyful hopes; when
doubt seems cowardice, misfortune impossible, poverty only a sweet trial
of constancy! Theo's elders, thankfully remembering their own prime,
sit softly by and witness this pretty comedy performed by their young
people. And in one of his (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) later letters, dutifully written to his (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) wife
during a temporary absence from home, George Warrington records how he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>)
had been to look up at the windows of the dear old house in Dean Street,
and wondered who was sitting in the chamber where he (<font color='blue'><b>Dean</b></font>) and Theo had been
so happy.

<p/>Meanwhile we can learn how the time passes, and our friends are engaged,
by some extracts from George's letters to his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) brother.


<p/>``From the old window opposite Bedford Gardens, this 20th August 1759.

<p/>``Why are you gone back to rugged rocks, bleak shores, burning summers,
nipping winters, at home, when you might have been cropping ever so many
laurels in Germany? Kingsley's are coming back as covered with `em as
Jack-a-Green on May-day. Our six regiments did wonders; and our horse
would have done if my Lord George Sackville only had let them. But when
Prince Ferdinand said `Charge!' his (<font color='blue'><b>Ferdinand</b></font>) lordship could not hear, or could
not translate the German word for `Forward;' and so we only beat the
French, without utterly annihilating them, as we might, had Lord Granby
or Mr. Warrington had the command. My lord is come back to town, and
is shouting for a Court-Martial. He (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) held his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) head high enough in
prosperity: in misfortune he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) shows such a constancy of arrogance that
one almost admires him (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) looks as if he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) rather envied poor Mr. Byng,
and the not shooting him (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) were a manque d’egards towards him (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>).

<p/>``The Duke has had notice to get himself in readiness for departing
from this world of grandeurs and victories, and downfalls and
disappointments. An attack of palsy has visited his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) Royal Highness; and
pallida mors has just peeped in at his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) door, as it were, and said,
`I will call again.' Tyrant as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tyrant</b></font>) was, this prince has been noble in
disgrace; and no king has ever had a truer servant than ours has found
in his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) son. Why do I like the losing side always, and am I disposed to
revolt against the winners? Your famous Mr. P--, your chief's patron
and discoverer, I have been to hear in the House of Commons twice or
thrice. I revolt against his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) magniloquence. I wish some little David
would topple over that swelling giant. His (<font color='blue'><b>David</b></font>) thoughts and his (<font color='blue'><b>David</b></font>) language are
always attitudinising. I like Barry's manner best, though the other is
the more awful actor.

<p/>``Pocahontas gets on apace. Barry likes his (<font color='blue'><b>Barry</b></font>) part of Captain Smith; and,
though he (<font color='blue'><b>Barry</b></font>) will have him (<font color='blue'><b>Barry</b></font>) wear a red coat and blue facings and an epaulet,
I have a fancy to dress him (<font color='blue'><b>Barry</b></font>) exactly like one of the pictures of Queen
Elizabeth's gentlemen at Hampton Court: with a ruff and a square beard
and square shoes. `And Pocahontas--would you like her (<font color='blue'><b>Pocahontas</b></font>) to be tattooed?'
asks Uncle Lambert. Hagan's part as the warrior who is in love with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Pocahontas</b></font>), and, seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Pocahontas</b></font>) partiality for the captain, nobly rescues him (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) from
death, I trust will prove a hit. A strange fish is this Hagan: his (<font color='blue'><b>Hagan</b></font>) mouth
full of stage-plays and rant, but good, honest, and brave, if I don't
err. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hagan</b></font>) is angry at having been cast lately for Sir O’Brallaghan, in Mr.
Macklin's new farce of Love A-la-mode. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) says that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) does not keer to
disgreece his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) tongue with imiteetions of that rascal brogue. As if there
was any call for imiteetions, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) has such an admirable twang of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>)
own!

<p/>``Shall I tell you? Shall I hide the circumstance? Shall I hurt your
feelings? Shall I set you in a rage of jealousy, and cause you to ask
for leave to return to Europe? Know, then, that though Carpezan is
long since dead, cousin Maria is for ever coming to the playhouse. Tom
Spencer has spied her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) out night after night in the gallery, and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) comes on the nights when Hagan performs. Quick, Burroughs, Mr.
Warrington's boots and portmanteau! Order a chaise and four for
Portsmouth immediately! The letter which I burned one morning when we
were at breakfast -LRB-I may let the cat out of the bag, now puss has such a
prodigious way to run-RRB- was from cousin M., hinting that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) wished me
to tell no tales about her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>): but I can't help just whispering to you
that Maria at this moment is busy consoling herself as fast as possible.
Shall I spoil sport? Shall I tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) brother? Is the affair any
business of mine? What have the Esmonds done for you and me but win
our money at cards? Yet I like our noble cousin. It seems to me that he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>)
would be good if he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) could--or rather, he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) would have been once. He (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) has
been set on a wrong way of life, from which `tis now probably too late
to rescue him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>). O beati agricolae! Our Virginia was dull, but let us
thank Heaven we were bred there. We were made little slaves, but not
slaves to wickedness, gambling, bad male and female company. It was not
until my poor Harry left home that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) fell among thieves. I mean thieves
en grand, such as waylaid him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) and stripped him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) on English highroads. I
consider you none the worse because you were the unlucky one, and had
to deliver your purse up. And now you are going to retrieve, and make
a good name for yourself; and kill more `French dragons,' and become a
great commander. And our mother will talk of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) son the Captain, the
Colonel, the General, and have his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) picture painted with all his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) stars
and epaulets, when poor I shall be but a dawdling poetaster, or, if we
may hope for the best, a snug placeman, with a little box at Richmond
or Kew, and a half-score of little picaninnies, that will come and bob
curtseys at the garden-gate when their uncle the General rides up on his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>)
great charger, with his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) aide-de-camp's pockets filled with gingerbread
for the nephews and nieces. `Tis for you to brandish the sword of Mars.
As for me, I look forward to a quiet life: a quiet little home, a quiet
little library full of books, and a little Some one dulce ridentem,
dulce loquentem, on t'other side of the fire, as I scribble away at my
papers. I am so pleased with this prospect, so utterly contented and
happy, that I feel afraid as I think of it, lest it should escape me;
and, even to my dearest Hal, am shy of speaking of my happiness. What is
ambition to me, with this certainty? What do I care for wars, with this
beatific peace smiling near?

<p/>CHAPTER LXIX. A Little Innocent


<p/>George Warrington has mentioned in the letter just quoted, that in spite
of my Lord Castlewood's previous play transactions with Harry, my lord
and George remained friends, and met on terms of good kinsmanship. Did
George want franks, or an introduction at court, or a place in the House
of Lords to hear a debate, his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) cousin was always ready to serve him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>),
was a pleasant and witty companion, and would do anything which might
promote his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) relative's interests, provided his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) own were not prejudiced.

<p/>Now he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) even went so far as to promise that he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) would do his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) best with the
people in power to provide a place for Mr. George Warrington, who daily
showed a greater disinclination to return to his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) native country, and
place himself once more under the maternal servitude. George had not
merely a sentimental motive for remaining in England: the pursuits and
society of London pleased him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) infinitely better than any which he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) could
have at home. A planter's life of idleness might have suited him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>), could
he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) have enjoyed independence with it. But in Virginia he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) was only the
first, and, as he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) thought, the worst treated, of his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) mother's subjects.
He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) dreaded to think of returning with his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) young bride to his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) home, and
of the life which she (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) would be destined to lead there. Better freedom
and poverty in England, with congenial society, and a hope perchance of
future distinction, than the wearisome routine of home life, the tedious
subordination, the frequent bickerings, the certain jealousies and
differences of opinion, to which he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) must subject his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) wife so soon as
they turned their faces homeward.

<p/>So Lord Castlewood's promise to provide for George was very eagerly
accepted by the Virginian. My lord had not provided very well for
his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) own brother to be sure, and his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) own position, peer as he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) was, was
anything but enviable; but we believe what we wish to believe, and
George Warrington chose to put great stress upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) kinsman's offer
of patronage. Unlike the Warrington family, Lord Castlewood was quite
gracious when he (<font color='blue'><b>Castlewood</b></font>) was made acquainted with George's engagement to Miss
Lambert; came to wait upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) parents; praised George to them and the
young lady to George, and made himself so prodigiously agreeable in
their company that these charitable folk forgot his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) bad reputation, and
thought it must be a very wicked and scandalous world which maligned
him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) said, indeed, that he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) was improved in their society, as every
man must be who came into it. Among them he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was witty, lively, good for
the time being. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) left his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wickedness and worldliness with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cloak
in the hall, and only put them on again when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stepped into his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) chair.
What worldling on life's voyage does not know of some such harbour of
rest and calm, some haven where he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) puts in out of the storm? Very likely
Lord Castlewood was actually better whilst he (<font color='blue'><b>Castlewood</b></font>) stayed with those good
people, and for the time being at least no hypocrite.

<p/>And, I dare say, the Lambert elders thought no worse of his (<font color='blue'><b>hypocrite</b></font>) lordship for
openly proclaiming his (<font color='blue'><b>hypocrite</b></font>) admiration for Miss Theo. It was quite genuine,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>hypocrite</b></font>) did not profess it was very deep.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It don't affect my sleep, and I am not going to break my heart because
Miss Lambert prefers somebody else,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>hypocrite</b></font>) remarked. Only I wish when I was
a young man, madam, I had had the good fortune to meet with somebody so
innocent and good as your daughter. I might have been kept out of a deal
of harm's way: but innocent and good young women did not fall into mine,
or they would have made me better than I am.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sure, my lord, it is not too late!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Lambert/Lambert</b></font>)</div>says Mrs. Lambert, very softly.

<p/>Castlewood started back, misunderstanding her (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not too late, madam?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>hypocrite</b></font>) inquired.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) blushed. <div class="bookquote">``It is too late to court my dear daughter, my lord, but not
too late to repent. We read, `tis never too late to do that. If others
have been received at the eleventh hour, is there any reason why you
should give up hope?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps I know my own heart better than you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>hypocrite</b></font>) says in a plaintive
tone. <div class="bookquote">``I can speak French and German very well, and why? because I was
taught both in the nursery. A man who learns them late can never get the
practice of them on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) tongue. And so `tis the case with goodness, I
can't learn it at my age. I can only see others practise it, and admire
them. When I am on--on the side opposite to Lazarus, will Miss Theo give
me a drop of water? Don't frown! I know I shall be there, Mrs. Lambert.
Some folks are doomed so; and I think some of our family are amongst
these. Some people are vacillating, and one hardly knows which way
the scale will turn. Whereas some are predestined angels, and fly
Heavenwards naturally, and do what they will.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, my lord, and why should you not be of the predestined? Whilst there
is a day left--whilst there is an hour--there is hope!''  (<font color='red'><b>the matron</b></font>)</div>says the fond
matron.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I know what is passing in your mind, my dear madam--nay, I read your
prayers in your looks; but how can they avail?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord</b></font>)</div>Lord Castlewood asked
sadly. <div class="bookquote">``You don't know all, my good lady. You don't know what a life
ours is of the world; how early it began; how selfish Nature, and then
necessity and education, have made us. It is Fate holds the reins of
the chariot, and we can't escape our doom. I know better: I see better
people: I go my own way. My own? No, not mine--Fate's: and it is not
altogether without pity for us, since it allows us, from time to time,
to see such people as you.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) took her (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>) hand and looked her (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>) full
in the face, and bowed with a melancholy grace. Every word he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) said
was true. No greater error than to suppose that weak and bad men are
strangers to good feelings, or deficient of sensibility. Only the
good feeling does not last--nay, the tears are a kind of debauch of
sentiment, as old libertines are said to find that the tears and grief
of their victims add a zest to their pleasure. But Mrs. Lambert knew
little of what was passing in this man's mind -LRB-how should she (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>)?-RRB-, and
so prayed for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) with the fond persistence of woman. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was much
better--yes, much better than he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was supposed to be. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was a most
interesting man. There were hopes, why should there not be the most
precious hopes for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) still?

<p/>It remains to be seen which of the two speakers formed the correct
estimate of my lord's character. Meanwhile, if the gentleman was
right, the lady was mollified, and her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) kind wishes and prayers for
this experienced sinner's repentance, if they were of no avail for his (<font color='blue'><b>sinner</b></font>)
amendment, at least could do him (<font color='blue'><b>sinner</b></font>) no harm. Kind-souled doctors -LRB-and what
good woman is not of the faculty?-RRB- look after a reprobate as physicians
after a perilous case. When the patient is converted to health their
interest ceases in him (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>), and they drive to feel pulses and prescribe
medicines elsewhere.

<p/>But, while the malady was under treatment, our kind lady could not see
too much of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) sick man. Quite an intimacy sprung up between my Lord
Castlewood and the Lamberts. I am not sure that some worldly views might
not suit even with good Mrs. Lambert's spiritual plans -LRB-for who
knows into what pure Eden, though guarded by flaming-sworded angels,
worldliness will not creep?-RRB-. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) son was about to take orders. My Lord
Castlewood feared very much that his (<font color='blue'><b>Castlewood</b></font>) present chaplain's, Mr. Sampson's,
careless life and heterodox conversations might lead him (<font color='blue'><b>Castlewood</b></font>) to give up his (<font color='blue'><b>Castlewood</b></font>)
chaplaincy: in which case, my lord hinted the little modest cure would
be vacant, and at the service of some young divine of good principles
and good manners, who would be content with a small stipend, and a small
but friendly congregation.

<p/>Thus an acquaintance was established between the two families, and the
ladies of Castlewood, always on their good behaviour, came more than
once to make their curtseys in Mrs. Lambert's drawing-room. They were
civil to the parents and the young ladies. My Lady Castlewood's card
assemblies were open to Mrs. Lambert and her (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) family. There was play,
certainly--all the world played--his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) Majesty, the Bishops, every Peer
and Peeress in the land. But nobody need play who did not like; and
surely nobody need have scruples regarding the practice, when such
august and venerable personages were daily found to abet it. More than
once Mrs. Lambert made her (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) appearance at her (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) ladyship's routs, and
was grateful for the welcome which she (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) received, and pleased with the
admiration which her (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) daughters excited.

<p/>Mention has been made, in a foregoing page and letter, of an American
family of Dutch extraction, who had come to England very strongly
recommended by Madam Esmond, their Virginian neighbour, to her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) sons in
Europe. The views expressed in Madam Esmond's letter were so clear, that
that arch match-maker, Mrs. Lambert, could not but understand them. As
for George, he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) was engaged already; as for poor Hetty's flame, Harry, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
was gone on service, for which circumstance Hetty's mother was not very
sorry perhaps. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) laughingly told George that he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) ought to obey his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
mamma's injunctions, break off his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) engagement with Theo, and make up to
Miss Lydia, who was ten times--ten times! a hundred times as rich as
her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) poor girl, and certainly much handsomer. <div class="bookquote">``Yes, indeed,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>says George,
<div class="bookquote">``that I own: she (<font color='blue'><b>people</b></font>) is handsomer, and she (<font color='blue'><b>people</b></font>) is richer, and perhaps even
cleverer.''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>-LRB-All which praises Mrs. Lambert but half liked.-RRB- <div class="bookquote">``But say
she (<font color='blue'><b>people</b></font>) is all these? So is Mr. Johnson much cleverer than I am: so is, whom
shall we say?--so is Mr. Hagan the actor much taller and handsomer: so
is Sir James Lowther much richer: yet pray, ma’am, do you suppose I am
going to be jealous of any one of these three, or think my Theo would
jilt me for their sakes? Why should I not allow that Miss Lydia is
handsomer, then? and richer, and clever, too, and lively, and well bred,
if you insist on it, and an angel if you will have it so? Theo is not
afraid: art thou, child?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, George,''  (<font color='red'><b>Theo/Lady Theo</b></font>)</div>says Theo, with such an honest look of the eyes as would
convince any scepticism, or shame any jealousy. And if, after this pair
of speeches, mamma takes occasion to leave the room for a minute to
fetch her (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) scissors, or her (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) thimble, or a bootjack and slippers, or the
cross and ball on the top of St. Paul's, or her (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) pocket-handkerchief
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) has forgotten in the parlour--if, I say, Mrs. Lambert quits
the room on any errand or pretext, natural or preposterous, I shall not
be in the least surprised, if, at her (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) return in a couple of minutes, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>)
finds George in near proximity to Theo, who has a heightened colour, and
whose hand George is just dropping--I shall not have the least idea of
what they have been doing. Have you, madam? Have you any remembrance of
what used to happen when Mr. Grundy came a-courting? Are you, who, after
all, were not in the room with our young people, going to cry out fie
and for shame? Then fie and for shame upon you, Mrs. Grundy!

<p/>Well, Harry being away, and Theo and George irrevocably engaged, so
that there was no possibility of bringing Madam Esmond's little plans to
bear, why should not Mrs. Lambert have plans of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) own; and if a rich,
handsome, beautiful little wife should fall in his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) way, why should
not Jack Lambert from Oxford have her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)? So thinks mamma, who was always
thinking of marrying and giving in marriage, and so she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) prattles to
General Lambert, who, as usual, calls her (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) a goose for her (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) pains. At any
rate, Mrs. Lambert says beauty and riches are no objection; at any rate,
Madam Esmond desired that this family should be hospitably entertained,
and it was not her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) fault that Harry was gone away to Canada. Would
the General wish him (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) to come back; leave the army and his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) reputation,
perhaps; yes, and come to England and marry this American, and break
poor Hetty's heart--would her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) father wish that? Let us spare further
arguments, and not be so rude as to hint that Mr. Lambert was in the
right in calling a fond wife by the name of that absurd splay-footed
bird, annually sacrificed at the Feast of St. Michael.

<p/>In those early days, there were vast distinctions of rank drawn between
the court and city people: and Mr. Van den Bosch, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Bosch</b></font>) first came
to London, scarcely associated with any but the latter sort. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bosch</b></font>) had a
lodging near his (<font color='blue'><b>Bosch</b></font>) agent's in the city. When his (<font color='blue'><b>Bosch</b></font>) pretty girl came from
school for a holiday, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bosch</b></font>) took her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) an airing to Islington or Highgate, or
an occasional promenade in the Artillery Ground in Bunhill Fields. They
went to that Baptist meeting-house in Finsbury Fields, and on the sly
to see Mr. Garrick once or twice, or that funny rogue Mr. Foote, at
the Little Theatre. To go to a Lord Mayor's feast was a treat to the
gentleman of the highest order: and to dance with a young mercer at
Hampstead Assembly. gave the utmost delight to the young lady. When
George first went to wait upon his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) mother's friends, he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) found our old
acquaintance, Mr. Draper, of the Temple, sedulous in his (<font color='blue'><b>Draper</b></font>) attentions to
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>); and the lawyer, who was married, told Mr. Warrington to look out,
as the young lady had a plumb to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) fortune. Mr. Drabshaw, a young
Quaker gentleman, and nephew of Mr. Trail, Madam Esmond's Bristol agent,
was also in constant attendance upon the young lady, and in dreadful
alarm and suspicion when Mr. Warrington first made his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) appearance.
Wishing to do honour to his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) mother's neighbours, Mr. Warrington invited
them to an entertainment at his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) own apartments; and who should so
naturally meet them as his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) friends from Soho? Not one of them but was
forced to own little Miss Lydia's beauty. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) had the foot of a fairy:
the arms, neck, flashing eyes of a little brown huntress of Diana. She (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>)
had brought a little plaintive accent from home with her (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>)--of which I,
moi qui vous parle, have heard a hundred gross Cockney imitations, and
watched as many absurd disguises, and which I say -LRB-in moderation-RRB-
is charming in the mouth of a charming woman. Who sets up to say No,
forsooth? You dear Miss Whittington, with whose h's fate has dealt so
unkindly?--you lovely Miss Nicol Jarvie, with your northern burr?--you
beautiful Miss Molony, with your Dame Street warble? All accents are
pretty from pretty lips, and who shall set the standard up? Shall it be
a rose, or a thistle, or a shamrock, or a star and stripe? As for Miss
Lydia's accent, I have no doubt it was not odious even from the first
day when she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) set foot on these polite shores, otherwise Mr. Warrington,
as a man of taste, had certainly disapproved of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) manner of talking,
and her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) schoolmistress at Kensington had not done her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) duty by her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) pupil.

<p/>After the six months were over, during which, according to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) father's
calculation, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) was to learn all the accomplishments procurable at the
Kensington Academy, Miss Lydia returned nothing loth to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) grandfather,
and took her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) place in the world. A narrow world at first it was to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>);
but she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) was a resolute little person, and resolved to enlarge her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>)
sphere in society; and whither she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) chose to lead the way, the obedient
grandfather followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) had been thwarted himself in early life, he (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>)
said, and little good came of the severity he (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) underwent. He (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) had thwarted
his (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) own son, who had turned out but ill. As for little Lyddy, he (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) was
determined she (<font color='blue'><b>Lyddy</b></font>) should have as pleasant a life as was possible. Did not
Mr. George think he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) was right? `Twas said in Virginia--he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) did not
know with what reason--that the young gentlemen of Castlewood had been
happier if Madam Esmond had allowed them a little of their own way.
George could not gainsay this public rumour, or think of inducing
the benevolent old gentleman to alter his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) plans respecting his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
granddaughter. As for the Lambert family, how could they do otherwise
than welcome the kind old man, the parent so tender and liberal, Madam
Esmond's good friend?

<p/>When Miss came from school, grandpapa removed from Monument Yard to
an elegant house in Bloomsbury; whither they were followed at first by
their city friends. There were merchants from Virginia Walk; there were
worthy tradesmen, with whom the worthy old merchant had dealings; there
were their ladies and daughters and sons, who were all highly gracious
to Miss Lyddy. It would be a long task to describe how these disappeared
one by one--how there were no more junketings at Belsize, or trips
to Highgate, or Saturday jaunts to Deputy Higgs' villa, Highbury, or
country-dances at honest Mr. Lutestring's house at Hackney. Even the
Sunday practice was changed; and, oh, abomination of abominations! Mr.
Van den Bosch left Bethesda Chapel in Bunhill Row, and actually took a
pew in Queen Square Church!

<p/>Queen Square Church, and Mr. George Warrington lived hard by in
Southampton Row! `Twas easy to see at whom Miss Lyddy was setting her (<font color='blue'><b>Lyddy</b></font>)
cap, and Mr. Draper, who had been full of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lyddy</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Lyddy</b></font>) grandfather's
praises before, now took occasion to warn Mr. George, and gave him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) very
different reports regarding Mr. Van den Bosch to those which had
first been current. Mr. Van d. B., for all he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) bragged so of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) Dutch
parentage, came from Albany, and was nobody's son at all. He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) had made
his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) money by land speculation, or by privateering -LRB-which was uncommonly
like piracy-RRB-, and by the Guinea trade. His (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) son had married--if marriage
it could be called, which was very doubtful--an assigned servant, and
had been cut off by his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) father, and had taken to bad courses, and had
died, luckily for himself, in his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) own bed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Draper has told you bad tales about me,''  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>said the placid old
gentleman to George. <div class="bookquote">``Very likely we are all sinners, and some evil may
be truly said of all of us, with a great deal more that is untrue. Did
he (<font color='blue'><b>Draper</b></font>) tell you that my son was unhappy with me? I told you so too. Did he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)
bring you wicked stories about my family? He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) liked it so well that he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)
wanted to marry my Lyddy to his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) brother. Heaven bless her (<font color='blue'><b>Draper</b></font>)! I have had a
many offers for her (<font color='blue'><b>Draper</b></font>). And you are the young gentleman I should have chose
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Draper</b></font>), and I like you none the worse because you prefer somebody else;
though what you can see in your Miss, as compared to my Lyddy, begging
your honour's pardon, I am at a loss to understand.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There is no accounting for tastes, my good sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>said Mr. George, with
his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) most superb air.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, sir; `tis a wonder of nature, and daily happens. When I kept store
to Albany, there was one of your tiptop gentry there that might have
married my dear daughter that was alive then, and with a pretty piece
of money, whereby--for her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) father and I had quarrelled--Miss Lyddy would
have been a pauper, you see: and in place of my beautiful Bella, my
gentleman chooses a little homely creature, no prettier than your Miss,
and without a dollar to her (<font color='blue'><b>Bella</b></font>) fortune. The more fool he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>), saving your
presence, Mr. George.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pray don't save my presence, my good sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>says George, laughing. <div class="bookquote">``I
suppose the gentleman's word was given to the other lady, and he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had
seen her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) first, and hence was indifferent to your charming daughter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose when a young fellow gives his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) word to perform a cursed piece
of folly, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) always sticks to it, my dear sir, begging your pardon. But
Lord, Lord, what am I speaking of? I am aspeaking of twenty year ago. I
was well-to-do then, but I may say Heaven has blessed my store, and I am
three times as well off now. Ask my agents how much they will give for
Joseph Van den Bosch's bill at six months on New York--or at sight may
be for forty thousand pound? I warrant they will discount the paper.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Happy he (<font color='blue'><b>Van</b></font>) who has the bill, sir!''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>says George, with a bow, not a little
amused with the candour of the old gentleman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Lord, Lord, how mercenary you young men are!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>cries the elder, simply.
<div class="bookquote">``Always thinking about money nowadays! Happy he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) who has the girl, I
should say--the money ain't the question, my dear sir, when it goes
along with such a lovely young thing as that--though I humbly say it,
who oughtn't, and who am her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) fond silly old grandfather. We were talking
about you, Lyddy darling--come, give me a kiss, my blessing! We were
talking about you, and Mr. George said he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) wouldn't take you with all the
money your poor old grandfather can give you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>says George.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, you are right to say nay, for I didn't say all, that's the truth.
My Blessing will have a deal more than that trifle I spoke of, when it
shall please Heaven to remove me out of this world to a better--when
poor old Gappy is gone, Lyddy will be a rich little Lyddy, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lyddy</b></font>)
will. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Lyddy</b></font>) don't wish me to go yet, does she (<font color='blue'><b>Lyddy</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, you darling dear grandpapa!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lyddy/Miss Lyddy</b></font>)</div>says Lyddy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This young gentleman won't have you.''  (<font color='red'><b>Lyddy/Miss Lyddy</b></font>)</div>-LRB-Lyddy looks an arch <div class="bookquote">``Thank you,
sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lyddy/Miss Lyddy</b></font>)</div>from her (<font color='blue'><b>Lyddy</b></font>) brown eyes.-RRB- <div class="bookquote">``But at any rate he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) is honest, and that
is more than we can say of some folks in this wicked London. Oh, Lord,
Lord, how mercenary they are! Do you know that yonder, in Monument Yard,
they were all at my poor little Blessing for her (<font color='blue'><b>Lyddy</b></font>) money? There was
Tom Lutestring; there was Mr. Draper, your precious lawyer; there was
actually Mr. Tubbs, of Bethesda Chapel; and they must all come buzzing
like flies round the honey-pot. That is why we came out of the quarter
where my brother-tradesmen live.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To avoid the flies,--to be sure!''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Lydia/Lydia</b></font>)</div>says Miss Lydia, tossing up her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>)
little head.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where my brother-tradesmen live,''  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>continues the old gentleman. <div class="bookquote">``Else
who am I to think of consorting with your grandees and fine folk? I
don't care for the fashions, Mr. George; I don't care for plays and
poetry, begging your honour's pardon; I never went to a play in my life,
but to please this little minx.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, sir, `twas lovely! and I cried so, didn't I, grandpapa?''  (<font color='red'><b>the child</b></font>)</div>says the
child.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``At what, my dear?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``At--at Mr. Warrington's play, grandpapa.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did you, my dear? I dare say; I dare say! It was mail day: and my
letters had come in: and my ship the Lovely Lyddy had just come into
Falmouth; and Captain Joyce reported how he (<font color='blue'><b>Joyce</b></font>) had mercifully escaped a
French privateer; and my head was so full of thanks for that escape,
which saved me a deal of money, Mr. George--for the rate at which ships
is underwrote this war-time is so scandalous that I often prefer to
venture than to insure--that I confess I didn't listen much to the play,
sir, and only went to please this little Lyddy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you did please me, dearest Gappy!''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>cries the young lady.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Bless you! then it's all I want. What does a man want more here below
than to please his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) children, Mr. George? especially me, who knew what
was to be unhappy when I was young, and to repent of having treated this
darling's father too hard.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, grandpapa!''  (<font color='red'><b>the child</b></font>)</div>cries the child, with more caresses.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I was too hard with him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), dear; and that's why I spoil my little
Lydkin so!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lyddy/Miss Lyddy</b></font>)</div><p/>More kisses ensue between Lyddy and Gappy. The little creature flings
the pretty polished arms round the old man's neck, presses the dark red
lips on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) withered cheek, surrounds the venerable head with a halo of
powder beaten out of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wig by her (<font color='blue'><b>Lyddy</b></font>) caresses; and eyes Mr. George the
while, as much as to say, There, sir! should you not like me to do as
much for you?

<p/>We confess;--but do we confess all? George certainly told the story of
his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) interview with Lyddy and Gappy, and the old man's news regarding his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
granddaughter's wealth; but I don't think he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) told everything; else Theo
would scarce have been so much interested, or so entirely amused and
good-humoured with Lyddy when next the two young ladies met.

<p/>They met now pretty frequently, especially after the old American
gentleman took up his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) residence in Bloomsbury. Mr. Van den Bosch was
in the city for the most part of the day, attending to his (<font color='blue'><b>Bosch</b></font>) affairs, and
appearing at his (<font color='blue'><b>Bosch</b></font>) place upon `Change. During his (<font color='blue'><b>Bosch</b></font>) absence Lyddy had the
command of the house, and received her (<font color='blue'><b>Lyddy</b></font>) guests there like a lady, or rode
abroad in a fine coach, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Lyddy</b></font>) ordered her (<font color='blue'><b>Lyddy</b></font>) grandpapa to keep for her (<font color='blue'><b>Lyddy</b></font>),
and into which he (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) could very seldom be induced to set his (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) foot. Before
long Miss Lyddy was as easy in the coach as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Lyddy</b></font>) had ridden in one
all her (<font color='blue'><b>Lyddy</b></font>) life. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lyddy</b></font>) ordered the domestics here and there; she (<font color='blue'><b>Lyddy</b></font>) drove to the
mercer's and the jeweller's, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Lyddy</b></font>) called upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Lyddy</b></font>) friends with the
utmost stateliness, or rode abroad with them to take the air. Theo and
Hetty were both greatly diverted with her (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>): but would the elder have been
quite as well pleased had she (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) known all Miss Lyddy's doings? Not that
Theo was of a jealous disposition,--far otherwise; but there are cases
when a lady has a right to a little jealousy, as I maintain, whatever my
fair readers may say to the contrary.

<p/>It was because she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) knew he (<font color='blue'><b>jeweller</b></font>) was engaged, very likely, that Miss Lyddy
permitted herself to speak so frankly in Mr. George's praise. When they
were alone--and this blessed chance occurred pretty often at Mr. Van den
Bosch's house, for we have said he (<font color='blue'><b>Bosch</b></font>) was constantly absent on one errand
or the other--it was wonderful how artlessly the little creature would
show her (<font color='blue'><b>Lyddy</b></font>) enthusiasm, asking him (<font color='blue'><b>Bosch</b></font>) all sorts of simple questions about
himself, his (<font color='blue'><b>Bosch</b></font>) genius, his (<font color='blue'><b>Bosch</b></font>) way of life at home and in London, his (<font color='blue'><b>Bosch</b></font>) projects
of marriage, and so forth.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am glad you are going to be married, oh, so glad!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Lyddy</b></font>) would say,
heaving the most piteous sigh the while; <div class="bookquote">``for I can talk to you frankly,
quite frankly as a brother, and not be afraid of that odious politeness
about which they were always scolding me at boarding-school. I may speak
to you frankly; and if I like you, I may say so, mayn't I, Mr. George?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pray, say so,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>says George, with a bow and a smile. <div class="bookquote">``That is a kind of
talk which most men delight to hear, especially from such pretty lips as
Miss Lydia's.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you know about my lips?''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>says the girl, with a pout and an
innocent look into his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What, indeed?''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>asks George. <div class="bookquote">``Perhaps I should like to know a great deal
more.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They don't tell nothin' but truth, anyhow!''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>says the girl; <div class="bookquote">``that's why
some people don't like them! If I have anything on my mind, it must
come out. I am a country-bred girl, I am--with my heart in my mouth--all
honesty and simplicity; not like your English girls, who have learned I
don't know what at their boarding-schools, and from the men afterwards.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Our girls are monstrous little hypocrites, indeed!''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>cries George.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are thinking of Miss Lamberts? and I might have thought of them;
but I declare I did not then. They have been at boarding-school; they
have been in the world a great deal--so much the greater pity for them,
for be certain they learned no good there. And now I have said so, of
course you will go and tell Miss Theo, won't you, sir?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That she (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) has learned no good in the world? She (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) has scarce spoken to men
at all, except her (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) father, her (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) brother, and me. Which of us would teach
her (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) any wrong, think you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, not you! Though I can understand its being very dangerous to be
with you!''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>says the girl, with a sigh.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed there is no danger, and I don't bite!''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>says George, laughing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I didn't say bite,''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>says the girl, softly. <div class="bookquote">``There's other things
dangerous besides biting, I should think. Aren't you very witty? Yes,
and sarcastic, and clever, and always laughing at people? Haven't you
a coaxing tongue? If you was to look at me in that kind of way, I don't
know what would come to me. Was your brother like you, as I was to have
married? Was he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) as clever and witty as you? I have heard he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) was like
you: but he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) hadn't your coaxing tongue. Heigho! `Tis well you are
engaged, Master George, that is all. Do you think if you had seen me
first, you would have liked Miss Theo best?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They say marriages were made in Heaven, my dear, and let us trust that
mine has been arranged there,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>says George.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose there was no such thing never known, as a man having two
sweethearts?''  (<font color='red'><b>the maiden</b></font>)</div>asks the artless little maiden. <div class="bookquote">``Guess it's a pity. O me!
What nonsense I'm a-talking; there now! I'm like the little girl who
cried for the moon; and I can't have it. `Tis too high for me--too
high and splendid and shining: can't reach up to it nohow. Well, what
a foolish, wayward, little spoilt thing I am now! But one thing you
promise.-on your word and your honour, now, Mr. George?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And what is that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That you won't tell Miss Theo, else she (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>)'ll hate me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why should she (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) hate you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because I hate her (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>), and wish she (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) was dead!''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>breaks out the young lady.
And the eyes that were looking so gentle and lachrymose but now, flame
with sudden wrath, and her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) cheeks flush up. <div class="bookquote">``For shame!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) adds, after
a pause. <div class="bookquote">``I'm a little fool to speak! But whatever is in my heart must
come out. I am a girl of the woods, I am. I was bred where the sun is
hotter than in this foggy climate. And I am not like your cold English
girls; who, before they speak, or think, or feel, must wait for mamma to
give leave. There, there! I may be a little fool for saying what I have.
I know you'll go and tell Miss Lambert. Well, do!''

 (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div><p/>But, as we have said, George didn't tell Miss Lambert. Even from the
beloved person there must be some things kept secret; even to himself,
perhaps, he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) did not quite acknowledge what was the meaning of the little
girl's confession; or, if he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) acknowledged it, did not act on it; except
in so far as this, perhaps, that my gentleman, in Miss Lydia's presence,
was particularly courteous and tender; and in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) absence thought of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>)
very kindly, and always with a certain pleasure. It were hard, indeed,
if a man might not repay by a little kindness and gratitude the artless
affection of such a warm young heart.

<p/>What was that story meanwhile which came round to our friends, of young
Mr. Lutestring and young Mr. Drabshaw the Quaker having a boxing-match
at a tavern in the city, and all about this young lady? They fell
out over their cups, and fought probably. Why did Mr. Draper, who had
praised her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) so at first, tell such stories now against her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) grandfather?
<div class="bookquote">``I suspect,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bernstein/Madame de Bernstein/Madame Bernstein</b></font>)</div>says Madame de Bernstein, <div class="bookquote">``that he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) wants the girl for some
client or relation of his (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) own; and that he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) tells these tales in order to
frighten all suitors from her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). When she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) grandfather came to me,
she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) behaved perfectly well; and I confess, sir, I thought it was a great
pity that you should prefer yonder red-cheeked countrified little chit,
without a halfpenny, to this pretty, wild, artless girl, with such a
fortune as I hear she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) has.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Bernstein/Madame de Bernstein/Madame Bernstein</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) has been with you, has she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), aunt?''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>asks George of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>) relative.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) has been with me,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>the other replies, curtly. <div class="bookquote">``Unless
your brother has been so silly as to fall in love with that other little
Lambert girl--''

 (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed, ma’am, I think I can say he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) has not,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>George remarks.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, then, when he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) comes back with Mr. Wolfe, should he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) not take
a fancy to this little person, as his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) mamma wishes--only, to do us
justice, we Esmonds care very little for what our mammas wish--and marry
her (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>), and set up beside you in Virginia? She (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) is to have a great fortune,
which you won't touch. Pray, why should it go out of the family?''

 (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div><p/>George now learned that Mr. Van den Bosch and his (<font color='blue'><b>Bosch</b></font>) granddaughter had been
often at Madame de Bernstein's house. Taking his (<font color='blue'><b>Bosch</b></font>) favourite walk with his (<font color='blue'><b>Bosch</b></font>)
favourite companion to Kensington Gardens, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bosch</b></font>) saw Mr. Van den Bosch's
chariot turning into Kensington Square. The Americans were going to
visit Lady Castlewood, then? He (<font color='blue'><b>Bosch</b></font>) found, on some little inquiry, that they
had been more than once with her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) ladyship. It was, perhaps, strange
that they should have said nothing of their visits to George; but, being
little curious of other people's affairs, and having no intrigues or
mysteries of his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) own, George was quite slow to imagine them in
other people. What mattered to him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) how often Kensington entertained
Bloomsbury, or Bloomsbury made its bow at Kensington?

<p/>A number of things were happening at both places, of which our Virginian
had not the slightest idea. Indeed, do not things happen under our eyes,
and we not see them? Are not comedies and tragedies daily performed
before us of which we understand neither the fun nor the pathos? Very
likely George goes home thinking to himself, <div class="bookquote">``I have made an impression
on the heart of this young creature. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) has almost confessed as much.
Poor artless little maiden! I wonder what there is in me that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) should
like me?''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>Can he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) be angry with her (<font color='blue'><b>people</b></font>) for this unlucky preference? Was ever
a man angry at such a reason? He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would not have been so well pleased,
perhaps, had he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) known all; and that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was only one of the performers
in the comedy, not the principal character by any means; Rosencrantz and
Guildenstern in the Tragedy, the part of Hamlet by a gentleman unknown.
How often are our little vanities shocked in this way, and subjected to
wholesome humiliation! Have you not fancied that Lucinda's eyes beamed
on you with a special tenderness, and presently become aware that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucinda</b></font>)
ogles your neighbour with the very same killing glances? Have you not
exchanged exquisite whispers with Lalage at the dinner-table -LRB-sweet
murmurs heard through the hum of the guests, and clatter of the
banquet!-RRB- and then overheard her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucinda</b></font>) whispering the very same delicious
phrases to old Surdus in the drawing-room? The sun shines for everybody;
the flowers smell sweet for all noses; and the nightingale and Lalage
warble for all ears--not your long ones only, good Brother!




<p/>CHAPTER LXX. In which Cupid plays a Considerable Part


<p/>We must now, however, and before we proceed with the history of Miss
Lydia and her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) doings, perform the duty of explaining that sentence
in Mr. Warrington's letter to his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) brother which refers to Lady Maria
Esmond, and which, to some simple readers, may be still mysterious.
For how, indeed, could well-regulated persons divine such a secret?
How could innocent and respectable young people suppose that a woman of
noble birth, of ancient family, of mature experience,--a woman whom we
have seen exceedingly in love only a score of months ago,--should so
far forget herself as -LRB-oh, my very finger-tips blush as I write the
sentence!-RRB---as not only to fall in love with a person of low origin, and
very many years her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) junior, but actually to marry him (<font color='blue'><b>junior</b></font>) in the face of
the world? That is, not exactly in the face, but behind the back of the
world, so to speak; for Parson Sampson privily tied the indissoluble
knot for the pair at his (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) chapel in Mayfair.

<p/>Now stop before you condemn her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) utterly. Because Lady Maria had had, and
overcome, a foolish partiality for her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) young cousin, was that any reason
why she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) should never fall in love with anybody else? Are men to have
the sole privilege of change, and are women to be rebuked for availing
themselves now and again of their little chance of consolation? No
invectives can be more rude, gross, and unphilosophical than, for
instance, Hamlet's to his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) mother about her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) second marriage. The truth,
very likely, is, that that tender, parasitic creature wanted a something
to cling to, and, Hamlet senior out of the way, twined herself round
Claudius. Nay, we have known females so bent on attaching themselves,
that they can twine round two gentlemen at once. Why, forsooth, shall
there not be marriage-tables after funeral baked-meats? If you said
grace for your feast yesterday, is that any reason why you shall not be
hungry to-day? Your natural fine appetite and relish for this evening's
feast, shows that to-morrow evening at eight o’clock you will most
probably be in want of your dinner. I, for my part, when Flirtilla or
Jiltissa were partial to me -LRB-the kind reader will please to fancy that
I am alluding here to persons of the most ravishing beauty and lofty
rank-RRB-, always used to bear in mind that a time would come when they
would be fond of somebody else. We are served a la Russe, and gobbled up
a dish at a time, like the folks in Polyphemus's cave. `Tis hodie mihi,
cras tibi: there are some Anthropophagi who devour dozens of us, the
old, the young, the tender, the tough, the plump, the lean, the ugly,
the beautiful: there's no escape, and one after another, as our fate is,
we disappear down their omnivorous maws. Look at Lady Ogresham! We all
remember, last year, how she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) served poor Tom Kydd: seized upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>),
devoured him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>), picked his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) bones, and flung them away. Now it is Ned
Suckling she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) has got into her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) den. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) lies under her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) great eyes,
quivering and fascinated. Look at the poor little trepid creature,
panting and helpless under the great eyes! She (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) trails towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) nearer
and nearer; he (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) draws to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>), closer and closer. Presently there will
be one or two feeble squeaks for pity, and--hobblegobble--he (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) will
disappear! Ah me! it is pity, too. I knew, for instance, that Maria
Esmond had lost her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) heart ever so many times before Harry Warrington
found it; but I like to fancy that he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) was going to keep it; that,
bewailing mischance and times out of joint, she (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) would yet have preserved
her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) love, and fondled it in decorous celibacy. If, in some paroxysm of
senile folly, I should fall in love to-morrow, I shall still try and
think I have acquired the fee-simple of my charmer's heart;--not that
I am only a tenant, on a short lease, of an old battered furnished
apartment, where the dingy old wine-glasses have been clouded by scores
of pairs of lips, and the tumbled old sofas are muddy with the last
lodger's boots. Dear, dear nymph! Being beloved and beautiful! Suppose I
had a little passing passion for Glycera -LRB-and her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) complexion really
was as pure as splendent Parian marble-RRB-; suppose you had a fancy for
Telephus, and his (<font color='blue'><b>charmer</b></font>) low collars and absurd neck;--those follies are all
over now, aren't they? We love each other for good now, don't we? Yes,
for ever; and Glycera may go to Bath, and Telephus take his (<font color='blue'><b>charmer</b></font>) cervicem
roseam to Jack Ketch, n’est-ce pas?

<p/>No. We never think of changing, my dear. However winds blow, or time
flies, or spoons stir, our potage, which is now so piping hot, will
never get cold. Passing fancies we may have allowed ourselves in former
days; and really your infatuation for Telephus -LRB-don't frown so, my
darling creature! and make the wrinkles in your forehead worse-RRB---I
say, really it was the talk of the whole town; and as for Glycera, she (<font color='blue'><b>creature</b></font>)
behaved confoundedly ill to me. Well, well, now that we understand each
other, it is for ever that our hearts are united, and we can look at Sir
Cresswell Cresswell, and snap our fingers at his (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) wig. But this Maria of
the last century was a woman of an ill-regulated mind. You, my love, who
know the world, know that in the course of this lady's career a great
deal must have passed that would not bear the light, or edify in the
telling. You know -LRB-not, my dear creature, that I mean you have any
experience; but you have heard people say--you have heard your mother
say-RRB- that an old flirt, when she (<font color='blue'><b>flirt</b></font>) has done playing the fool with
one passion, will play the fool with another; that flirting is like
drinking; and the brandy being drunk up, you--no, not you--Glycera--the
brandy being drunk up, Glycera, who has taken to drinking, will fall
upon the gin. So, if Maria Esmond has found a successor for Harry
Warrington, and set up a new sultan in the precious empire of her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) heart,
what, after all, could you expect from her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>)? That territory was like
the Low Countries, accustomed to being conquered, and for ever open to
invasion.

<p/>And Maria's present enslaver was no other than Mr. Geoghegan or Hagan,
the young actor who had performed in George's tragedy. His (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) tones were so
thrilling, his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) eye so bright, his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) mien so noble, he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) looked so beautiful
in his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) gilt leather armour and large buckled periwig, giving utterance
to the poet's glowing verses, that the lady's heart was yielded up to
him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>), even as Ariadne's to Bacchus when her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) affair with Theseus was over.
The young Irishman was not a little touched and elated by the highborn
damsel's partiality for him (<font color='blue'><b>Irishman</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Irishman</b></font>) might have preferred a Lady Maria
Hagan more tender in years, but one more tender in disposition it were
difficult to discover. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hagan</b></font>) clung to him (<font color='blue'><b>Irishman</b></font>) closely, indeed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hagan</b></font>) retired to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Irishman</b></font>) humble lodgings in Westminster with him (<font color='blue'><b>Irishman</b></font>), when it became necessary to
disclose their marriage, and when her (<font color='blue'><b>Hagan</b></font>) furious relatives disowned her (<font color='blue'><b>Hagan</b></font>).

<p/>General Lambert brought the news home from his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) office in Whitehall one
day, and made merry over it with his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) family. In those homely times a
joke was none the worse for being a little broad; and a fine lady would
laugh at a jolly page of Fielding, and weep over a letter of Clarissa,
which would make your present ladyship's eyes start out of your head
with horror. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fielding</b></font>) uttered all sorts of waggeries, did the merry General,
upon the subject of this marriage; upon George's share in bringing it
about; upon Barry's jealousy when he (<font color='blue'><b>Barry</b></font>) should hear of it, He (<font color='blue'><b>Barry</b></font>) vowed it was
cruel that cousin Hagan had not selected George as groomsman; that the
first child should be called Carpezan or Sybilla, after the tragedy, and
so forth. They would not quite be able to keep a coach, but they might
get a chariot and pasteboard dragons from Mr. Rich's theatre. The baby
might be christened in Macbeth's caldron; and Harry and harlequin ought
certainly to be godfathers.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why shouldn't she (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) marry him (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) if she (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) likes him (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hetty/Miss Hetty/Lambert</b></font>)</div>asked little Hetty. <div class="bookquote">``Why
should he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) not love her (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) because she (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) is a little old? Mamma is a little
old, and you love her (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) none the worse. When you married my mamma, sir, I
have heard you say you were very poor; and yet you were very happy, and
nobody laughed at you!''  (<font color='red'><b>this person</b></font>)</div>Thus this impudent little person spoke by reason
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) tender age, not being aware of Lady Maria Esmond's previous
follies.

<p/>So her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) family has deserted her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>)? George described what wrath they were
in; how Lady Castlewood had gone into mourning; how Mr. Will swore he (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>)
would have the rascal's ears; how furious Madame de Bernstein was, the
most angry of all. <div class="bookquote">``It is an insult to the family,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>says haughty little
Miss Hett; <div class="bookquote">``and I can fancy how ladies of that rank must be indignant at
their relative's marriage with a person of Mr. Hagan's condition; but to
desert her (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) is a very different matter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed, my dear child,''  (<font color='red'><b>mamma</b></font>)</div>cries mamma, <div class="bookquote">``you are talking of what you don't
understand. After my Lady Maria's conduct, no respectable person can go
to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>mamma</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What conduct, mamma?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never mind,''  (<font color='red'><b>mamma</b></font>)</div>cries mamma. <div class="bookquote">``Little girls can't be expected to know, and
ought not to be too curious to inquire, what Lady Maria's conduct has
been! Suffice it, miss, that I am shocked her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) ladyship should ever have
been here; and I say again, no honest person should associate with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then, Aunt Lambert, I must be whipped and sent to bed,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>says George,
with mock gravity. <div class="bookquote">``I own to you -LRB-though I did not confess sooner,
seeing that the affair was not mine-RRB- that I have been to see my cousin
the player, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) ladyship his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) wife. I found them in very dirty
lodgings in Westminster, where the wretch has the shabbiness to keep not
only his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) wife, but his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) old mother, and a little brother, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) puts
to school. I found Mr. Hagan, and came away with a liking, and almost a
respect for him (<font color='blue'><b>Hagan</b></font>), although I own he (<font color='blue'><b>Hagan</b></font>) has made a very improvident marriage.
But how improvident some folks are about marriage, aren't they, Theo?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Improvident, if they marry such spendthrifts as you,''  (<font color='red'><b>the General</b></font>)</div>says the General.
<div class="bookquote">``Master George found his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) relations, and I'll be bound to say he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) left his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
purse behind him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, not the purse, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>says George, smiling very tenderly. <div class="bookquote">``Theo made
that. But I am bound to own it came empty away. Mr. Rich is in great
dudgeon. He (<font color='blue'><b>Rich</b></font>) says he (<font color='blue'><b>Rich</b></font>) hardly dares have Hagan on his (<font color='blue'><b>Rich</b></font>) stage, and is afraid
of a riot, such as Mr. Garrick had about the foreign dancers. This is to
be a fine gentleman's riot. The macaronis are furious, and vow they will
pelt Mr. Hagan, and have him (<font color='blue'><b>Hagan</b></font>) cudgelled afterwards. My cousin Will, at
Arthur's, has taken his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) oath he (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) will have the actor's ears. Meanwhile,
as the poor man does not play, they have cut off his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) salary; and without
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) salary, this luckless pair of lovers have no means to buy bread and
cheese.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you took it to them, sir? It was like you, George!''  (<font color='red'><b>Theo/Lady Theo</b></font>)</div>says Theo,
worshipping him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) with her (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It was your purse took it, dear Theo!''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>replies George.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mamma, I hope you will go and see them to-morrow!''  (<font color='red'><b>Theo</b></font>)</div>prays Theo.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) doesn't, I shall get a divorce, my dear!''  (<font color='red'><b>papa</b></font>)</div>cries papa. <div class="bookquote">``Come and
kiss me, you little wench--that is, avec la bonne permission de monsieur
mon beau-fils.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Monsieur mon beau fiddlestick, papa!''  (<font color='red'><b>Hetty/Miss Hetty/Lambert</b></font>)</div>says Miss Lambert, and I have
no doubt complies with the paternal orders. And this was the first time
George Esmond Warrington, Esquire, was ever called a fiddlestick.

<p/>Any man, even in our time, who makes an imprudent marriage, knows how he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
has to run the gauntlet of the family, and undergo the abuse, the scorn,
the wrath, the pity of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) relations. If your respectable family cry out
because you marry the curate's daughter, one in ten, let us say, of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
charming children; or because you engage yourself to the young barrister
whose only present pecuniary resources come from the court which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
reports, and who will have to pay his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) Oxford bills out of your slender
little fortune;--if your friends cry out for making such engagements as
these, fancy the feelings of Lady Maria Hagan's friends, and even those
of Mr. Hagan's, on the announcement of this marriage.

<p/>There is old Mrs. Hagan, in the first instance. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Hagan</b></font>) son has kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Hagan</b></font>)
dutifully and in tolerable comfort, ever since he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) left Trinity College
at his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) father's death, and appeared as Romeo at Crow Street Theatre. His (<font color='blue'><b>Romeo</b></font>)
salary has sufficed of late years to keep the brother at school, to help
the sister who has gone out as companion, and to provide fire, clothing,
tea, dinner, and comfort for the old clergyman's widow. And now,
forsooth, a fine lady, with all sorts of extravagant habits, must come
and take possession of the humble home, and share the scanty loaf and
mutton! Were Hagan not a high-spirited fellow, and the old mother very
much afraid of him (<font color='blue'><b>Hagan</b></font>), I doubt whether my lady's life at the Westminster
lodgings would be very comfortable. It was very selfish perhaps to take
a place at that small table, and in poor Hagan's narrow bed. But Love in
some passionate and romantic dispositions never regards consequences, or
measures accommodation. Who has not experienced that frame of mind; what
thrifty wife has not seen and lamented her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) husband in that condition;
when, with rather a heightened colour and a deuce-may-care smile on his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
face, he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) comes home and announces that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) has asked twenty people to
dinner next Saturday? He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) doesn't know whom exactly; and he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) does know
the dining-room will only hold sixteen. Never mind! Two of the prettiest
girls can sit upon young gentlemen's knees: others won't come: there's
sure to be plenty! In the intoxication of love people venture upon this
dangerous sort of housekeeping; they don't calculate the resources of
their dining-table, or those inevitable butchers' and fishmongers' bills
which will be brought to the ghastly housekeeper at the beginning of the
month.

<p/>Yes: it was rather selfish of my Lady Maria to seat herself at Hagan's
table and take the cream off the milk, and the wings of the chickens,
and the best half of everything where there was only enough before; and
no wonder the poor old mamma-in-law was disposed to grumble. But what
was her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) outcry compared to the clamour at Kensington among Lady Maria's
noble family? Think of the talk and scandal all over the town! Think of
the titters and whispers of the ladies in attendance at the Princess's
court, where Lady Fanny had a place; of the jokes of Mr. Will's
brother-officers at the usher's table; of the waggeries in the daily
prints and magazines; of the comments of outraged prudes; of the
laughter of the clubs and the sneers of the ungodly! At the receipt of
the news Madame Bernstein had fits and ran off to the solitude of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
dear rocks at Tunbridge Wells, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) did not see above forty people
of a night at cards. My lord refused to see his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) sister; and the Countess
in mourning, as we have said, waited upon one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) patronesses, a
gracious Princess, who was pleased to condole with her (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) upon the disgrace
and calamity which had befallen her (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) house. For one, two, three whole
days the town was excited and amused by the scandal; then there came
other news--a victory in Germany; doubtful accounts from America; a
general officer coming home to take his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) trial; an exquisite new soprano
singer from Italy; and the public forgot Lady Maria in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) garret,
eating the hard-earned meal of the actor's family.

<p/>This is an extract from Mr. George Warrington's letter to his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) brother,
in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) describes other personal matters, as well as a visit he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) had
paid to the newly married pair:--


<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dearest little Theo,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) writes, ``was eager to accompany her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mamma
upon this errand of charity; but I thought Aunt Lambert's visit would be
best under the circumstances, and without the attendance of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) little
spinster aide-de-camp. Cousin Hagan was out when we called; we found
her (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) ladyship in a loose undress, and with her (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) hair in not the neatest
papers, playing at cribbage with a neighbour from the second floor,
while good Mrs. Hagan sate on the other side of the fire with a glass of
punch, and the Whole Duty of Man.

<p/>``Maria, your Maria once, cried a little when she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) saw us; and Aunt
Lambert, you may be sure, was ready with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) sympathy. While she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>)
bestowed it on Lady Maria, I paid the best compliments I could invent to
the old lady. When the conversation between Aunt L. and the bride began
to flag, I turned to the latter, and between us we did our best to make
a dreary interview pleasant. Our talk was about you, about Wolfe, about
war; you must be engaged face to face with the Frenchmen by this time,
and God send my dearest brother safe and victorious out of the battle!
Be sure we follow your steps anxiously--we fancy you at Cape Breton.
We have plans of Quebec, and charts of the St. Lawrence. Shall I ever
forget your face of joy that day when you saw me return safe and sound
from the little combat with the little Frenchman? So will my Harry, I
know, return from his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) battle. I feel quite assured of it; elated somehow
with the prospect of your certain success and safety. And I have made
all here share my cheerfulness. We talk of the campaign as over, and
Captain Warrington's promotion as secure. Pray Heaven, all our hopes may
be fulfilled one day ere long.

<p/>``How strange it is that you who are the mettlesome fellow -LRB-you know you
are-RRB- should escape quarrels hitherto, and I, who am a peaceful youth,
wishing no harm to anybody, should have battles thrust upon me! What do
you think actually of my having had another affair upon my wicked hands,
and with whom, think you? With no less a personage than your old enemy,
our kinsman, Mr. Will.

<p/>``What or who set him (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) to quarrel with me, I cannot think. Spencer
-LRB-who acted as second for me, for matters actually have gone this
length;--don't be frightened; it is all over, and nobody is a scratch
the worse-RRB- thinks some one set Will on me, but who, I say? His (<font color='blue'><b>Spencer</b></font>) conduct
has been most singular; his (<font color='blue'><b>Spencer</b></font>) behaviour quite unbearable. We have met
pretty frequently lately at the house of good Mr. Van den Bosch, whose
pretty granddaughter was consigned to both of us by our good mother. Oh,
dear mother! did you know that the little thing was to be such a
causa belli, and to cause swords to be drawn, and precious lives to
be menaced? But so it has been. To show his (<font color='blue'><b>Bosch</b></font>) own spirit, I suppose, or
having some reasonable doubt about mine, whenever Will and I have met
at Mynheer's house--and he (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) is for ever going there--he (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) has shown such
downright rudeness to me, that I have required more than ordinary
patience to keep my temper. He (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) has contradicted me once, twice, thrice
in the presence of the family, and out of sheer spite and rage, as
it appeared to me. Is he (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) paying his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) addresses to Miss Lydia, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>)
father's ships, negroes, and forty thousand pounds? I should guess so.
The old gentleman is for ever talking about his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) money, and adores his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
granddaughter, and as she (<font color='blue'><b>granddaughter</b></font>) is a beautiful little creature, numbers of
folk here are ready to adore her (<font color='blue'><b>granddaughter</b></font>) too. Was Will rascal enough to fancy
that I would give up my Theo for a million of guineas, and negroes, and
Venus to boot? Could the thought of such baseness enter into the man's
mind? I don't know that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has accused me of stealing Van den Bosch's
spoons and tankards when we dine there, or of robbing on the highway.
But for one reason or the other he (<font color='blue'><b>Bosch</b></font>) has chosen to be jealous of me,
and as I have parried his (<font color='blue'><b>Bosch</b></font>) impertinences with little sarcastic speeches
-LRB-though perfectly civil before company-RRB-, perhaps I have once or twice
made him (<font color='blue'><b>Bosch</b></font>) angry. Our little Miss Lydia has unwittingly added fuel to the
fire on more than one occasion, especially yesterday, when there was
talk about your worship.

<p/>```Ah!' says the heedless little thing, as we sat over our dessert, `'tis
lucky for you, Mr. Esmond, that Captain Harry is not here.'

<p/>```Why, miss?' asks he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), with one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) usual conversational ornaments.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) must have offended some fairy in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) youth, who has caused him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) to
drop curses for ever out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) mouth, as she (<font color='blue'><b>fairy</b></font>) did the girl to spit out
toads and serpents. -LRB-I know some one from whose gentle lips there only
fall pure pearls and diamonds.-RRB- `Why?' says Will, with a cannonade of
oaths.

<p/>```O fie!' says she (<font color='blue'><b>fairy</b></font>), putting up the prettiest little fingers to the
prettiest little rosy ears in the world. `O fie, sir! to use such
naughty words. `Tis lucky the Captain is not here, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) might
quarrel with you; and Mr. George is so peaceable and quiet, that he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
won't. Have you heard from the Captain, Mr. George?'

<p/>```From Cape Breton,' says I. `He (<font color='blue'><b>Breton</b></font>) is very well, thank you; that is--'
I couldn't finish the sentence, for I was in such a rage that I scarce
could contain myself.

<p/>```From the Captain, as you call him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>), Miss Lyddy,' says Will. `He (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>)'ll
distinguish himself as he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) did at Saint Cas! Ho, ho!'

<p/>```So I apprehend he (<font color='blue'><b>Ho</b></font>) did, sir,' says Will's brother.

<p/>```Did he (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>)?' says our dear cousin; `always thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) ran away; took to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) legs; got a ducking, and ran away as if a bailiff was after him (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>).'

<p/>```La!' says Miss, `did the Captain ever have a bailiff after him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>)?'

<p/>```Didn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>)? Ho, ho!' laughs Mr. Will.

<p/>``I suppose I must have looked very savage, for Spencer, who was dining
with us, trod on my foot under the table. `Don't laugh so loud, cousin,'
I said, very gently; `you may wake good old Mr. Van den Bosch.' The good
old gentleman was asleep in his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) arm-chair, to which he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) commonly retires
for a nap after dinner.

<p/>```Oh, indeed, cousin,' says Will, and he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) turns and winks at a friend of
his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>), Captain Deuceace, whose own and whose wife's reputation I dare say
you heard of when you frequented the clubs, and whom Will has introduced
into this simple family as a man of the highest fashion. `Don't be
afraid, miss,' says Mr. Will, `nor my cousin needn't be.'

<p/>```Oh, what a comfort!' cries Miss Lyddy. `Keep quite quiet, gentlemen,
and don't quarrel, and come up to me when I send to say the tea is
ready.' And with this she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) makes a sweet little curtsey, and disappears.

<p/>```Hang it, Jack, pass the bottle, and don't wake the old gentleman!'
continues Mr. Will. `Won't you help yourself, cousin?' he (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) continues;
being particularly facetious in the tone of that word cousin.

<p/>```I am going to help myself,' I said; `but I am not going to drink the
glass; and I'll tell you what I am going to do with it, if you will be
quite quiet, cousin.' -LRB-Desperate kicks from Spencer all this time.-RRB-

<p/>```And what the deuce do I care what you are going to do with it?' asks
Will, looking rather white.

<p/>```I am going to fling it into your face, cousin,' says I, very rapidly
performing that feat.

<p/>```By Jove, and no mistake!' cries Mr. Deuceace; and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) and William
roared out an oath together, good old Van den Bosch woke up, and, taking
the pocket-handkerchief off his (<font color='blue'><b>Bosch</b></font>) face, asked what was the matter.

<p/>``I remarked it was only a glass of wine gone the wrong way and the
old man said; `Well, well, there is more where that came from! Let the
butler bring you what you please, young gentlemen!' and he (<font color='blue'><b>butler</b></font>) sank back in
his (<font color='blue'><b>butler</b></font>) great chair, and began to sleep again.

<p/>```From the back of Montagu House Gardens there is a beautiful view of
Hampstead at six o’clock in the morning; and the statue of the King on
St. George's Church is reckoned elegant, cousin!' says I, resuming the
conversation.

<p/>```D-- the statue!' begins Will; but I said, `Don't, cousin! or you
will wake up the old gentleman. Had we not best go upstairs to Miss
Lyddy's tea-table?'

<p/>``We arranged a little meeting for the next morning; and a coroner
might have been sitting upon one or other, or both, of our bodies this
afternoon; but, would you believe it? just as our engagement was about
to take place, we were interrupted by three of Sir John Fielding's men,
and carried to Bow Street, and ignominiously bound over to keep the
peace.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who gave the information? Not I, or Spencer, I can vow. Though I own
I was pleased when the constables came running to us; bludgeon in hand:
for I had no wish to take Will's blood, or sacrifice my own to such a
rascal. Now, sir, have you such a battle as this to describe to me?--a
battle of powder and no shot?--a battle of swords as bloody as any on
the stage? I have filled my paper, without finishing the story of Maria
and her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) Hagan. You must have it by the next ship. You see, the quarrel
with Will took place yesterday, very soon after I had written the first
sentence or two of my letter. I had been dawdling till dinner-time -LRB-I
looked at the paper last night, when I was grimly making certain little
accounts up, and wondered shall I ever finish this letter?-RRB-, and now
the quarrel has been so much more interesting to me than poor Molly's
love-adventures, that behold my paper is full to the brim! Wherever my
dearest Harry reads it, I know that there will be a heart full of love
for--His (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) loving brother, G. E. W.''




 (<font color='red'><b>White</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER LXXI. White Favours


<p/>The little quarrel between George and his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) cousin caused the former to
discontinue his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) visits to Bloomsbury in a great measure; for Mr. Will
was more than ever assiduous in his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) attentions; and, now that both were
bound over to peace, so outrageous in his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) behaviour, that George found
the greatest difficulty in keeping his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) hands from his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) cousin. The
artless little Lydia had certainly a queer way of receiving her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) friends.
But six weeks before madly jealous of George's preference for another,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) now took occasion repeatedly to compliment Theo in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) conversation.
Miss Theo was such a quiet, gentle creature, Lyddy was sure George was
just the husband for her (<font color='blue'><b>Lyddy</b></font>). How fortunate that horrible quarrel had been
prevented! The constables had come up just in time; and it was quite
ridiculous to hear Mr. Esmond cursing and swearing, and the rage he (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) was
in at being disappointed of his (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) duel! <div class="bookquote">``But the arrival of the constables
saved your valuable life, dear Mr. George, and I am sure Miss Theo ought
to bless them forever,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lyddy/Miss Lyddy</b></font>)</div>says Lyddy, with a soft smile. <div class="bookquote">``You won't
stop and meet Mr. Esmond at dinner to-day? You don't like being in his (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>)
company? He (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) can't do you any harm; and I am sure you will do him (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) none.''
 (<font color='red'><b>a girl</b></font>)</div>Kind speeches like these addressed by a little girl to a gentleman, and
spoken by a strange inadvertency in company, and when other gentlemen
and ladies were present, were not likely to render Mr. Warrington very
eager for the society of the young American lady.

<p/>George's meeting with Mr. Will was not known for some days in Dean
Street, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Dean</b></font>) did not wish to disturb those kind folks with his (<font color='blue'><b>Dean</b></font>)
quarrel; but when the ladies were made aware of it, you may be sure
there was a great flurry and to-do. <div class="bookquote">``You were actually going to take a
fellow-creature's life, and you came to see us, and said not a word! Oh,
George, it was shocking!''  (<font color='red'><b>Theo/Lady Theo</b></font>)</div>said Theo.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear, he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) had insulted me and my brother,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>pleaded George. <div class="bookquote">``Could I
let him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) call us both cowards, and sit by and say, Thank you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>The General</b></font>)</div><p/>The General sate by and looked very grave.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You know you think, papa, it is a wicked and un-Christian practice; and
have often said you wished gentlemen would have the courage to refuse!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To refuse? Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lambert</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Lambert, still very glum.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It must require a prodigious strength of mind to refuse,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jack Lambert</b></font>)</div>says Jack
Lambert, looking as gloomy as his (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) father; <div class="bookquote">``and I think if any man were
to call me a coward, I should be apt to forget my orders.''

 (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You see brother Jack is with me!''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>cries George.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I must not be against you, Mr. Warrington,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jack Lambert</b></font>)</div>says Jack Lambert.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Warrington!''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>cries George, turning very red.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Would you, a clergyman, have George break the Commandments, and commit
murder, John?''  (<font color='red'><b>Theo</b></font>)</div>asks Theo, aghast.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am a soldier's son, sister,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>says the young divine, drily. <div class="bookquote">``Besides,
Mr. Warrington has committed no murder at all. We must soon be hearing
from Canada, father. The great question of the supremacy of the two
races must be tried there ere long!''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) turned his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) back on George as he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
spoke, and the latter eyed him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) with wonder.

<p/>Hetty, looking rather pale at this original remark of brother Jack,
is called out of the room by some artful pretext of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) sister. George
started up and followed the retreating girls to the door.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Great powers, gentlemen!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>says he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>), coming back, <div class="bookquote">``I believe, on my
honour, you are giving me the credit of shirking this affair with Mr.
Esmond!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>The clergyman and his (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) father looked at one another.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A man's nearest and dearest are always the first to insult him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>says
George, flashing out.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You mean to say, `Not guilty?' God bless thee, my boy!''  (<font color='red'><b>the General</b></font>)</div>cries the
General. <div class="bookquote">``I told thee so, Jack.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) rubbed his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) hand across his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) eyes,
and blushed, and wrung George's hand with all his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) might.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not guilty of what, in heaven's name?''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>asks Mr. Warrington.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay,''  (<font color='red'><b>the General Jack</b></font>)</div>said the General, <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Jack, here, brought the story. Let him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>)
tell it. I believe `tis a ------ lie, with all my heart.''  (<font color='red'><b>the General Jack</b></font>)</div>And uttering
this wicked expression, the General fairly walked out of the room.

<p/>The Rev. J. Lambert looked uncommonly foolish.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And what is this--this d--d lie, sir, that somebody has been telling
of me?''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>asked George, grinning at the young clergyman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``To question the courage of any man is always an offence to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lambert</b></font>)</div>says
Mr. Lambert, <div class="bookquote">``and I rejoice that yours has been belied.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lambert</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who told the falsehood, sir, which you repeated?''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>bawls out Mr.
Warrington. <div class="bookquote">``I insist on the man's name!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You forget you are bound over to keep the peace,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Morris/Mr. Morris</b></font>)</div>says Jack.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Curse the peace, sir! We can go and fight in Holland. Tell me the man's
name, I say!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Fair and softly, Mr. Warrington!''  (<font color='red'><b>the parson</b></font>)</div>cries the young parson; <div class="bookquote">``my hearing

confess, I imparted to my father.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the parson</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What?''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>asks George, the truth suddenly occurring. <div class="bookquote">``Was it that artful,

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Vixen is not the word to apply to any young lady, George Warrington!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hetty/Miss Hetty/Lambert</b></font>)</div>exclaims Lambert, <div class="bookquote">``much less to the charming Miss Lydia. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) artful--the
most innocent of Heaven's creatures! She (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) wicked--that angel! With
unfeigned delight that the quarrel should be over--with devout gratitude
to think that blood consanguineous should not be shed--she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) spoke in
terms of the highest praise of you for declining this quarrel, and of
the deepest sympathy with you for taking the painful but only method of
averting it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hetty/Miss Hetty/Lambert</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What method?''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>demands George, stamping his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) foot.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, of laying an information, to be sure!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Morris/Mr. Morris</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Jack; on which
George burst forth into language much too violent for us to repeat here,
and highly uncomplimentary to Miss Lydia.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't utter such words, sir!''  (<font color='red'><b>the parson</b></font>)</div>cried the parson, who, as it seemed,
now took his (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) turn to be angry. <div class="bookquote">``Do not insult, in my hearing, the most
charming, the most innocent of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) sex! If she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) has been mistaken in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>)
information regarding you, and doubted your willingness to commit what,
after all, is a crime--for a crime homicide is, and of the most awful
description--you, sir, have no right to blacken that angel's character
with foul words: and, innocent yourself, should respect the most
innocent as she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) is the most lovely of women! Oh, George, are you to be
my brother?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope to have that honour,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>answered George, smiling. He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) began to
perceive the other's drift.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What, then, what--though `tis too much bliss to be hoped for by sinful
man--what, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) should one day be your sister? Who could see her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>)

that those Latin Sapphics in the September number of the Gentleman's
Magazine, beginning Lydicae quondam cecinit venustae -LRB-with an English
version by my friend Hickson of Corpus-RRB-, were mine. I have told my
mother what hath passed between us, and Mrs. Lambert also thinks that
the most lovely of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) sex has deigned to look favourably on me. I have
composed a letter--she (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) another. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) proposes to wait on Miss Lydia's
grandpapa this very day, and to bring me the answer, which shall make
me the happiest or the most wretched of men! It was in the unrestrained
intercourse of family conversation that I chanced to impart to my
father the sentiments which my dear girl had uttered. Perhaps I spoke
slightingly of your courage, which I don't doubt--by Heaven, I don't
doubt: it may be, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) has erred, too, regarding you. It may be that
the fiend jealousy has been gnawing at my bosom, and--horrible
suspicion!--that I thought my sister's lover found too much favour with

an end to the war, and no fighting out of the profession!''

 (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div><p/>George pleaded an engagement, as a reason for running away early from
his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) dinner; and Jack must have speedily followed him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>), for when the
former, after transacting some brief business at his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) own lodgings, came
to Mr. Van den Bosch's door, in Bloomsbury Square, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bosch</b></font>) found the young
parson already in parley with a servant there. <div class="bookquote">``His (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) master and mistress
had left town yesterday,''  (<font color='red'><b>the servant</b></font>)</div>the servant said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Poor Jack! And you had the decisive letter in your pocket?''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>George
asked of his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) future brother-in-law.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, yes,'' (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Morris/Mr. Morris</b></font>)</div>--Jack owned he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) had the document--<div class="bookquote">``and my mother has ordered
a chair, and was coming to wait on Miss Lyddy,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) whispered piteously,
as the young men lingered on the steps.

<p/>George had a note, too, in his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) pocket for the young lady, which he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) had
not cared to mention to Jack. In truth, his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) business at home had been to
write a smart note to Miss Lyddy, with a message for the gentleman who
had brought her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) that funny story of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) giving information regarding the
duel! The family being absent, George, too, did not choose to leave his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
note. <div class="bookquote">``If cousin Will has been the slander-bearer, I will go and make
him (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) recant,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>thought George. <div class="bookquote">``Will the family soon be back?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) blandly
asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They are gone to visit the quality,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>the servant replied. <div class="bookquote">``Here is the
address on this paper;''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>and George read, in Miss Lydia's hand, <div class="bookquote">``The box
from Madam Hocquet's to be sent by the Farnham Flying Coach; addressed
to Miss Van den Bosch, at the Right Honourable the Earl of Castlewood's,
Castlewood, Hants.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Lydia/Lydia</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Where?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Morris/Mr. Morris</b></font>)</div>cried poor Jack, aghast.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``His (<font color='blue'><b>Earl</b></font>) lordship and their ladyships have been here often,''  (<font color='red'><b>the servant</b></font>)</div>the servant
said, with much importance. <div class="bookquote">``The families is quite intimate.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>This was very strange; for, in the course of their conversation, Lyddy
had owned but to one single visit from Lady Castlewood.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And they must be a-going to stay there some time, for Miss have took
a power of boxes and gowns with her (<font color='blue'><b>Bosch</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>the man added. And the young men
walked away, each crumpling his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) letter in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pocket.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What was that remark you made?''  (<font color='red'><b>George</b></font>)</div>asks George of Jack, at some
exclamation of the latter. <div class="bookquote">``I think you said--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Distraction! I am beside myself, George! I--I scarce know what I am
saying,''  (<font color='red'><b>the clergyman</b></font>)</div>groans the clergyman. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Bosch</b></font>) is gone to Hampshire, and Mr. Esmond
is gone with her (<font color='blue'><b>Bosch</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Othello could not have spoken better! and she (<font color='blue'><b>Bosch</b></font>) has a pretty scoundrel
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Bosch</b></font>) company!''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>says Mr. George. <div class="bookquote">``Ha! here is your mother's chair!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Aunt</b></font>)</div>Indeed, at this moment poor Aunt Lambert came swinging down Great
Russell Street, preceded by her (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) footman. ```Tis no use going farther,
Aunt Lambert!'' cries George. <div class="bookquote">``Our little bird has flown.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What little bird?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The bird Jack wished to pair with:--the Lyddy bird, aunt. Why, Jack, I
protest you are swearing again! This morning `twas the Sixth Commandment
you wanted to break; and now--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Confound it! leave me alone, Mr. Warrington, do you hear?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Morris/Mr. Morris</b></font>)</div>growls Jack,
looking very savage; and away he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) strides far out of the reach of his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
mother's bearers.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is the matter, George?''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>asks the lady.

<p/>George, who has not been very well pleased with brother Jack's behaviour
all day, says: <div class="bookquote">``Brother Jack has not a fine temper, Aunt Lambert. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>)
informs you all that I am a coward, and remonstrates with me for being
angry. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) finds his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) mistress gone to the country, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) bawls, and
stamps, and swears. O fie! Oh, Aunt Lambert, beware of jealousy! Did the
General ever make you jealous?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Morris/Mr. Morris</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You will make me very angry if you speak to me in this way,''  (<font color='red'><b>Aunt</b></font>)</div>says poor
Aunt Lambert from her (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) chair.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am respectfully dumb. I make my bow. I withdraw,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>says George, with
a low bow, and turns towards Holborn. His (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) soul was wrath within him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>).
He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) was bent on quarrelling with somebody. Had he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) met cousin Will that
night, it had gone ill with his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) sureties.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) sought Will at all his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) haunts, at Arthur's, at his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) own house. There
Lady Castlewood's servants informed him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) that they believed Mr. Esmond
had gone to join the family in Hants. He (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) wrote a letter to his (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) cousin:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear, kind cousin William,''  (<font color='red'><b>cousin</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``you know I am bound over, and
would not quarrel with any one, much less with a dear, truth-telling,
affectionate kinsman, whom my brother insulted by caning. But if you can
find any one who says that I prevented a meeting the other day by giving
information, will you tell your informant that I think it is not I but
somebody else is the coward? And I write to Mr. Van den Bosch by the
same post, to inform him (<font color='blue'><b>Bosch</b></font>) and Miss Lyddy that I find some rascal has been
telling them lies to my discredit, and to beg them to have a care of
such persons.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And, these neat letters being despatched, Mr. Warrington
dressed himself, showed himself at the play, and took supper cheerfully
at the Bedford.

<p/>In a few days George found a letter on his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) breakfast-table franked
<div class="bookquote">``Castlewood,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>and, indeed, written by that nobleman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear Cousin,''  (<font color='red'><b>lord</b></font>)</div>my lord wrote, ``there has been so much annoyance in our
family of late, that I am sure `tis time our quarrels should cease. Two
days since my brother William brought me a very angry letter, signed G.
Warrington, and at the same time, to my great grief and pain, acquainted
me with a quarrel that had taken place between you, in which, to say
the least, your conduct was violent. `Tis an ill use to put good wine
to--that to which you applied good Mr. Van den Bosch's. Sure, before an
old man, young ones should be more respectful. I do not deny that Wm.'s
language and behaviour are often irritating. I know he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has often tried
my temper, and that within the 24 hours.

<p/>``Ah! why should we not all live happily together? You know, cousin,
I have ever professed a sincere regard for you--that I am a sincere
admirer of the admirable young lady to whom you are engaged, and to whom
I offer my most cordial compliments and remembrances. I would live in
harmony with all my family where `tis possible--the more because I hope
to introduce to it a Countess of Castlewood.

<p/>``At my mature age, `tis not uncommon for a man to choose a young wife.
My Lydia -LRB-you will divine that I am happy in being able to call mine the
elegant Miss Van den Bosch-RRB- will naturally survive me. After soothing
my declining years, I shall not be jealous if at their close she (<font color='blue'><b>Bosch</b></font>)
should select some happy man to succeed me; though I shall envy him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) the
possession of so much perfection and beauty. Though of a noble Dutch
family, her (<font color='blue'><b>Bosch</b></font>) rank, the dear girl declares, is not equal to mine, which
she (<font color='blue'><b>Bosch</b></font>) confesses that she (<font color='blue'><b>Bosch</b></font>) is pleased to share. I, on the other hand, shall
not be sorry to see descendants to my house, and to have it, through my
Lady Castlewood's means, restored to something of the splendour which it
knew before two or three improvident predecessors impaired it. My Lydia,
who is by my side, sends you and the charming Lambert family her (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) warmest
remembrances.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The marriage will take place very speedily here. May I hope to see you
at church? My brother will not be present to quarrel with you. When
I and dear Lydia announced the match to him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) yesterday, he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) took the
intelligence in bad part, uttered language that I know he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) will one day
regret, and is at present on a visit to some neighbours. The Dowager
Lady Castlewood retains the house at Kensington; we having our own
establishment, where you will ever be welcomed, dear cousin, by your
affectionate humble servant, CASTLEWOOD.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER LXXII. -LRB-From the Warrington MS.-RRB- In which My Lady is on the Top
of the Ladder


<p/>Looking across the fire, towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) accustomed chair, who has been the
beloved partner of my hearth during the last half of my life, I often
ask -LRB-for middle aged gentlemen have the privilege of repeating their
jokes, their questions, their stories-RRB- whether two young people ever
were more foolish and imprudent than we were when we married, as we
did, in the year of the old King's death? My son, who has taken some
prodigious leaps in the heat of his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) fox-hunting, says he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) surveys the
gaps and rivers which he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) crossed so safely over with terror afterwards,
and astonishment at his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) own foolhardiness in making such desperate
ventures; and yet there is no more eager sportsman in the two counties
than Miles. He (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) loves his (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) amusement so much that he (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) cares for no other.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) has broken his (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) collar-bone, and had a hundred tumbles -LRB-to his (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>)
mother's terror-RRB-; but so has his (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) father -LRB-thinking, perhaps, of a copy
of verse, or his (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) speech at Quarter Sessions-RRB- been thrown over his (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) old
mare's head, who has slipped on a stone as they were both dreaming along
a park road at four miles an hour; and Miles's reckless sport has been
the delight of his (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) life, as my marriage has been the blessing of mine;
and I never think of it but to thank Heaven. Mind, I don't set up my
worship as an example. I don't say to all young folks, <div class="bookquote">``Go and marry
upon twopence a year;''  (<font color='red'><b>all folks</b></font>)</div>or people would look very black at me at our
vestry-meetings; but my wife is known to be a desperate match-maker; and
when Hodge and Susan appear in my justice-room with a talk of allowance,
we urge them to spend their half-crown a week at home, add a little
contribution of our own, and send for the vicar.

<p/>Now, when I ask a question of my dear oracle, I know what the answer
will be; and hence, no doubt, the reason why I so often consult her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>). I
have but to wear a particular expression of face and my Diana takes her (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>)
reflection from it. Suppose I say, <div class="bookquote">``My dear, don't you think the moon
was made of cream cheese to-night?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) will say, <div class="bookquote">``Well, papa, it did
look very like cream cheese, indeed--there's nobody like you for droll
similes.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>Or, suppose I say, <div class="bookquote">``My love, Mr. Pitt's speech was very fine,
but I don't think he (<font color='blue'><b>Pitt</b></font>) is equal to what I remember his (<font color='blue'><b>Pitt</b></font>) father.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Nobody
was equal to my Lord Chatham,''  (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div>says my wife. And then one of the
girls cries, <div class="bookquote">``Why, I have often heard our papa say Lord Chatham was a
charlatan!''  (<font color='red'><b>the girls</b></font>)</div>On which mamma says, <div class="bookquote">``How like she (<font color='blue'><b>Pitt</b></font>) is to her (<font color='blue'><b>Pitt</b></font>) Aunt Hetty!''

 (<font color='red'><b>mamma</b></font>)</div><p/>As for Miles, Tros Tyriusve is all one to him (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) only reads the
sporting announcements in the Norwich paper. So long as there is good
scent, he (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) does not care about the state of the country. I believe the
rascal has never read my poems, much more my tragedies -LRB-for I mentioned
Pocahontas to him (<font color='blue'><b>rascal</b></font>) the other day, and the dunce thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Pocahontas</b></font>) was a river
in Virginia-RRB-; and with respect to my Latin verses, how can he (<font color='blue'><b>rascal</b></font>) understand
them when I know he (<font color='blue'><b>rascal</b></font>) can't construe Corderius? Why, this notebook lies
publicly on the little table at my corner of the fireside, and any one
may read in it who will take the trouble of lifting my spectacles off
the cover: but Miles never hath. I insert in the loose pages caricatures
of Miles: jokes against him (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>): but he (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) never knows nor heeds them. Only
once, in place of a neat drawing of mine, in China-ink, representing
Miles asleep after dinner, and which my friend Bunbury would not disown,
I found a rude picture of myself going over my mare Sultana's head, and
entitled <div class="bookquote">``The Squire on Horseback, or Fish out of Water.''  (<font color='red'><b>mare</b></font>)</div>And the fellow
to roar with laughter, and all the girls to titter, when I came upon the
page! My wife said she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) never was in such a fright as when I went to my
book: but I can bear a joke against myself, and have heard many, though
-LRB-strange to say, for one who has lived among some of the chief wits of
the age-RRB- I never heard a good one in my life. Never mind, Miles, though
thou art not a wit, I love thee none the worse -LRB-there never was any love
lost between two wits in a family-RRB-; though thou hast no great beauty,
thy mother thinks thee as handsome as Apollo, or his (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) Royal Highness the
Prince of Wales, who was born in the very same year with thee. Indeed,
she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) always think Coates's picture of the Prince is very like her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) eldest
boy, and has the print in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) dressing-room to this very day.


<p/>-LSB-Note, in a female hand: <div class="bookquote">``My son is not a spendthrift, nor a breaker of
women's hearts, as some gentlemen are; but that he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) was exceeding like
H.R.H. when they were both babies, is most certain, the Duchess of
Aneaster having herself remarked him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) in St. James's Park, where Gumbo
and my poor Molly used often to take him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) for an airing. Th. W.'' (<font color='red'><b>prospects</b></font>)</div>-RSB-


<p/>In that same year, with what different prospects! my Lord Esmond, Lord
Castlewood's son, likewise appeared to adorn the world. My Lord C. and
his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) humble servant had already come to a coolness at that time, and,
heaven knows! my honest Miles's godmother, at his (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) entrance into life,
brought no gold pap-boats to his (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) christening! Matters have mended since,
laus Deo--laus Deo, indeed! for I suspect neither Miles nor his (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) father
would ever have been able to do much for themselves, and by their own
wits.

<p/>Castlewood House has quite a different face now from that venerable
one which it wore in the days of my youth, when it was covered with the
wrinkles of time, the scars of old wars, the cracks and blemishes which
years had marked on its hoary features. I love best to remember it in
its old shape, as I saw it when young Mr. George Warrington went down
at the owner's invitation, to be present at his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) lordship's marriage with
Miss Lydia Van den Bosch--<div class="bookquote">``an American lady of noble family of Holland,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Lydia Van den Bosch</b></font>)</div>as the county paper announced her (<font color='blue'><b>Bosch</b></font>) ladyship to be. Then the towers stood
as Warrington's grandfather the Colonel -LRB-the Marquis, as Madam Esmond
would like to call her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) father-RRB- had seen them. The woods -LRB-thinned not
a little to be sure-RRB- stood, nay, some of the self-same rooks may have
cawed over them, which the Colonel had seen threescore years back. His (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>)
picture hung in the hall which might have been his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>), had he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) not preferred
love and gratitude to wealth and worldly honour; and Mr. George Esmond
Warrington -LRB-that is, Egomet Ipse who write this page down-RRB-, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>)
walked the old place, pacing the long corridors, the smooth dew-spangled
terraces and cool darkling avenues, felt a while as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) was one of Mr.
Walpole's cavaliers with ruff, rapier, buff-coat, and gorget, and as if
an Old Pretender, or a Jesuit emissary in disguise, might appear from
behind any tall tree-trunk round about the mansion, or antique carved
cupboard within it. I had the strangest, saddest, pleasantest, old-world
fancies as I walked the place; I imagined tragedies, intrigues,
serenades, escaladoes, Oliver's Roundheads battering the towers, or
bluff Hal's Beefeaters pricking over the plain before the castle. I was
then courting a certain young lady -LRB-madam, your ladyship's eyes had no
need of spectacles then, and on the brow above them there was never a
wrinkle or a silver hair-RRB-, and I remember I wrote a ream of romantic
description, under my Lord Castlewood's franks, to the lady who never
tired of reading my letters then. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) says I only send her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) three lines
now, when I am away in London or elsewhere. `Tis that I may not fatigue
your old eyes, my dear!

<p/>Mr. Warrington thought himself authorised to order a genteel new suit of
clothes for my lord's marriage, and with Mons. Gumbo in attendance,
made his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) appearance at Castlewood a few days before the ceremony. I may
mention that it had been found expedient to send my faithful Sady home
on board a Virginia ship. A great inflammation attacking the throat and
lungs, and proving fatal in very many cases, in that year of Wolfe's
expedition, had seized and well-nigh killed my poor lad, for whom
his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) native air was pronounced to be the best cure. We parted with an
abundance of tears, and Gumbo shed as many when his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) master went to
Quebec: but he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) had attractions in this country and none for the military
life, so he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) remained attached to my service. We found Castlewood House
full of friends, relations, and visitors. Lady Fanny was there upon
compulsion, a sulky bridesmaid. Some of the virgins of the neighbourhood
also attended the young Countess. A bishop's widow herself, the Baroness
Beatrix brought a holy brother-in-law of the bench from London to tie
the holy knot of matrimony between Eugene Earl of Castlewood and Lydia
Van den Bosch, spinster; and for some time before and after the nuptials
the old house in Hampshire wore an appearance of gaiety to which it had
long been unaccustomed. The country families came gladly to pay their
compliments to the newly married couple. The lady's wealth was the
subject of everybody's talk, and no doubt did not decrease in the
telling. Those naughty stories which were rife in town, and spread by
her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) disappointed suitors there, took some little time to travel into
Hampshire; and when they reached the country found it disposed to treat
Lord Castlewood's wife with civility, and not inclined to be too curious
about her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) behaviour in town. Suppose she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had jilted this man, and
laughed at the other? It was her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) money they were anxious about, and she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
was no more mercenary than they. The Hampshire folks were determined
that it was a great benefit to the country to have Castlewood House once
more open, with beer in the cellars, horses in the stables, and spits
turning before the kitchen fires. The new lady took her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) place with great
dignity, and `twas certain she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had uncommon accomplishments and wit.
Was it not written, in the marriage advertisements, that her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) ladyship
brought her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) noble husband seventy thousand pounds? On a beaucoup
d’esprit with seventy thousand pounds. The Hampshire people said this
was only a small portion of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) wealth. When the grandfather should
fall, ever so many plums would be found on that old tree.

<p/>That quiet old man, and keen reckoner, began quickly to put the
dilapidated Castlewood accounts in order, of which long neglect,
poverty, and improvidence had hastened the ruin. The business of the
old gentleman's life now, and for some time henceforth, was to
advance, improve, mend my lord's finances; to screw the rents up where
practicable, to pare the expenses of the establishment down. He (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) could,
somehow, look to every yard of worsted lace on the footmen's coats, and
every pound of beef that went to their dinner. A watchful old eye noted
every flagon of beer which was fetched from the buttery, and marked
that no waste occurred in the larder. The people were fewer, but more
regularly paid; the liveries were not so ragged, and yet the tailor had
no need to dun for his (<font color='blue'><b>tailor</b></font>) money; the gardeners and grooms grumbled, though
their wages were no longer overdue: but the horses fattened on less
corn, and the fruit and vegetables were ever so much more plentiful--so
keenly did my lady's old grandfather keep a watch over the household
affairs, from his (<font color='blue'><b>tailor</b></font>) lonely little chamber in the turret.

<p/>These improvements, though here told in a paragraph or two, were the
affairs of months and years at Castlewood; where, with thrift, order,
and judicious outlay of money -LRB-however, upon some pressing occasions,
my lord might say he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) had none-RRB-, the estate and household increased in
prosperity. That it was a flourishing and economical household no one
could deny: not even the dowager lady and her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) two children, who now
seldom entered within Castlewood gates, my lady considering them in the
light of enemies--for who, indeed, would like a stepmother-in-law? The
little reigning Countess gave the dowager battle, and routed her (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) utterly
and speedily. Though educated in the colonies, and ignorant of polite
life during her (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) early years, the Countess Lydia had a power of language
and a strength of will that all had to acknowledge who quarrelled with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>). The dowager and my Lady Fanny were no match for the young American:
they fled from before her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) to their jointure house in Kensington, and no
wonder their absence was not regretted by my lord, who was in the habit
of regretting no one whose back was turned. Could cousin Warrington,
whose hand his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) lordship pressed so affectionately on coming and parting,
with whom cousin Eugene was so gay and frank and pleasant when they
were together, expect or hope that his (<font color='blue'><b>Eugene</b></font>) lordship would grieve at his (<font color='blue'><b>Eugene</b></font>)
departure, at his (<font color='blue'><b>Eugene</b></font>) death, at any misfortune which could happen to him (<font color='blue'><b>Eugene</b></font>),
or any souls alive? Cousin Warrington knew better. Always of a sceptical
turn, Mr. W. took a grim delight in watching the peculiarities of his (<font color='blue'><b>W.</b></font>)
neighbours, and could like this one even though he (<font color='blue'><b>W.</b></font>) had no courage and no
heart. Courage? Heart? What are these to you and me in the world? A man
may have private virtues as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) may have half a million in the funds.
What we du monde expect is, that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) should be lively, agreeable, keep a
decent figure, and pay his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) way. Colonel Esmond Warrington's grandfather
-LRB-in whose history and dwelling-place Mr. W. took an extraordinary
interest-RRB-, might once have been owner of this house of Castlewood,
and of the titles which belonged to its possessor. The gentleman often
looked at the Colonel's grave picture as it still hung in the saloon,
a copy or replica of which piece Mr. Warrington fondly remembered in
Virginia.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) must have been a little touched here,''  (<font color='red'><b>lord</b></font>)</div>my lord said, tapping his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) own
tall, placid forehead.

<p/>There are certain actions, simple and common with some men, which others
cannot understand, and deny as utter lies, or deride as acts of madness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I do you the justice to think, cousin,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Warrington to his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>)
lordship, <div class="bookquote">``that you would not give up any advantage for any friend in
the world.''

 (<font color='red'><b>lordship</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Eh! I am selfish: but am I more selfish than the rest of the world?''
 (<font color='red'><b>lord</b></font>)</div>asks my lord, with a French shrug of his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) shoulders, and a pinch out of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) box. Once, in their walks in the fields, his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) lordship happening
to wear a fine scarlet coat, a cow ran towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>); and the ordinarily
languid nobleman sprang over a stile with the agility of a schoolboy. He (<font color='blue'><b>schoolboy</b></font>)
did not conceal his (<font color='blue'><b>schoolboy</b></font>) tremor, or his (<font color='blue'><b>schoolboy</b></font>) natural want of courage. <div class="bookquote">``I dare say
you respect me no more than I respect myself, George,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>schoolboy</b></font>) would say, in
his (<font color='blue'><b>schoolboy</b></font>) candid way, and begin a very pleasant sardonical discourse upon the
fall of man, and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) faults, and shortcomings; and wonder why Heaven
had not made us all brave and tall, and handsome and rich? As for Mr.
Warrington, who very likely loved to be king of his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) company -LRB-as some
people do-RRB-, he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) could not help liking this kinsman of his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>), so witty,
graceful, polished, high-placed in the world--so utterly his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) inferior.
Like the animal in Mr. Sterne's famous book, <div class="bookquote">``Do not beat me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>)
lordship's look seemed to say, <div class="bookquote">``but, if you will, you may.''  (<font color='red'><b>lordship</b></font>)</div>No man, save
a bully and coward himself, deals hardly with a creature so spiritless.




<p/>CHAPTER LXXIII. We keep Christmas at Castlewood. 1759


<p/>We know, my dear children, from our favourite fairy story-books, how at
all christenings and marriages some one is invariably disappointed,
and vows vengeance; and so need not wonder that good cousin Will should
curse and rage energetically at the news of his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) brother's engagement
with the colonial heiress. At first, Will fled the house, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) wrath,
swearing he (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) would never return. But nobody, including the swearer,
believed much in Master Will's oaths; and this unrepentant prodigal,
after a day or two, came back to the paternal house. The fumes of the
marriage-feast allured him (<font color='blue'><b>Master</b></font>): he (<font color='blue'><b>Master</b></font>) could not afford to resign his (<font color='blue'><b>Master</b></font>) knife and
fork at Castlewood table. He (<font color='blue'><b>Master</b></font>) returned, and drank and ate there in token
of revenge. He (<font color='blue'><b>Master</b></font>) pledged the young bride in a bumper, and drank perdition
to her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) under his (<font color='blue'><b>Master</b></font>) breath. He (<font color='blue'><b>Master</b></font>) made responses of smothered maledictions
as her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) father gave her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) away in the chapel, and my lord vowed to love,
honour and cherish her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) was not the only grumbler respecting that
marriage, as Mr. Warrington knew: he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) heard, then and afterwards, no
end of abuse of my lady and her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) grandfather. The old gentleman's City
friends, his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) legal adviser, the Dissenting clergyman at whose chapel
they attended on their first arrival in England, and poor Jack Lambert,
the orthodox young divine, whose eloquence he (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) had fondly hoped had
been exerted over her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) in private, were bitter against the little lady's
treachery, and each had a story to tell of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) having been enslaved,
encouraged, jilted, by the young American. The lawyer, who had had such
an accurate list of all her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) properties, estates, moneys, slaves, ships,
expectations, was ready to vow and swear that he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) believed the whole
account was false; that there was no such place as New York or Virginia;
or at any rate, that Mr. Van den Bosch had no land there; that there was
no such thing as a Guinea trade, and that the negroes were so many
black falsehoods invented by the wily old planter. The Dissenting pastor
moaned over his (<font color='blue'><b>pastor</b></font>) stray lambling--if such a little, wily, mischievous
monster could be called a lamb at all. Poor Jack Lambert ruefully
acknowledged to his (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) mamma the possession of a lock of black hair, which
he (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) bedewed with tears and apostrophised in quite unclerical language:
and, as for Mr. William Esmond, he (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>), with the shrieks and curses in which
he (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) always freely indulged, even at Castlewood, under his (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) sister-in-law's
own pretty little nose, when under any strong emotion, called Acheron
to witness, that out of that region there did not exist such an artful
young devil as Miss Lydia. He (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) swore that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) was an infernal female
Cerberus, and called down all the wrath of this world and the next upon
his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) swindling rascal of a brother, who had cajoled him (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) with fair words,
and filched his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) prize from him (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Warrington -LRB-when Will expatiated on these matters with
him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>)-RRB-, <div class="bookquote">``if the girl is such a she-devil as you describe her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), you are all
the better for losing her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). If she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) intends to deceive her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) husband, and
to give him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) a dose of poison, as you say, how lucky for you, you are not
the man! You ought to thank the gods, Will, instead of cursing them, for
robbing you of such a fury, and can't be better revenged on Castlewood
than by allowing him (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) sole possession.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``All this was very well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Will/Will/Will Esmond</b></font>)</div>Will Esmond said; but--not unjustly,
perhaps,--remarked that his (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) brother was not the less a scoundrel for
having cheated him (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) out of the fortune which he (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) expected to get, and
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) had risked his (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) life to win, too.

<p/>George Warrington was at a loss to know how his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) cousin had been made
so to risk his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) precious existence -LRB-for which, perhaps, a rope's end
had been a fitting termination-RRB-, on which Will Esmond, with the utmost
candour, told his (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) kinsman how the little Cerbera had actually caused
the meeting between them, which was interrupted somehow by Sir John
Fielding's men; how she (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) was always saying that George Warrington was a
coward for ever sneering at Mr. Will, and the latter doubly a poltroon
for not taking notice of his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) kinsman's taunts; how George had run away
and nearly died of fright in Braddock's expedition; and <div class="bookquote">``Deuce take me,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Braddock/Mr. Braddock</b></font>)</div>says Will, <div class="bookquote">``I never was more surprised, cousin, than when you stood to
your ground so coolly in Tottenham Court Fields yonder, for me and my
second offered to wager that you would never come!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Will/Will/Will Esmond</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Warrington laughed, and thanked Mr. Will for this opinion of him (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Though,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>says he (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``cousin, `twas lucky for me the constables came up,
or you would have whipped your sword through my body in another minute.
Didn't you see how clumsy I was as I stood before you? And you actually
turned white and shook with anger!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, curse me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Will/Will/Will Esmond</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Will -LRB-who turned very red this time-RRB-, <div class="bookquote">``that's
my way of showing my rage; and I was confoundedly angry with you,
cousin! But now `tis my brother I hate, and that little devil of a
Countess--a countess! a pretty countess, indeed!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Will/Will/Will Esmond</b></font>)</div>And with another
rumbling cannonade of oaths, Will saluted the reigning member of his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>)
family.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, cousin,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>says George, looking him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) queerly in the face, <div class="bookquote">``you let
me off easily, and I dare say I owe my life to you, or at any rate a
whole waistcoat, and I admire your forbearance and spirit. What a pity
that a courage like yours should be wasted as a mere court usher! You
are a loss to his (<font color='blue'><b>usher</b></font>) Majesty's army. You positively are!''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I never know whether you are joking or serious, Mr. Warrington,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>growls
Will.

<p/>``I should think very few gentlemen would dare to joke with you, cousin,
if they had a regard for their own lives or ears! cries Mr. Warrington,
who loved this grave way of dealing with his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) noble kinsman, and used to
watch, with a droll interest, the other choking his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) curses, grinding his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>)
teeth because afraid to bite, and smothering his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) cowardly anger.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And you should moderate your expressions, cousin, regarding the dear
Countess and my lord your brother,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>Mr. Warrington resumed. <div class="bookquote">``Of you they
always speak most tenderly. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) ladyship has told me everything.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What everything?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>cries Will, aghast.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``As much as women ever do tell, cousin. She (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) owned that she (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) thought you
had been a little epris with her (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>). What woman can help liking a man who
has admired her (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, she (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) hates you, and says you were wild about her (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>), Mr. Warrington!''
 (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Esmond.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Spretae injuria formae, cousin!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``For me--what's for me?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>asks the other.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I never did care for her (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>), and hence, perhaps, she (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) does not love me.
Don't you remember that case of the wife of the Captain of the Guard?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Which Guard?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>asks Will.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My Lord Potiphar,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Warrington.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Lord Who? My Lord Falmouth is Captain of the Yeomen of the Guard,
and my Lord Berkeley of the Pensioners. My Lord Hobart had `em before.
Suppose you haven't been long enough in England to know who's who,
cousin!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. William/William/William Esmond</b></font>)</div>remarks Mr. William.

<p/>But Mr. Warrington explained that he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) was speaking of a Captain of the
Guard of the King of Egypt, whose wife had persecuted one Joseph for not
returning her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) affection for him (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>). On which Will said that, as for
Egypt, he (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) believed it was a confounded long way off; and that if Lord
What-d’ye-call's wife told lies about him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>), it was like her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) sex, who he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>)
supposed were the same everywhere.

<p/>Now the truth is, that when he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) paid his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) marriage-visit to Castlewood,
Mr. Warrington had heard from the little Countess her (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) version of the
story of differences between Will Esmond and herself. And this tale
differed, in some respects, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) is far from saying it is more
authentic than the ingenuous narrative of Mr. Will. The lady was grieved
to think how she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had been deceived in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) brother-in-law. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) feared
that his (<font color='blue'><b>brother-in-law</b></font>) life about the court and town had injured those high principles
which all the Esmonds are known to be born with; that Mr. Will's words
were not altogether to be trusted; that a loose life and pecuniary
difficulties had made him (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) mercenary, blunted his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) honour, perhaps even
impaired the high chivalrous courage <div class="bookquote">``which we Esmonds, cousin,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>the
little lady said, tossing her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) head, <div class="bookquote">``which we Esmonds must always
possess--leastways, you and me, and my lord, and my cousin Harry have
it, I know!''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>says the Countess. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, cousin George! and must I confess
that I was led to doubt of yours, without which a man of ancient and
noble family like ours isn't worthy to be called a man! I shall try,
George, as a Christian lady, and the head of one of the first families
in this kingdom and the whole world, to forgive my brother William for
having spoke ill of a member of our family, though a younger branch and
by the female side, and made me for a moment doubt of you. He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) did so.
Perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) told me ever so many bad things you had said of me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I, my dear lady!''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>cries Mr. Warrington.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Which he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) said you said of me, cousin, and I hope you didn't, and
heartily pray you didn't; and I can afford to despise `em. And he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) paid
me his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) court, that's a fact; and so have others, and that I'm used to;
and he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) might have prospered better than he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) did perhaps -LRB-for I did not
know my dear lord, nor come to vally his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) great and eminent qualities, as
I do out of the fulness of this grateful heart now!-RRB-, but, oh! I found
William was deficient in courage, and no man as wants that can ever have
the esteem of Lydia, Countess of Castlewood, no more he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) can! He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) said
`twas you that wanted for spirit, cousin, and angered me by telling me
that you was always abusing of me. But I forgive you, George, that I
do! And when I tell you that it was he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) was afraid--the mean skunk!--and
actually sent for them constables to prevent the match between you and
he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>), you won't wonder I wouldn't vally a feller like that--no, not that
much!''  (<font color='red'><b>ladyship</b></font>)</div>and her (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) ladyship snapped her (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) little fingers. ``I say, noblesse
oblige, and a man of our family who hasn't got courage, I don't care not
this pinch of snuff for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)--there, now, I don't! Look at our ancestors,
George, round these walls! Haven't the Esmonds always fought for their
country and king? Is there one of us that, when the moment arrives,
ain't ready to show that he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)'s an Esmond and a nobleman? If my eldest son
was to show the white feather, `My Lord Esmond!' I would say to him (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) -LRB-for
that's the second title in our family-RRB-, `I disown your lordship!''' And
so saying, the intrepid little woman looked round at her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) ancestors,
whose effigies, depicted by Lely and Kneller, figured round the walls of
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) drawing-room at Castlewood.

<p/>Over that apartment, and the whole house, domain, and village, the
new Countess speedily began to rule with an unlimited sway. It was
surprising how quickly she (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) learned the ways of command; and, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>)
did not adopt those methods of precedence usual in England among great
ladies, invented regulations for herself, and promulgated them, and made
others submit. Having been bred a Dissenter, and not being over-familiar
with the Established Church service, Mr. Warrington remarked that she (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>)
made a blunder or two during the office -LRB-not knowing, for example,
when she (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) was to turn her (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) face towards the east, a custom not adopted, I
believe, in other Reforming churches besides the English-RRB-; but between
Warrington's first bridal visit to Castlewood and his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) second, my lady
had got to be quite perfect in that part of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) duty, and sailed into
chapel on her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) cousin's arm, her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) two footmen bearing her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) ladyship's great
Prayer-book behind her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), as demurely as that delightful old devotee with
her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) lackey, in Mr. Hogarth's famous picture of <div class="bookquote">``Morning,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Hogarth</b></font>)</div>and as if
my Lady Lydia had been accustomed to have a chaplain all her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) life. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>)
seemed to patronise not only the new chaplain, but the service and the
church itself, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) had never in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) own country heard a Ranter in
a barn. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) made the oldest established families in the country--grave
baronets and their wives--worthy squires of twenty descents, who rode
over to Castlewood to pay the bride and bridegroom honour--know their
distance, as the phrase is, and give her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) the pas. She (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) got an old
heraldry book; and a surprising old maiden lady from Winton, learned in
politeness and genealogies, from whom she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) learned the court etiquette
-LRB-as the old Winton lady had known it in Queen Anne's time-RRB-; and ere long
she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) jabbered gules and sables, bends and saltires, not with correctness
always, but with a wonderful volubility and perseverance. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) made
little progresses to the neighbouring towns in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) gilt coach-and-six,
or to the village in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) chair, and asserted a quasi-regal right of
homage from her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) tenants and other clodpoles. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) lectured the parson
on his (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) divinity; the bailiff on his (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) farming; instructed the astonished
housekeeper how to preserve and pickle; would have taught the great
London footmen to jump behind the carriage, only it was too high for her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>)
little ladyship to mount; gave the village gossips instructions how to
nurse and take care of their children long before she (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) had one herself;
and as for physic, Madam Esmond in Virginia was not more resolute about
her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) pills and draughts than Miss Lydia, the earl's new bride. Do you
remember the story of the Fisherman and the Genie, in the Arabian
Nights? So one wondered with regard to this lady, how such a prodigious
genius could have been corked down into such a little bottle as her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
body. When Mr. Warrington returned to London after his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) first nuptial
visit, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) a little present for her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) young friends in Dean
Street, as she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) called them -LRB-Theo being older, and Hetty scarce younger
than herself-RRB-, and sent a trinket to one and a book to the other--G.
Warrington always vowing that Theo's present was a doll, while Hetty's
share was a nursery-book with words of one syllable. As for Mr. Will,
her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) younger brother-in-law, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) treated him (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) with a maternal gravity
and tenderness, and was in the habit of speaking of and to him (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) with a
protecting air, which was infinitely diverting to Warrington, although
Will's usual curses and blasphemies were sorely increased by her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
behaviour.

<p/>As for old age, my Lady Lydia had little respect for that accident in
the life of some gentlemen and gentlewomen; and, once the settlements
were made in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) behalf, treated the ancient Van den Bosch and his (<font color='blue'><b>Bosch</b></font>) large
periwig with no more ceremony than Dinah her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) black attendant, whose
great ears she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) would pinch, and whose woolly pate she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) would pull without
scruple, upon offence given--so at least Dinah told Gumbo, who told
his (<font color='blue'><b>Bosch</b></font>) master. All the household trembled before my lady the Countess: the
housekeeper, of whom even my lord and the dowager had been in awe; the
pampered London footmen, who used to quarrel if they were disturbed at
their cards, and grumbled as they swilled the endless beer, now stepped
nimbly about their business when they heard her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) ladyship's call; even
old Lockwood, who had been gate-porter for half a century or more, tried
to rally his (<font color='blue'><b>Lockwood</b></font>) poor old wandering wits when she (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) came into his (<font color='blue'><b>Lockwood</b></font>) lodge to
open his (<font color='blue'><b>Lockwood</b></font>) window, inspect his (<font color='blue'><b>Lockwood</b></font>) wood-closet, and turn his (<font color='blue'><b>Lockwood</b></font>) old dogs out of
doors. Lockwood bared his (<font color='blue'><b>Lockwood</b></font>) old bald head before his (<font color='blue'><b>Lockwood</b></font>) new mistress, turned
an appealing look towards his (<font color='blue'><b>Lockwood</b></font>) niece, and vaguely trembled before her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>)
little ladyship's authority. Gumbo, dressing his (<font color='blue'><b>Lockwood</b></font>) master for dinner,
talked about Elisha -LRB-of whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Elisha</b></font>) had heard the chaplain read in the
morning-RRB-, <div class="bookquote">``and his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) bald head and de boys who call um names, and de bars
eat em up, and serve um right,''  (<font color='red'><b>the chaplain</b></font>)</div>says Gumbo. But as for my lady, when
discoursing with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) cousin about the old porter, <div class="bookquote">``Pooh, pooh! Stupid
old man!''  (<font color='red'><b>the porter</b></font>)</div>says she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``past his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) work, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) dirty old dogs! They are
as old and ugly as those old fish in the pond!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>-LRB-Here she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) pointed to two
old monsters of carp that had been in a pond in Castlewood gardens for
centuries, according to tradition, and had their backs all covered with
a hideous grey mould.-RRB- <div class="bookquote">``Lockwood must pack off; the workhouse is the
place for him (<font color='blue'><b>Lockwood</b></font>); and I shall have a smart, good-looking, tall fellow in
the lodge that will do credit to our livery.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) was my grandfather's man, and served him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) in the wars of Queen Anne,''
 (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>interposed Mr. Warrington. On which my lady cried, petulantly, <div class="bookquote">``O Lord!
Queen Anne's dead, I suppose, and we ain't a-going into mourning for
her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>lady</b></font>)</div><p/>This matter of Lockwood was discussed at the family dinner, when her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
ladyship announced her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) intention of getting rid of the old man.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am told,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Van den Bosch/Van den Bosch/Mr. Van</b></font>)</div>demurely remarks Mr. Van den Bosch, <div class="bookquote">``that, by the laws,
poor servants and poor folks of all kinds are admirably provided in
their old age here in England. I am sure I wish we had such an asylum
for our folks at home, and that we were eased of the expense of keeping
our old hands.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Van den Bosch/Van den Bosch/Mr. Van</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If a man can't work he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ought to go!''  (<font color='red'><b>ladyship</b></font>)</div>cries her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) ladyship.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, indeed, and that's a fact!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>says grandpapa.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What! an old servant?''  (<font color='red'><b>lord</b></font>)</div>asks my lord.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Van den Bosch possibly was independent of servants when he (<font color='blue'><b>Bosch</b></font>) was
young,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>remarks Mr. Warrington.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Greased my own boots, opened my own shutters, sanded and watered my
own--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sugar, sir?''  (<font color='red'><b>lord</b></font>)</div>says my lord.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No; floor, son-in-law!''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>says the old man, with a laugh; <div class="bookquote">``though there
is such tricks, in grocery stores, saving your ladyship's presence.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``La, pa! what should I know about stores and groceries?''  (<font color='red'><b>ladyship</b></font>)</div>cries her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
ladyship.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>son-in-law</b></font>)! Remember stealing the sugar, and what came on it, my dear
ladyship?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>says grandpapa.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``At any rate, a handsome, well-grown man in our livery will look better
than that shrivelled old porter creature!''  (<font color='red'><b>lady</b></font>)</div>cries my lady.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No livery is so becoming as old age, madam, and no lace as handsome
as silver hairs,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Warrington. <div class="bookquote">``What will the county say if you
banish old Lockwood?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! if you plead for him (<font color='blue'><b>Lockwood</b></font>), sir, I suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>Lockwood</b></font>) must stay. Hadn't I better
order a couch for him (<font color='blue'><b>Lockwood</b></font>) out of my drawing-room, and send him (<font color='blue'><b>Lockwood</b></font>) some of the
best wine from the cellar?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed your ladyship couldn't do better,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>Mr. Warrington remarked, very
gravely.

<p/>And my lord said, yawning, <div class="bookquote">``Cousin George is perfectly right, my dear.
To turn away such an old servant as Lockwood would have an ill look.''

 (<font color='red'><b>lord</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You see those mouldy old carps are, after all, a curiosity, and attract
visitors,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>continues Mr. Warrington, gravely. <div class="bookquote">``Your ladyship must allow
this old wretch to remain. It won't be for long. And you may then engage
the tall porter. It is very hard on us, Mr. Van den Bosch, that we are
obliged to keep our old negroes when they are past work. I shall sell
that rascal Gumbo in eight or ten years.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't tink you will, master!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>says Gumbo, grinning.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hold your tongue, sir! He (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) doesn't know English ways, you see, and
perhaps thinks an old servant has a claim on his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) master's kindness,''
 (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Warrington.

<p/>The next day, to Warrington's surprise, my lady absolutely did send a
basket of good wine to Lockwood, and a cushion for his (<font color='blue'><b>Lockwood</b></font>) armchair.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought of what you said, yesterday, at night when I went to bed; and
guess you know the world better than I do, cousin; and that it's best to
keep the old man, as you say.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the porter</b></font>)</div><p/>And so this affair of the porter's lodge ended, Mr. Warrington wondering
within himself at this strange little character out of the West, with
her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) naivete and simplicities, and a heartlessness would have done credit
to the most battered old dowager who ever turned trumps in St. James's.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You tell me to respect old people. Why? I don't see nothin' to respect
in the old people, I know,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said to Warrington. <div class="bookquote">``They ain't so
funny, and I'm sure they ain't so handsome. Look at grandfather; look
at Aunt Bernstein. They say she (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) was a beauty once! That picture painted
from her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>)! I don't believe it, nohow. No one shall tell me that I shall
ever be as bad as that! When they come to that, people oughtn't to live.
No, that they oughtn't.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Aunt Bernstein</b></font>)</div><p/>Now, at Christmas, Aunt Bernstein came to pay her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) nephew and niece a
visit, in company with Mr. Warrington. They travelled at their leisure
in the Baroness's own landau; the old lady being in particular good
health and spirits, the weather delightfully fresh and not too cold;
and, as they approached her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) paternal home, Aunt Beatrice told her (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>)
companion a hundred stories regarding it and old days. Though often
lethargic, and not seldom, it must be confessed, out of temper, the old
lady would light up at times, when her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) conversation became wonderfully
lively, her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) wit and malice were brilliant, and her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) memory supplied her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
with a hundred anecdotes of a bygone age and society. Sure, `tis hard
with respect to Beauty, that its possessor should not have even a
life-enjoyment of it, but be compelled to resign it after, at the most,
some forty years' lease. As the old woman prattled of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) former lovers
and admirers -LRB-her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) auditor having much more information regarding her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
past career than her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) ladyship knew of-RRB-, I would look in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) face, and,
out of the ruins, try to build up in my fancy a notion of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) beauty in
its prime. What a homily I read there! How the courts were grown
with grass, the towers broken, the doors ajar, the fine gilt saloons
tarnished, and the tapestries cobwebbed and torn! Yonder dilapidated
palace was all alive once with splendour and music, and those dim
windows were dazzling and blazing with light! What balls and feasts were
once here, what splendour and laughter! I could see lovers in waiting,
crowds in admiration, rivals furious. I could imagine twilight
assignations, and detect intrigues, though the curtains were close and
drawn. I was often minded to say to the old woman as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) talked, <div class="bookquote">``Madam,
I know the story was not as you tell it, but so and so'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>---LRB-I had read at
home the history of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) life, as my dear old grandfather had wrote it-RRB-:
and my fancy wandered about in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), amused and solitary, as I had walked
about our father's house at Castlewood, meditating on departed glories,
and imagining ancient times.

<p/>When Aunt Bernstein came to Castlewood, her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) relatives there, more, I
think, on account of her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) own force of character, imperiousness, and
sarcastic wit, than from their desire to possess her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) money, were
accustomed to pay her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) a great deal of respect and deference, which
she (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) accepted as her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) due. She (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) expected the same treatment from the new
Countess, whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) was prepared to greet with special good-humour. The
match had been of her (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) making. <div class="bookquote">``As you, you silly creature, would not
have the heiress,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I was determined she (<font color='blue'><b>heiress</b></font>) should not go out of
the family,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and she (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) laughingly told of many little schemes for bringing
the marriage about. She (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) had given the girl a coronet and her (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) nephew
a hundred thousand pounds. Of course she (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) should be welcome to both of
them. She (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) was delighted with the little Countess's courage and spirit
in routing the Dowager and Lady Fanny. Almost always pleased with pretty
people on her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) first introduction to them, Madame Bernstein raffled of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) niece Lydia's bright eyes and lovely little figure. The marriage was
altogether desirable. The old man was an obstacle, to be sure, and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
talk and appearance somewhat too homely. But he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) will be got rid of.
He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is old and in delicate health. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) will want to go to America, or
perhaps farther,''  (<font color='red'><b>Baroness/Baroness Bernstein/Bernstein</b></font>)</div>says the Baroness, with a shrug. <div class="bookquote">``As for the child,
she (<font color='blue'><b>heiress</b></font>) had great fire and liveliness, and a Cherokee manner which is not
without its charm,''  (<font color='red'><b>Baroness/Baroness Bernstein/Bernstein</b></font>)</div>said the pleased old Baroness. <div class="bookquote">``Your brother had
it--so have you, Master George! Nous la formerons, cette petite. Eugene
wants character and vigour, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Eugene</b></font>) is a finished gentleman, and between
us we shall make the little savage perfectly presentable.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>In this
way we discoursed on the second afternoon as we journeyed towards
Castlewood. We lay at the King's Arms at Bagshot the first night, where
the Baroness was always received with profound respect, and thence
drove post to Hexton, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) had written to have my lord's horses in
waiting for her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>); but these were not forthcoming at the inn, and after
a couple of hours we were obliged to proceed with our Bagshot horses to
Castlewood.

<p/>During this last stage of the journey, I am bound to say the old aunt's
testy humour returned, and she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) scarce spoke a single word for three
hours. As for her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) companion; being prodigiously in love at the time,
no doubt he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) did not press his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) aunt for conversation, but thought
unceasingly about his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) Dulcinea, until the coach actually reached
Castlewood Common, and rolled over the bridge before the house.

<p/>The housekeeper was ready to conduct her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) ladyship to her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) apartments. My
lord and lady were both absent. She (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) did not know what had kept them, the
housekeeper said, heading the way.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not that door, my lady!''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>cries the woman, as Madame de Bernstein
put her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hand upon the door of the room which she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had always occupied.
<div class="bookquote">``That's her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) ladyship's room now. This way,''  (<font color='red'><b>aunt</b></font>)</div>and our aunt followed, by
no means in increased good-humour. I do not envy her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) maids when their
mistress was displeased. But she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had cleared her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) brow before she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) joined
the family, and appeared in the drawing-room before supper-time with a
countenance of tolerable serenity.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How d’ye do, aunt?''  (<font color='red'><b>the Countess</b></font>)</div>was the Countess's salutation. <div class="bookquote">``I declare now, I
was taking a nap when your ladyship arrived! Hope you found your room
fixed to your liking!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div><p/>Having addressed three brief sentences to the astonished old lady, the
Countess now turned to her (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) other guests, and directed her (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) conversation
to them. Mr. Warrington was not a little diverted by her (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) behaviour,
and by the appearance of surprise and wrath which began to gather over
Madame Bernstein's face. <div class="bookquote">``La petite,''  (<font color='red'><b>Baroness/Baroness Bernstein/Bernstein</b></font>)</div>whom the Baroness proposed to
<div class="bookquote">``form,''  (<font color='red'><b>Baroness/Baroness Bernstein/Bernstein</b></font>)</div>was rather a rebellious subject, apparently, and proposed to
take a form of her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) own. Looking once or twice rather anxiously towards
his (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>) wife, my lord tried to atone for her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) pertness towards his (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>) aunt by
profuse civility on his (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>) own part; indeed, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>) so wished, no man
could be more courteous or pleasing. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>) found a score of agreeable
things to say to Madame Bernstein. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>) warmly congratulated Mr.
Warrington on the glorious news which had come from America, and on his (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>)
brother's safety. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>) drank a toast at supper to Captain Warrington. <div class="bookquote">``Our
family is distinguishing itself, cousin,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) said; and added, looking
with fond significance towards his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) Countess, <div class="bookquote">``I hope the happiest days
are in store for us all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Countess</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, George!''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>says the little lady. <div class="bookquote">``You'll write and tell Harry that
we are all very much pleased with him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). This action at Quebec is a most
glorious action; and now we have turned the French king out of the
country, shouldn't be at all surprised if we set up for ourselves in
America.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My love, you are talking treason!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord</b></font>)</div>cries Lord Castlewood.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am talking reason, anyhow, my lord. I've no notion of folks being
kept down, and treated as children for ever!''

 (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div><p/>George! Harry! I protest I was almost as much astonished as amused.
<div class="bookquote">``When my brother hears that your ladyship is satisfied with his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) conduct,
his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) happiness will be complete,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said gravely.

<p/>Next day, when talking beside her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) sofa, where she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) chose to lie in state,
the little Countess no longer called her (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) cousin <div class="bookquote">``George,''  (<font color='red'><b>cousin George</b></font>)</div>but <div class="bookquote">``Mr.
George,''  (<font color='red'><b>cousin George</b></font>)</div>as before; on which Mr. George laughingly said she (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) had changed
her (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) language since the previous day.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Guess I did it to tease old Madam Buzwig,''  (<font color='red'><b>ladyship</b></font>)</div>says her (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) ladyship. She (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) wants
to treat me as a child, and do the grandmother over me. I don't want no
grandmothers, I don't. I'm the head of this house, and I intend to let
her (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) know it. And I've brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) all the way from London in order to
tell it her (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>), too! La! how she (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) did look when I called you George! I might
have called you George--only you had seen that little Theo first, and
liked her (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) best, I suppose.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I suppose I like her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) best,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>says Mr. George.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I like you because you tell the truth. Because you was the only
one of `em in London who didn't seem to care for my money, though I was
downright mad and angry with you once, and with myself too, and with
that little sweetheart of yours, who ain't to be compared to me, I know
she (<font color='blue'><b>sweetheart</b></font>) ain't.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't let us make the comparison, then!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said, laughing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose people must lie on their beds as they make `em,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>says she (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>),
with a little sigh. <div class="bookquote">``Dare say Miss Theo is very good, and you'll marry
her (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) and go to Virginia, and be as dull as we are here. We were talking
of Miss Lambert, my lord, and I was wishing my cousin joy. How is old
Goody to-day? What a supper she (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) did eat last night, and drink!--drink
like a dragoon! No wonder she (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) has got a headache, and keeps her (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) room.
Guess it takes her (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) ever so long to dress herself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You, too, may be feeble when you are old, and require rest and wine to
warm you!''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Warrington.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hope I shan't be like her (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) when I'm old, anyhow!''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>says the lady. <div class="bookquote">``Can't
see why I am to respect an old woman, because she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hobbles on a stick,
and has shaky hands, and false teeth!''  (<font color='red'><b>the heathen</b></font>)</div>And the little heathen sank back
on her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) couch, and showed twenty-four pearls of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) own.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Law!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) adds, after gazing at both her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) hearers through the curled
lashes of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) brilliant dark eyes. <div class="bookquote">``How frightened you both look! My
lord has already given me ever so many sermons about old Goody. You are
both afraid of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>): and I ain't, that's all. Don't look so scared at one
another! I ain't a-going to bite her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) head off. We shall have a battle,
and I intend to win. How did I serve the Dowager, if you please, and my
Lady Fanny, with their high and mighty airs, when they tried to put
down the Countess of Castlewood in her (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) own house, and laugh at the poor
American girl? We had a fight, and which got the best of it, pray? Me
and Goody will have another, and when it is over, you will see that we
shall both be perfect friends!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Madame</b></font>)</div><p/>When at this point of our conversation the door opened, and Madame
Beatrix, elaborately dressed according to her (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrix</b></font>) wont, actually made her (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrix</b></font>)
appearance, I, for my part, am not ashamed to own that I felt as great a
panic as ever coward experienced. My lord, with his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) profoundest bows and
blandest courtesies, greeted his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) aunt and led her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) to the fire, by which
my lady -LRB-who was already hoping for an heir to Castlewood-RRB- lay reclining
on her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) sofa. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) did not attempt to rise, but smiled a greeting to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
venerable guest. And then, after a brief talk, in which she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) showed a
perfect self-possession, while the two gentlemen blundered and hesitated
with the most dastardly tremor, my lord said:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If we are to look for those pheasants, cousin, we had better go now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>lord</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And I and aunt will have a cosy afternoon. And you will tell me about
Castlewood in the old times, won't you, Baroness?''  (<font color='red'><b>the mistress</b></font>)</div>says the new mistress
of the mansion.

<p/>O les laches que les hommes! I was so frightened, that I scarce saw
anything, but vaguely felt that Lady Castlewood's dark eyes were
following me. My lord gripped my arm in the corridor, we quickened our
paces till our retreat became a disgraceful run. We did not breathe
freely till we were in the open air in the courtyard, where the keepers
and the dogs were waiting.

<p/>And what happened? I protest, children, I don't know. But this is
certain: if your mother had been a woman of the least spirit, or had
known how to scold for five minutes during as many consecutive days of
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) early married life, there would have been no more humble, henpecked
wretch in Christendom than your father. When Parson Blake comes to
dinner, don't you see how at a glance from his (<font color='blue'><b>Blake</b></font>) little wife he (<font color='blue'><b>Blake</b></font>) puts his (<font color='blue'><b>Blake</b></font>)
glass down and says, <div class="bookquote">``No, thank you, Mr. Gumbo,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>when old Gum brings
him (<font color='blue'><b>Blake</b></font>) wine? Blake wore a red coat before he (<font color='blue'><b>Blake</b></font>) took to black, and walked up
Breeds Hill with a thousand bullets whistling round his (<font color='blue'><b>Hill</b></font>) ears, before
ever he (<font color='blue'><b>Hill</b></font>) saw our Bunker Hill in Suffolk. And the fire-eater of the 43rd
now dare not face a glass of old port wine! `Tis his (<font color='blue'><b>Hill</b></font>) wife has subdued
his (<font color='blue'><b>Hill</b></font>) courage. The women can master us, and did they know their own
strength, were invincible.

<p/>Well, then, what happened I know not on that disgraceful day of panic
when your father fled the field, nor dared to see the heroines engage;
but when we returned from our shooting, the battle was over. America had
revolted, and conquered the mother country.




<p/>CHAPTER LXXIV. News from Canada


<p/>Our Castlewood relatives kept us with them till the commencement of the
new year, and after a fortnight's absence -LRB-which seemed like an age
to the absurd and infatuated young man-RRB- he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) returned to the side of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
charmer. Madame de Bernstein was not sorry to leave the home of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
father. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) began to talk more freely as we got away from the place.
What passed during that interview in which the battle-royal between her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
and her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) niece occurred, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) never revealed. But the old lady talked
no more of forming cette petite, and, indeed, when she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) alluded to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>),
spoke in a nervous, laughing way, but without any hostility towards the
young Countess. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) nephew Eugene, she (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) said, was doomed to be henpecked
for the rest of his (<font color='blue'><b>Eugene</b></font>) days that she (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) saw clearly. A little order brought
into the house would do it all the good possible. The little old
vulgar American gentleman seemed to be a shrewd person, and would act
advantageously as a steward. The Countess's mother was a convict, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
had heard, sent out from England, where no doubt she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had beaten hemp in
most of the gaols; but this news need not be carried to the town-crier;
and, after all, in respect to certain kind of people, what mattered what
their birth was? The young woman would be honest for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) own sake now:
was shrewd enough, and would learn English presently; and the name to
which she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had a right was great enough to get her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) into any society. A
grocer, a smuggler, a slave-dealer, what mattered Mr. Van den Bosch's
pursuit or previous profession? The Countess of Castlewood could afford
to be anybody's daughter, and as soon as my nephew produced her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>), says
the old lady, it is our duty to stand by her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>).

<p/>The ties of relationship binding Madame de Bernstein strongly to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
nephew, Mr. Warrington hoped that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) would be disposed to be equally
affectionate to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) niece; and spoke of his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) visit to Mr. Hagan and his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>)
wife, for whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) entreated her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) aunt's favour. But the old lady was
obdurate regarding Lady Maria; begged that her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) name might never be
mentioned, and immediately went on for two hours talking about no one
else. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) related a series of anecdotes regarding her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) niece, which, as
this book lies open virginibus puerisque, to all the young people of the
family, I shall not choose to record. But this I will say of the kind
creature, that if she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) sinned, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) was not the only sinner of the family,
and if she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) repented, that others will do well to follow her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) example.
Hagan, `tis known, after he (<font color='blue'><b>Hagan</b></font>) left the stage, led an exemplary life,
and was remarkable for elegance and eloquence in the pulpit. His (<font color='blue'><b>Hagan</b></font>) lady
adopted extreme views, but was greatly respected in the sect which she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
joined; and when I saw her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) last, talked to me of possessing a peculiar
spiritual illumination, which I strongly suspected at the time to be
occasioned by the too free use of liquor: but I remember when she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) and
her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) husband were good to me and mine, at a period when sympathy was
needful, and many a Pharisee turned away.

<p/>I have told how easy it was to rise and fall in my fickle aunt's favour,
and how each of us brothers, by turns, was embraced and neglected. My
turn of glory had been after the success of my play. I was introduced
to the town-wits; held my place in their company tolerably well;
was pronounced to be pretty well bred by the macaronis and people of
fashion, and might have run a career amongst them had my purse been long
enough; had I chose to follow that life; had I not loved at that time
a pair of kind eyes better than the brightest orbs of the Gunnings or
Chudleighs, or all the painted beauties of the Ranelagh ring. Because I
was fond of your mother, will it be believed, children, that my tastes
were said to be low, and deplored by my genteel family? So it was, and I
know that my godly Lady Warrington and my worldly Madame Bernstein both
laid their elderly heads together and lamented my way of life. <div class="bookquote">``Why,
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Gumbo</b></font>) name, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gumbo</b></font>) might marry anybody,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>says meek Religion, who had ever
one eye on Heaven and one on the main chance. <div class="bookquote">``I meddle with no man's
affairs, and admire genius,''  (<font color='red'><b>uncle pity</b></font>)</div>says uncle, <div class="bookquote">``but it is a pity you consort
with those poets and authors, and that sort of people, and that, when
you might have had a lovely creature, with a hundred thousand pounds,
you let her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) slip and make up to a country girl without a penny-piece.''

 (<font color='red'><b>uncle pity</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But if I had promised her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), uncle?''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>says I.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Promise, promise! these things are matters of arrangement and prudence,
and demand a careful look-out. When you first committed yourself with
little Miss Lambert, you had not seen the lovely American lady whom your
mother wished you to marry, as a good mother naturally would. And your
duty to your mother, nephew,--your duty to the Fifth Commandment, would
have warranted your breaking with Miss L., and fulfilling your excellent
mother's intentions regarding Miss--What was the Countess's Dutch name?
Never mind. A name is nothing; but a plumb, Master George, is something
to look at! Why, I have my dear little Miley at a dancing-school with
Miss Barwell, Nabob Barwell's daughter, and I don't disguise my wish
that the children may contract an attachment which may endure through
their lives! I tell the Nabob so. We went from the House of Commons
one dancing-day and saw them. `Twas beautiful to see the young things
walking a minuet together! It brought tears into my eyes, for I have a
feeling heart, George, and I love my boy!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But if I prefer Miss Lambert, uncle, with twopence to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) fortune, to
the Countess, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) hundred thousand pounds?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why then, sir, you have a singular taste, that's all,''  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>says the old
gentleman, turning on his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) heel and leaving me. And I could perfectly
understand his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) vexation at my not being able to see the world as he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
viewed it.

<p/>Nor did my Aunt Bernstein much like the engagement which I had made,
or the family with which I passed so much of my time. Their simple ways
wearied, and perhaps annoyed, the old woman of the world, and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) no
more relished their company than a certain person -LRB-who is not so black
as he (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>) is painted-RRB- likes holy water. The old lady chafed at my for ever
dangling at my sweetheart's lap. Having risen mightily in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) favour,
I began to fall again: and once more Harry was the favourite, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
brother, Heaven knows, not jealous.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was now our family hero. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wrote us brief letters from the seat of
war where he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was engaged; Madame Bernstein caring little at first
about the letters or the writer, for they were simple, and the facts he (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>)
narrated not over interesting. We had early learned in London the news
of the action on the glorious first of August at Minden, where Wolfe's
old regiment was one of the British six which helped to achieve the
victory on that famous day. At the same hour, the young General lay in
his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) bed, in sight of Quebec, stricken down by fever, and perhaps rage
and disappointment at the check which his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) troops had just received.

<p/>Arriving in the St. Lawrence in June, the fleet which brought Wolfe and
his (<font color='blue'><b>Wolfe</b></font>) army had landed them on the last day of the month on the Island of
Orleans, opposite which rises the great cliff of Quebec. After the great
action in which his (<font color='blue'><b>Wolfe</b></font>) General fell, the dear brother who accompanied the
chief, wrote home to me one of his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) simple letters, describing his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) modest
share in that glorious day, but added nothing to the many descriptions
already wrote of the action of the 13th of September, save only I
remember he (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) wrote, from the testimony of a brother aide-de-camp who was
by his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) side, that the General never spoke at all after receiving his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>)
death-wound, so that the phrase which has been put into the mouth of
the dying hero may be considered as no more authentic than an oration of
Livy or Thucydides.

<p/>From his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) position on the island, which lies in the great channel of the
river to the north of the town, the General was ever hungrily on the
look-out for a chance to meet and attack his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) enemy. Above the city and
below it he (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) landed,--now here and now there; he (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) was bent upon attacking
wherever he (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) saw an opening. `Twas surely a prodigious fault on the
part of the Marquis of Montcalm, to accept a battle from Wolfe on equal
terms, for the British General had no artillery, and when we had made
our famous scalade of the heights, and were on the Plains of Abraham,
we were a little nearer the city, certainly, but as far off as ever from
being within it.

<p/>The game that was played between the brave chiefs of those two gallant
little armies, and which lasted from July until Mr. Wolfe won the
crowning hazard in September, must have been as interesting a match as
ever eager players engaged in. On the very first night after the landing
-LRB-as my brother has narrated it-RRB- the sport began. At midnight the French
sent a flaming squadron of fireships down upon the British ships which
were discharging their stores at Orleans. Our seamen thought it was good
sport to tow the fireships clear of the fleet, and ground them on the
shore, where they burned out.

<p/>As soon as the French commander heard that our ships had entered the
river, he (<font color='blue'><b>commander</b></font>) marched to Beauport in advance of the city and there took up
a strong position. When our stores and hospitals were established, our
General crossed over from his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) island to the left shore, and drew nearer
to his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) enemy. He (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) had the ships in the river behind him (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>), but the whole
country in face of him (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) was in arms. The Indians in the forest seized
our advanced parties as they strove to clear it, and murdered them with
horrible tortures. The French were as savage as their Indian friends.
The Montmorenci River rushed between Wolfe and the enemy. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wolfe</b></font>) could
neither attack these nor the city behind them.

<p/>Bent on seeing whether there was no other point at which his (<font color='blue'><b>Bent</b></font>) foe might
be assailable, the General passed round the town of Quebec and skirted
the left shore beyond. Everywhere it was guarded, as well as in his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>)
immediate front, and having run the gauntlet of the batteries up and
down the river, he (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) returned to his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) post at Montmorenci. On the right of
the French position, across the Montmorenci River, which was fordable
at low tide, was a redoubt of the enemy. He (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) would have that. Perhaps,
to defend it the French chief would be forced out from his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) lines, and
a battle be brought on. Wolfe determined to play these odds. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wolfe</b></font>) would
fetch over the body of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wolfe</b></font>) army from the Island of Orleans, and attack
from the St. Lawrence. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lawrence</b></font>) would time his (<font color='blue'><b>Lawrence</b></font>) attack, so that, at
shallow water, his (<font color='blue'><b>Lawrence</b></font>) lieutenants, Murray and Townsend, might cross the
Montmorenci, and, at the last day of July, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lawrence</b></font>) played this desperate
game.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Lawrence</b></font>) first, and General Monckton, his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) second in command -LRB-setting out from
Point Levi, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Levi</b></font>) occupied-RRB-, crossed over the St. Lawrence from their
respective stations, being received with a storm of shot and artillery
as they rowed to the shore. No sooner were the troops landed than they
rushed at the French redoubt without order, were shot down before it in
great numbers, and were obliged to fall back. At the preconcerted signal
the troops on the other side of the Montmorenci avanced across the river
in perfect order. The enemy even evacuated the redoubt and fell back to
their lines; but from these the assailants were received with so severe
a fire that an impression on them was hopeless, and the General had to
retreat.

<p/>The battle of Montmorenci -LRB-which my brother Harry and I have fought
again many a time over our wine-RRB- formed the dismal burthen of the first
despatch from Mr. Wolfe which reached England and plunged us all in
gloom. What more might one expect of a commander so rash? What disasters
might one not foretell? Was ever scheme so wild as to bring three great
bodies of men, across broad rivers, in the face of murderous batteries,
merely on the chance of inducing an enemy, strongly entrenched and
guarded, to leave his (<font color='blue'><b>commander</b></font>) position and come out and engage us? `Twas
the talk of the town. No wonder grave people shook their heads, and
prophesied fresh disaster. The General, who took to his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) bed after this
failure, shuddering with fever, was to live barely six weeks longer,
and die immortal! How is it, and by what, and whom, that Greatness is
achieved? Is Merit--is Madness the patron? Is it Frolic or Fortune? Is
it Fate that awards successes and defeats? Is it the Just Cause that
ever wins? How did the French gain Canada from the savage, and we from
the French, and after which of the conquests was the right time to
sing Te Deum? We are always for implicating Heaven in our quarrels, and
causing the gods to intervene whatever the nodus may be. Does Broughton,
after pummelling and beating Slack, lift up a black eye to Jove and
thank him (<font color='blue'><b>Broughton</b></font>) for the victory? And if ten thousand boxers are to be so
heard, why not one? And if Broughton is to be grateful, what is Slack to
be?


<p/><div class="bookquote">``By the list of disabled officers -LRB-many of whom are of rank-RRB- you may
perceive, sir, that the army is much weakened. By the nature of this
river the most formidable part of the armament is deprived of the power
of acting, yet we have almost the whole force of Canada to oppose. In
this situation there is such a choice of difficulties, that I own
myself at a loss how to determine. The affairs of Great Britain, I know,
require the most vigorous measures; but then the courage of a handful
of brave men should be exerted only where there is some hope of a
favourable event. The admiral and I have examined the town with a view
to a general assault: and he (<font color='blue'><b>admiral</b></font>) would readily join in this or any
other measure for the public service; but I cannot propose to him (<font color='blue'><b>admiral</b></font>)
an undertaking of so dangerous a nature, and promising so little
success... I found myself so ill, and am still so weak, that I begged
the general officers to consult together for the public utility. They
are of opinion that they should try by conveying up a corps of 4000
or 5000 men -LRB-which is nearly the whole strength of the army, after the
points of Levi and Orleans are put in a proper state of defence-RRB- to draw
the enemy from their present position, and bring them to an action. I
have acquiesced in their proposal, and we are preparing to put it into
execution.''


 (<font color='red'><b>the General</b></font>)</div><p/>So wrote the General -LRB-of whose noble letters it is clear our dear scribe
was not the author or secretary-RRB- from his (<font color='blue'><b>secretary</b></font>) headquarters at Montmorenci
Falls on 2nd day of September; and on the 14th of October following,
the Rodney cutter arrived with the sad news in England. The attack had
failed, the chief was sick, the army dwindling, the menaced city so
strong that assault was almost impossible; <div class="bookquote">``the only chance was to fight
the Marquis of Montcalm upon terms of less disadvantage than attacking
his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) entrenchments, and, if possible, to draw him (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) from his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) present
position.''  (<font color='red'><b>the chief</b></font>)</div>Would the French chief, whose great military genius was known
in Europe, fall into such a snare? No wonder there were pale looks in
the City at the news, and doubt and gloom wheresoever it was known.

<p/>Three days after this first melancholy intelligence, came the famous
letters announcing that wonderful consummation of fortune with which Mr.
Wolfe's wonderful career ended. If no man is to be styled happy till his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
death, what shall we say of this one? His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) end was so glorious, that I
protest not even his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mother nor his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mistress ought to have deplored it,
or at any rate have wished him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) alive again. I know it is a hero we speak
of; and yet I vow I scarce know whether in the last act of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) life I
admire the result of genius, invention, and daring, or the boldness of
a gambler winning surprising odds. Suppose his (<font color='blue'><b>gambler</b></font>) ascent discovered a
half-hour sooner, and his (<font color='blue'><b>gambler</b></font>) people, as they would have been assuredly,
beaten back? Suppose the Marquis of Montcalm not to quit his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) entrenched
lines to accept that strange challenge? Suppose these points--and none
of them depend upon Mr. Wolfe at all--and what becomes of the glory
of the young hero, of the great minister who discovered him (<font color='blue'><b>minister</b></font>), of the
intoxicated nation which rose up frantic with self-gratulation at
the victory? I say, what fate is it that shapes our ends, or those of
nations? In the many hazardous games which my Lord Chatham played,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) won this prodigious one. And as the greedy British hand seized the
Canadas, it let fall the United States out of its grasp.

<p/>To be sure this wisdom d’apres coup is easy. We wonder at this man's
rashness now the deed is done, and marvel at the other's fault. What
generals some of us are upon paper! what repartees come to our mind when
the talk is finished! and, the game over, how well we see how it should
have been played! Writing of an event at a distance of thirty years,
`tis not difficult now to criticise and find fault. But at the time when
we first heard of Wolfe's glorious deeds upon the Plains of Abraham--of
that army marshalled in darkness and carried silently up the midnight
river--of those rocks scaled by the intrepid leader and his (<font color='blue'><b>leader</b></font>) troops--of
that miraculous security of the enemy, of his (<font color='blue'><b>leader</b></font>) present acceptance of our
challenge to battle, and of his (<font color='blue'><b>leader</b></font>) defeat on the open plain by the sheer
valour of his (<font color='blue'><b>leader</b></font>) conqueror--we were all intoxicated in England by the
news. The whole nation rose up and felt itself the stronger for Wolfe's
victory. Not merely all men engaged in the battle, but those at home who
had condemned its rashness, felt themselves heroes. Our spirit rose as
that of our enemy faltered. Friends embraced each other when they met.
Coffee-houses and public places were thronged with people eager to talk
the news. Courtiers rushed to the King and the great Minister by whose
wisdom the campaign had been decreed. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Minister</b></font>) showed himself, the people
followed him (<font color='blue'><b>Minister</b></font>) with shouts and blessings. People did not deplore the dead
warrior, but admired his (<font color='blue'><b>warrior</b></font>) euthanasia. Should James Wolfe's friends weep
and wear mourning, because a chariot had come from the skies to fetch
him (<font color='blue'><b>Wolfe</b></font>) away? Let them watch with wonder, and see him (<font color='blue'><b>Wolfe</b></font>) departing, radiant;
rising above us superior. To have a friend who had been near or about
him (<font color='blue'><b>Wolfe</b></font>) was to be distinguished. Every soldier who fought with him (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) was a
hero. In our fond little circle I know `twas a distinction to be
Harry's brother. We should not in the least wonder but that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), from his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
previous knowledge of the place, had found the way up the heights which
the British army took, and pointed it out to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) General. His (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) promotion
would follow as a matter of course. Why, even our Uncle Warrington wrote
letters to bless Heaven and congratulate me and himself upon the share
Harry had had in the glorious achievement. Our Aunt Beatrix opened her (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrix</b></font>)
house and received company upon the strength of the victory. I became a
hero from my likeness to my brother. As for Parson Sampson, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) preached
such a sermon that his (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) auditors -LRB-some of whom had been warned by his (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>)
reverence of the coming discourse-RRB- were with difficulty restrained from
huzzaing the orator, and were mobbed as they left the chapel. <div class="bookquote">``Don't
talk to me, madam, about grief,''  (<font color='red'><b>General</b></font>)</div>says General Lambert to his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) wife,
who, dear soul, was for allowing herself some small indulgence of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>)
favourite sorrow on the day when Wolfe's remains were gloriously buried
at Greenwich. <div class="bookquote">``If our boys could come by such deaths as James's, you
know you wouldn't prevent them from being shot, but would scale the
Abraham heights to see the thing done! Wouldst thou mind dying in
the arms of victory, Charley?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Wolfe</b></font>) asks of the little hero from the
Chartreux. <div class="bookquote">``That I wouldn't,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>says the little man; <div class="bookquote">``and the doctor gave
us a holiday, too.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/>Our Harry's promotion was insured after his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) share in the famous battle,
and our aunt announced her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) intention of purchasing a company for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).




<p/>CHAPTER LXXV. The Course of True Love


<p/>Had your father, young folks, possessed the commonest share of prudence,
not only would this chapter of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) history never have been written, but
you yourselves would never have appeared in the world to plague him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) in
a hundred ways to shout and laugh in the passages when he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) wants to be
quiet at his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) books; to wake him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) is dozing after dinner, as a
healthy country gentleman should: to mislay his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) spectacles for him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>),
and steal away his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) newspaper when he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) wants to read it; to ruin him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) with
tailors' bills, mantua-makers' bills, tutors' bills, as you all of you
do: to break his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) rest of nights when you have the impudence to fall
ill, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) would sleep undisturbed but that your silly mother will
never be quiet for half an hour; and when Joan can't sleep, what use,
pray, is there in Darby putting on his (<font color='blue'><b>Darby</b></font>) nightcap? Every trifling ailment
that any one of you has had, has scared her (<font color='blue'><b>Joan</b></font>) so that I protest I have
never been tranquil; and, were I not the most long-suffering creature in
the world, would have liked to be rid of the whole pack of you. And
now, forsooth, that you have grown out of childhood, long petticoats,
chicken-pox, small-pox, whooping-cough, scarlet fever, and the other
delectable accidents of puerile life, what must that unconscionable
woman propose but to arrange the south rooms as a nursery for possible
grandchildren, and set up the Captain with a wife, and make him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) marry
early because we did! He (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) is too fond, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) says, of Brookes's and
Goosetree's when he (<font color='blue'><b>Brookes</b></font>) is in London. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) has the perversity to hint that,
though an entree to Carlton House may be very pleasant, `tis very
dangerous for a young gentleman: and she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) would have Miles live away from
temptation, and sow his (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) wild oats, and marry, as we did. Marry! my dear
creature, we had no business to marry at all! By the laws of common
prudence and duty, I ought to have backed out of my little engagement
with Miss Theo -LRB-who would have married somebody else-RRB-, and taken a rich
wife. Your Uncle John was a parson and couldn't fight, poor Charley was
a boy at school, and your grandfather was too old a man to call me to
account with sword and pistol. I repeat there never was a more foolish
match in the world than ours, and our relations were perfectly right
in being angry with us. What are relations made for, indeed, but to be
angry and find fault? When Hester marries, do you mind, Master George,
to quarrel with her (<font color='blue'><b>Hester</b></font>) if she (<font color='blue'><b>Hester</b></font>) does not take a husband of your selecting.
When George has got his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) living, after being senior wrangler and fellow
of his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) college, Miss Hester, do you toss up your little nose at the
young lady he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) shall fancy. As for you, my little Theo, I can't part with
your. You must not quit your old father; for he (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) likes you to play Haydn
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>), and peel his (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) walnuts after dinner.


<p/>-LSB-On the blank leaf opposite this paragraph is written, in a large,
girlish hand:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I never intend to go.--THEODOSIA.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nor I.--HESTER.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>They both married, as I see by the note in the family Bible--Miss
Theodosia Warrington to Joseph Clinton, son of the Rev. Joseph Blake,
and himself subsequently Master of Rodwell Regis Grammar School; and
Miss Hester Mary, in 1804, to Captain F. Handyman, R.N.--ED.-RSB-


<p/>Whilst they had the blessing -LRB-forsooth!-RRB- of meeting, and billing and
cooing every day, the two young people, your parents, went on in a
fool's paradise, little heeding the world round about them, and all its
tattling and meddling. Rinaldo was as brave a warrior as ever slew Turk,
but you know he (<font color='blue'><b>Turk</b></font>) loved dangling in Armida's garden. Pray, my Lady Armida,
what did you mean by flinging your spells over me in youth, so that not
glory, not fashion, not gaming-tables, not the society of men of wit in
whose way I fell, could keep me long from your apron-strings, or out of
reach of your dear simple prattle? Pray, my dear, what used we to say to
each other during those endless hours of meeting? I never went to sleep
after dinner then. Which of us was so witty? Was it I or you? And how
came it our conversations were so delightful? I remember that year I did
not even care to go and see my Lord Ferrers tried and hung, when all the
world was running after his (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrers</b></font>) lordship. The King of Prussia's capital
was taken; had the Austrians and Russians been encamped round the Tower
there could scarce have been more stir in London: yet Miss Theo and her (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>)
young gentleman felt no inordinate emotion of pity or indignation. What
to us was the fate of Leipzig or Berlin? The truth is, that dear old
house in Dean Street was an enchanted garden of delights. I have been as
idle since, but never as happy. Shall we order the postchaise, my dear,
leave the children to keep house; and drive up to London and see if the
old lodgings are still to be let? And you shall sit at your old place in
the window, and wave a little handkerchief as I walk up the street. Say
what we did was imprudent. Would we not do it over again? My good folks,
if Venus had walked into the room and challenged the apple, I was so
infatuated, I would have given it your mother. And had she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had the
choice, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) would have preferred her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) humble servant in a threadbare coat
to my Lord Clive with all his (<font color='blue'><b>Clive</b></font>) diamonds.

<p/>Once, to be sure, and for a brief time in that year, I had a notion of
going on the highway in order to be caught and hung as my Lord Ferrers:
or of joining the King of Prussia, and requesting some of his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) Majesty's
enemies to knock my brains out; or of enlisting for the India service,
and performing some desperate exploit which should end in my bodily
destruction. Ah me! that was indeed a dreadful time! Your mother scarce
dares speak of it now, save in a whisper of terror; or think of it--it
was such cruel pain. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was unhappy years after on the anniversary of
the day, until one of you was born on it. Suppose we had been parted:
what had come to us? What had my lot been without her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)? As I think of
that possibility, the whole world is a blank. I do not say were we
parted now. It has pleased God to give us thirty years of union. We have
reached the autumn season. Our successors are appointed and ready; and
that one of us who is first called away, knows the survivor will follow
ere long. But we were actually parted in our youth; and I tremble
to think what might have been, had not a dearest friend brought us
together.

<p/>Unknown to myself, and very likely meaning only my advantage, my
relatives in England had chosen to write to Madam Esmond in Virginia,
and represent what they were pleased to call the folly of the engagement
I had contracted. Every one of them sang the same song: and I saw the
letters, and burned the whole cursed pack of them years afterwards when
my mother showed them to me at home in Virginia. Aunt Bernstein was
forward with her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) advice. A young person, with no wonderful good looks,
of no family, with no money;--was ever such an imprudent connexion, and
ought it not for dear George's sake to be broken off? She (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) had several
eligible matches in view for me. With my name and prospects, `twas a
shame I should throw myself away on this young lady; her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) sister ought to
interpose--and so forth.

<p/>My Lady Warrington must write, too, and in her (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) peculiar manner. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>)
ladyship's letter was garnished with scripture texts.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) dressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) worldliness out in phylacteries. She (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) pointed out how I
was living in an unworthy society of player-folks, and the like people,
who she (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) could not say were absolutely without religion -LRB-Heaven forbid!-RRB-,
but who were deplorably worldly. She (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) would not say an artful woman had
inveigled me for her (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) daughter, having in vain tried to captivate my
younger brother. She (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) was far from saying any harm of the young woman I
had selected; but at least this was certain, Miss L. had no fortune or
expectations, and her (<font color='blue'><b>L.</b></font>) parents might naturally be anxious to compromise
me. She (<font color='blue'><b>L.</b></font>) had taken counsel, etc. etc.. She (<font color='blue'><b>L.</b></font>) had sought for guidance where
it was, etc.. Feeling what her (<font color='blue'><b>L.</b></font>) duty was, she (<font color='blue'><b>L.</b></font>) had determined to speak. Sir
Miles, a man of excellent judgment in the affairs of this world -LRB-though
he (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) knew and sought a better-RRB-, fully agreed with her (<font color='blue'><b>L.</b></font>) in opinion, nay,
desired her (<font color='blue'><b>L.</b></font>) to write, and entreat her (<font color='blue'><b>L.</b></font>) sister to interfere, that the
ill-advised match should not take place.

<p/>And who besides must put a little finger into the pie but the new
Countess of Castlewood? She (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) wrote a majestic letter to Madam Esmond, and
stated, that having been placed by Providence at the head of the Esmond
family, it was her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) duty to communicate with her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) kinswoman and warn her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>)
to break off this marriage. I believe the three women laid their heads
together previously; and, packet after packet, sent off their warnings
to the Virginian lady.

<p/>One raw April morning, as Corydon goes to pay his (<font color='blue'><b>Virginian</b></font>) usual duty to Phillis,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Virginian</b></font>) finds, not his (<font color='blue'><b>Virginian</b></font>) charmer with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) dear smile as usual ready to welcome
him (<font color='blue'><b>Virginian</b></font>), but Mrs. Lambert, with very red eyes, and the General as pale as
death. <div class="bookquote">``Read this, George Warrington!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>says he (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>), as his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) wife's head drops
between her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) hands; and he (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) puts a letter before me, of which I recognised
the handwriting. I can hear now the sobs of the good Aunt Lambert, and
to this day the noise of fire-irons stirring a fire in a room overhead
gives me a tremor. I heard such a noise that day in the girls' room
where the sisters were together. Poor, gentle child! Poor Theo!

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What can I do after this, George, my poor boy?''  (<font color='red'><b>the General pacing</b></font>)</div>asks the General,
pacing the room with desperation in his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) face.

<p/>I did not quite read the whole of Madam Esmond's letter, for a kind of
sickness and faintness came over me; but I fear I could say some of it
now by heart. Its style was good, and its actual words temperate enough,
though they only implied that Mr. and Mrs. Lambert had inveigled me into
the marriage; that they knew such an union was unworthy of me; that -LRB-as
Madam E. understood-RRB- they had desired a similar union for her (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) younger
son, which project, not unluckily for him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>), perhaps, was given up when
it was found that Mr. Henry Warrington was not the inheritor of the
Virginian property. If Mr. Lambert was a man of spirit and honour, as
he (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) was represented to be, Madam Esmond scarcely supposed that, after her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>)
representations, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) would persist in desiring this match. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) would not
lay commands upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) son, whose temper she (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) knew; but for the sake
of Miss Lambert's own reputation and comfort, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) urged that the
dissolution of the engagement should come from her (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) family, and not from
the just unwillingness of Rachel Esmond Warrington of Virginia.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``God help us, George!''  (<font color='red'><b>the General</b></font>)</div>the General said, <div class="bookquote">``and give us all strength to
bear this grief, and these charges which it has pleased your mother
to bring! They are hard, but they don't matter now. What is of most
importance, is to spare as much sorrow as we can to my poor girl. I know
you love her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) so well, that you will help me and her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) mother to make the
blow as tolerable as we may to that poor gentle heart. Since she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was
born she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) has never given pain to a soul alive, and `tis cruel that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
should be made to suffer.''  (<font color='red'><b>the General</b></font>)</div>And as he (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) spoke he (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) passed his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) hand across his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>)
dry eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It was my fault, Martin! It was my fault!''  (<font color='red'><b>the mother</b></font>)</div>weeps the poor mother.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your mother spoke us fair, and gave her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) promise,''  (<font color='red'><b>the father</b></font>)</div>said the father.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And do you think I will withdraw mine?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>cried I; and protested, with
a thousand frantic vows, what they knew full well, that I was bound to
Theo before Heaven, and that nothing should part me from her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>).''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) herself will demand the parting. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) is a good girl, God help me!
and a dutiful. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) will not have her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) father and mother called schemers,
and treated with scorn. Your mother knew not, very likely, what she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was
doing, but `tis done. You may see the child, and she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) will tell you as
much. Is Theo dressed, Molly? I brought the letter home from my office
last evening after you were gone. The women have had a bad night. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
knew at once by my face that there was bad news from America. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) read
the letter quite firmly. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) said she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) would like to see you and say
good-bye. Of course, George, you will give me your word of honour not to
try and see her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) afterwards. As soon as my business will let me we will
get away from this, but mother and I think we are best all together.
`Tis you, perhaps, had best go. But give me your word, at any rate, that
you will not try and see her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). We must spare her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) pain, sir! We must spare
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) pain!''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>And the good man sate down in such deep anguish himself that
I, who was not yet under the full pressure of my own grief, actually
felt his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and pitied it. It could not be that the dear lips I had kissed
yesterday were to speak to me only once more. We were all here together;
loving each other, sitting in the room where we met every day; my
drawing on the table by her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) little workbox; she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was in the chamber
upstairs; she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) must come down presently.

<p/>Who is this opens the door? I see her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) sweet face. It was like our little
Mary's when we thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) would die of the fever. There was even
a smile upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) lips. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) comes up and kisses me. <div class="bookquote">``Good-bye, dear
George!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) says. Great Heaven! An old man sitting in this room,--with
my wife's workbox opposite, and she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) but five minutes away, my eyes
grow so dim and full that I can't see the book before me. I am
three-and-twenty years old again. I go through every stage of that
agony. I once had it sitting in my own postchaise, with my wife actually
by my side. Who dared to sully her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) sweet love with suspicion? Who had a
right to stab such a soft bosom? Don't you see my ladies getting their
knives ready, and the poor child baring it? My wife comes in. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) has
been serving out tea or tobacco to some of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) pensioners. <div class="bookquote">``What is it
makes you look so angry, papa?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) says. <div class="bookquote">``My love!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I say, <div class="bookquote">``it is the
thirteenth of April.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>A pang of pain shoots across her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) face, followed by
a tender smile. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) has undergone the martyrdom, and in the midst of the
pang comes a halo of forgiveness. I can't forgive; not until my days
of dotage come, and I cease remembering anything. <div class="bookquote">``Hal will be home
for Easter; he (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>) will bring two or three of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>) friends with him (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>) from
Cambridge,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) says. And straightway she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) falls to devising schemes for
amusing the boys. When is she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) ever occupied, but with plans for making
others happy?

<p/>A gentleman sitting in spectacles before an old ledger, and writing down
pitiful remembrances of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) own condition, is a quaint and ridiculous
object. My corns hurt me, I know, but I suspect my neighbour's shoes
pinch him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) too. I am not going to howl much over my own grief, or enlarge
at any great length on this one. Many another man, I dare say, has had
the light of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) day suddenly put out, the joy of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) life extinguished,
and has been left to darkness and vague torture. I have a book I tried
to read at this time of grief--Howel's Letters--and when I come to the
part about Prince Charles in Spain, up starts the whole tragedy alive
again. I went to Brighthelmstone, and there, at the inn, had a room
facing the east, and saw the sun get up ever so many mornings, after
blank nights of wakefulness, and smoked my pipe of Virginia in his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) face.
When I am in that place by chance, and see the sun rising now, I shake
my fist at him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>), thinking, O orient Phoebus, what horrible grief and
savage wrath have you not seen me suffer! Though my wife is mine ever so
long, I say I am angry just the same. Who dared, I want to know, to
make us suffer so? I was forbidden to see her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>). I kept my promise, and
remained away from the house: that is, after that horrible meeting and
parting. But at night I would go and look at her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) window, and watch the
lamp burning there; I would go to the Chartreux -LRB-where I knew
another boy-RRB-, and call for her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) brother, and gorge him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) with cakes and
half-crowns. I would meanly have her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) elder brother to dine, and almost
kiss him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) went away. I used to breakfast at a coffee-house in
Whitehall, in order to see Lambert go to his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) office; and we would salute
each other sadly, and pass on without speaking. Why did not the women
come out? They never did. They were practising on her (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>), and persuading
her (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) to try and forget me. Oh, the weary, weary days! Oh, the maddening
time! At last a doctor's chariot used to draw up before the General's
house every day. Was she (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) ill? I fear I was rather glad she (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) was ill. My
own suffering was so infernal, that I greedily wanted her (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) to share
my pain. And would she (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) not? What grief of mine has it not felt, that
gentlest and most compassionate of hearts? What pain would it not suffer
to spare mine a pang?

<p/>I sought that doctor out. I had an interview with him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>). I told my story,
and laid bare my heart to him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>), with an outburst of passionate sincerity,
which won his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) sympathy. My confession enabled him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) to understand his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>)
young patient's malady; for which his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) drugs had no remedy or anodyne. I
had promised not to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>), or to go to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>): I had kept my promise. I
had promised to leave London: I had gone away. Twice, thrice I went back
and told my sufferings to him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) would take my fee now and again, and
always receive me kindly, and let me speak. Ah, how I clung to him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>)! I
suspect he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) must have been unhappy once in his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) own life, he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) knew so well
and gently how to succour the miserable.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) did not tell me how dangerously, though he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) did not disguise from
me how gravely and seriously, my dearest girl had been ill. I told him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>)
everything--that I would marry her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) and brave every chance and danger;
that, without her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), I was a man utterly wrecked and ruined, and cared not
what became of me. My mother had once consented, and had now chosen to
withdraw her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) consent, when the tie between us had been, as I held, drawn
so closely together, as to be paramount to all filial duty.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think, sir, if your mother heard you, and saw Miss Lambert, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) would
relent,''  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>said the doctor. Who was my mother to hold me in bondage; to
claim a right of misery over me; and to take this angel out of my arms?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>) could not,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``be a message-carrier between young ladies who
were pining and young lovers on whom the sweethearts' gates were shut:
but so much he (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>) would venture to say, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>) had seen me, and was
prescribing for me, too.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) must have been unhappy once, himself.
I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>), you may be sure, on the very day when he (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) had kept his (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) promise
to me. He (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) said she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) seemed to be comforted by hearing news of me.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) bears her (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) suffering with an angelical sweetness. I prescribe
Jesuit's bark, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) takes; but I am not sure the hearing of you has
not done more good than the medicine.''  (<font color='red'><b>The women</b></font>)</div>The women owned afterwards that
they had never told the General of the doctor's new patient.

<p/>I know not what wild expressions of gratitude I poured out to the good
doctor for the comfort he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) brought me. His (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) treatment was curing two
unhappy sick persons. `Twas but a drop of water, to be sure; but then
a drop of water to a man raging in torment. I loved the ground he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) trod
upon, blessed the hand that took mine, and had felt her (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) pulse. I had a
ring with a pretty cameo head of a Hercules on it. `Twas too small for
his (<font color='blue'><b>Hercules</b></font>) finger, nor did the good old man wear such ornaments. I made
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hang it to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) watch-chain, in hopes that she (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) might see it, and
recognise that the token came from me. How I fastened upon Spencer
at this time -LRB-my friend of the Temple who also had an unfortunate
love-match-RRB-, and walked with him (<font color='blue'><b>Spencer</b></font>) from my apartments to the Temple, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Spencer</b></font>) back with me to Bedford Gardens, and our talk was for ever about our
women! I dare say I told everybody my grief. My good landlady and Betty
the housemaid pitied me. My son Miles, who, for a wonder, has been
reading in my MS., says, <div class="bookquote">``By Jove, sir, I didn't know you and my mother
were took in this kind of way. The year I joined, I was hit very bad
myself. An infernal little jilt that threw me over for Sir Craven Oaks
of our regiment. I thought I should have gone crazy.''  (<font color='red'><b>Miles/Miles Warrington</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) gives a
melancholy whistle, and walks away.

<p/>The General had to leave London presently on one of his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) military
inspections, as the doctor casually told me; but, having given my
word that I would not seek to present myself at his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) house, I kept it,
availing myself, however, as you may be sure, of the good physician's
leave to visit him (<font color='blue'><b>physician</b></font>), and have news of his (<font color='blue'><b>physician</b></font>) dear patient. His (<font color='blue'><b>physician</b></font>) accounts of
her (<font color='blue'><b>physician</b></font>) were, far from encouraging. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) does not rally,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>physician</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``We must
get her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) back to Kent again, or to the sea.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I did not know then that the
poor child had begged and prayed so piteously not to be moved, that
her (<font color='blue'><b>physician</b></font>) parents, divining, perhaps, the reason of her (<font color='blue'><b>physician</b></font>) desire to linger in
London, and feeling that it might be dangerous not to humour her (<font color='blue'><b>physician</b></font>), had
yielded to her (<font color='blue'><b>physician</b></font>) entreaty, and consented to remain in town.

<p/>At last one morning I came, pretty much as usual, and took my place in
my doctor's front parlour, whence his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) patients were called in their turn
to his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) consulting-room. Here I remained, looking heedlessly over the
books on the table and taking no notice of any person in the room, which
speedily emptied itself of all, save me and one lady who sate with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
veil down. I used to stay till the last, for Osborn, the doctor's man,
knew my business, and that it was not my own illness I came for.

<p/>When the room was empty of all save me and the lady, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) puts out two
little hands, cries in a voice which made me start <div class="bookquote">``Don't you know me,
George?''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>And the next minute I have my arms round her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), and kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
as heartily as ever I kissed in my life, and gave way to a passionate
outgush of emotion the most refreshing, for my parched soul had been in
rage and torture for six weeks past, and this was a glimpse of Heaven.

<p/>Who was it, children? You think it was your mother whom the doctor had
brought to me? No. It was Hetty.




<p/>CHAPTER LXXVI. Informs us how Mr. Warrington jumped into a Landau


<p/>The emotion at the first surprise and greeting over, the little maiden
began at once.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So you are come at last to ask after Theo, and you feel sorry that your
neglect has made her (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) so ill? For six weeks she (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) has been unwell, and you

sure!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Kind!''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>gasps out Mr. Warrington.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose you call it kind to be with her (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) every day and all day for a

gentlemen make these promises, because they wish to keep `em. I wouldn't
trifle with a poor child's heart, and leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) afterwards, if I were a
man. What has she (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) ever done to you, but be a fool and too fond of you?
Pray, sir, by what right do you take her (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) away from all of us, and then
desert her (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>), because an old woman in America don't approve of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)? She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)

ill, that I am glad to see; and I suppose it's your mother you are
frightened of. But I shan't tell Theo that you are unwell. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) hasn't
left off caring for you. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) can't walk out of a room, break her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) solemn
engagements, and go into the world the next day as if nothing had
happened! That is left for men, our superiors in courage and wisdom; and
to desert an angel--yes, an angel ten thousand times too good for you;
an angel who used to love me till she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) saw you, and who was the blessing
of life and of all of us--is what you call honour? Don't tell me, sir!
I despise you all! You are our betters, are you? We are to worship and
wait on you, I suppose? I don't care about your wit, and your tragedies,
and your verses; and I think they are often very stupid. I won't set
up of nights copying your manuscripts, nor watch hour after hour at a
window wasting my time and neglecting everybody because I want to see
your worship walk down the street with your hat cocked! If you are
going away, and welcome, give me back my sister, I say! Give me back my
darling of old days, who loved every one of us, till she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) saw you. And
you leave her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) because your mamma thinks she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) can find somebody richer
for you! Oh, you brave gentleman! Go and marry the person your mother
chooses, and let my dear die here deserted!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Great heavens, Hetty!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I cry, amazed at the logic of the little woman.
<div class="bookquote">``Is it I who wish to leave your sister? Did I not offer to keep my
promise, and was it not your father who refused me, and made me promise
never to try and see her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) again? What have I but my word, and my honour?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Honour, indeed! You keep your word to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), and you break it to her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)!
Pretty honour! If I were a man, I would soon let you know what I thought
of your honour! Only I forgot--you are bound to keep the peace and
mustn't... Oh, George, George! Don't you see the grief I am in? I am
distracted, and scarce know what I say. You must not leave my darling.
They don't know it at home. They don't think so but I know her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) best of
all, and she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) will die if you leave her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>). Say you won't! Have pity upon
me, Mr. Warrington, and give me my dearest back!''  (<font color='red'><b>the creature</b></font>)</div>Thus the warm-hearted,
distracted creature ran from anger to entreaty, from scorn to tears. Was
my little doctor right in thus speaking of the case of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) dear patient?
Was there no other remedy than that which Hetty cried for? Have not
others felt the same cruel pain of amputation, undergone the same
exhaustion and fever afterwards, lain hopeless of anything save death,
and yet recovered after all, and limped through life subsequently? Why,
but that love is selfish, and does not heed other people's griefs and
passions, or that ours was so intense and special that we deemed no
other lovers could suffer like ourselves;--here in the passionate young
pleader for her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) sister, we might have shown an instance that a fond
heart could be stricken with the love malady and silently suffer it,
live under it, recover from it. What had happened in Hetty's own case?
Her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) sister and I, in our easy triumph and fond confidential prattle, had
many a time talked over that matter, and, egotists as we were, perhaps
drawn a secret zest and security out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) less fortunate attachment.
`Twas like sitting by the fireside and hearing the winter howling
without; `twas like walking by the maxi magno, and seeing the ship
tossing at sea. We clung to each other only the more closely, and,
wrapped in our own happiness, viewed others' misfortunes with complacent
pity. Be the truth as it may. Grant that we might have been sundered,
and after a while survived the separation, so much my sceptical old age
may be disposed to admit. Yet, at that time, I was eager enough to share
my ardent little Hetty's terrors and apprehensions, and willingly chose
to believe that the life dearest to me in the world would be sacrificed
if separated from mine. Was I wrong? I would not say as much now. I may
doubt about myself -LRB-or not doubt, I know-RRB-, but of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>), never; and Hetty
found in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) quite a willing sharer in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) alarms and terrors. I was for
imparting some of these to our doctor; but the good gentleman shut my
mouth. <div class="bookquote">``Hush,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>says he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>), with a comical look of fright. <div class="bookquote">``I must hear none
of this. If two people who happen to know each other chance to meet and
talk in my patients' room, I cannot help myself; but as for match-making
and love-making, I am your humble servant! What will the General do when
he (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) comes back to town? He (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) will have me behind Montagu House as sure as I
am a live doctor, and alive I wish to remain, my good sir!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) skips
into his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) carriage, and leaves me there meditating. <div class="bookquote">``And you and Miss
Hetty must have no meetings here again, mind you that,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had said
previously.

<p/>Oh no! Of course we would have none! We are gentlemen of honour, and so
forth, and our word is our word. Besides, to have seen Hetty, was not
that an inestimable boon, and would we not be for ever grateful? I am
so refreshed with that drop of water I have had, that I think I can hold
out for ever so long a time now. I walk away with Hetty to Soho, and
never once thought of arranging a new meeting with her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>). But the little
emissary was more thoughtful, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) asks me whether I go to the
Museum now to read? And I say, <div class="bookquote">``Oh yes, sometimes, my dear; but I am too
wretched for reading now; I cannot see what is on the paper. I do not
care about my books. Even Pocahontas is wearisome to me. I...''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I
might have continued ever so much further, when, <div class="bookquote">``Nonsense!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) says,
stamping her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) little foot. <div class="bookquote">``Why, I declare, George, you are more stupid
than Harry!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How do you mean, my dear child?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``When do you go? You go away at three o’clock. You strike across on the
road to Tottenham Court. You walk through the village, and return by the
Green Lane that leads back towards the new hospital. You know you do! If
you walk for a week there, it can't do you any harm. Good morning, sir!
You'll please not follow me any farther.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) drops me a curtsey,
and walks away with a veil over her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) face.

<p/>That Green Lane, which lay to the north of the new hospital, is built
all over with houses now. In my time, when good old George II. was yet
king, `twas a shabby rural outlet of London; so dangerous, that the City
folks who went to their villas and junketing houses at Hampstead and the
outlying villages, would return in parties of nights, and escorted by
waiters with lanthorns, to defend them from the footpads who prowled
about the town outskirts. Hampstead and Highgate churches, each crowning
its hill, filled up the background of the view which you saw as
you turned your back to London; and one, two, three days Mr. George
Warrington had the pleasure of looking upon this landscape, and walking
back in the direction of the new hospital.

<p/>Along the lane were sundry small houses of entertainment; and I remember
at one place, where they sold cakes and beer, at the sign of the
Protestant Hero, a decent woman smiling at me on the third or fourth
day, and curtseying in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) clean apron, as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) says, <div class="bookquote">``It appears the
lady don't come, sir! Your honour had best step in, and take a can of my
cool beer.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>At length, as I am coming back through Tottenham Road, on the 25th of
May--O day to be marked with the whitest stone!--a little way beyond Mr.
Whitefield's Tabernacle, I see a landau before me, and on the box-seat
by the driver is my young friend Charley, who waves his (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) hat to me and
calls out, <div class="bookquote">``George! George!''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>I ran up to the carriage, my knees knocking
together so that I thought I should fall by the wheel; and inside I see
Hetty, and by her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) my dearest Theo, propped with a pillow. How thin the
little hand had become since last it was laid in mine! The cheeks were
flushed and wasted, the eyes strangely bright, and the thrill of the
voice when she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) spoke a word or two, smote me with a pang, I know not of
grief or joy was it, so intimately were they blended.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am taking her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) an airing to Hampstead,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hetty/Miss Hetty/Lambert</b></font>)</div>says Hetty, demurely. <div class="bookquote">``The
doctor says the air will do her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) good.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have been ill, but I am better now, George,''  (<font color='red'><b>Theo/Lady Theo</b></font>)</div>says Theo. There came a
great burst of music from the people in the chapel hard by, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) was
speaking. I held her (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) hand in mine. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) eyes were looking into mine once
more. It seemed as if we had never been parted.

<p/>I can never forget the tune of that psalm. I have heard it all through
my life. My wife has touched it on her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) harpsichord, and her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) little ones
have warbled it. Now, do you understand, young people, why I love it so?
Because `twas the music played at our amoris redintegratio. Because it
sang hope to me, at the period of my existence the most miserable. Yes,
the most miserable: for that dreary confinement of Duquesne had its
tendernesses and kindly associations connected with it; and many a time
in after days I have thought with fondness of the poor Biche and my
tipsy jailor, and the reveille of the forest birds and the military
music of my prison.

<p/>Master Charley looks down from his (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) box-seat upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) sister and me
engaged in beatific contemplation, and Hetty listening too, to the
music. <div class="bookquote">``I think I should like to go and hear it. And that famous Mr.
Whitfield, perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Whitfield</b></font>) is going to preach this very day! Come in with me,
Charley--and George can drive for half an hour with dear Theo towards
Hampstead and back.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charley</b></font>)</div><p/>Charley did not seem to have any very strong desire for witnessing the
devotional exercises of good Mr. Whitfield and his (<font color='blue'><b>Whitfield</b></font>) congregation, and
proposed that George Warrington should take Hetty in; but Het was not
to be denied. <div class="bookquote">``I will never help you in another exercise as long as you
live, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hetty/Miss Hetty/Lambert</b></font>)</div>cries Miss Hetty, <div class="bookquote">``if you don't come on,'' (<font color='red'><b>Hetty/Miss Hetty/Lambert</b></font>)</div>--while the youth
clambered down from his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) box-seat, and they entered the temple together.

<p/>Can any moralist, bearing my previous promises in mind, excuse me for
jumping into the carriage and sitting down once more by my dearest Theo?
Suppose I did break `em? Will he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) blame me much? Reverend sir, you are
welcome. I broke my promise; and if you would not do as much, good
friend, you are welcome to your virtue. Not that I for a moment suspect
my own children will ever be so bold as to think of having hearts of
their own, and bestowing them according to their liking. No, my young
people, you will let papa choose for you; be hungry when he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) tells
you; be thirsty when he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) orders; and settle your children's marriages
afterwards.

<p/>And now of course you are anxious to hear what took place when papa
jumped into the landau by the side of poor little mamma, propped up by
her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) pillows. <div class="bookquote">``I am come to your part of the story, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>says I,
looking over to my wife as she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) is plying her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) needles.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``To what, pray?''  (<font color='red'><b>lady</b></font>)</div>says my lady. <div class="bookquote">``You should skip all that part, and come
to the grand battles, and your heroic defence of--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of Fort Fiddlededee in the year 1778, when I pulled off Mr.
Washington's epaulet, gouged General Gates's eye, cut off Charles Lee's
head, and pasted it on again!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Let us hear all about the fighting,''  (<font color='red'><b>the boys</b></font>)</div>say the boys. Even the Captain
condescends to own he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) will listen to any military details, though only
from a militia officer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Fair and softly, young people! Everything in its turn. I am not yet
arrived at the war. I am only a young gentleman, just stepping into
a landau, by the side of a young lady whom I promised to avoid. I am
taking her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) hand, which, after a little ado, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) leaves in mine. Do you
remember how hot it was, the little thing, how it trembled, and how it
throbbed and jumped a hundred and twenty in a minute? And as we trot on
towards Hampstead, I address Miss Lambert in the following terms--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, ah, ah!''  (<font color='red'><b>the girls governess</b></font>)</div>say the girls in a chorus with mademoiselle, their French
governess, who cries, <div class="bookquote">``Nous ecoutons maintenant. La parole est a vous,
Monsieur le Chevalier!''

 (<font color='red'><b>governess</b></font>)</div><p/>Here we have them all in a circle: mamma is at her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) side of the fire,
papa at his (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>); Mademoiselle Eleonore, at whom the Captain looks rather
sweetly -LRB-eyes off, Captain!-RRB-; the two girls, listening like--like
nymphas discentes to Apollo, let us say; and John and Tummas -LRB-with
obtuse ears-RRB-, who are bringing in the tea-trays and urns.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very good,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Squire</b></font>)</div>says the Squire, pulling out the MS., and waving it before
him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``We are going to tell your mother's secrets and mine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sure you may, papa,''  (<font color='red'><b>the house matron</b></font>)</div>cries the house matron. <div class="bookquote">``There's nothing to
be ashamed of.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>And a blush rises over her (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>) kind face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But before I begin, young folks, permit me two or three questions.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Allons, toujours des questions!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>says mademoiselle, with a shrug of her (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>)
pretty shoulders. -LRB-Florac has recommended her (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>) to us, and I suspect the
little Chevalier has himself an eye upon this pretty Mademoiselle de
Blois.-RRB-

<p/>To the questions, then.




<p/>CHAPTER LXXVII. And how everybody got out again


<p/>You, Captain Miles Warrington, have the honour of winning the good
graces of a lady--of ever so many ladies--of the Duchess of Devonshire,
let us say, of Mrs. Crew, of Mrs. Fitzherbert, of the Queen of Prussia,
of the Goddess Venus, of Mademoiselle Hillisberg of the Opera--never
mind of whom, in fine. If you win a lady's good graces, do you always go
to the mess and tell what happened?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not such a fool, Squire!''  (<font color='red'><b>the Captain</b></font>)</div>says the Captain, surveying his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) side curl in
the glass.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you, Miss Theo, told your mother every word you said to Mr. Joe
Blake, junior, in the shrubbery this morning?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Joe Blake, indeed!''  (<font color='red'><b>Theo</b></font>)</div>cries Theo junior.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And you, mademoiselle? That scented billet which came to you under Sir
Thomas's frank, have you told us all the letter contains? Look how she (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>)
blushes! As red as the curtain, on my word! No, mademoiselle, we all
have our secrets''  (<font color='red'><b>the Squire</b></font>)</div>-LRB-says the Squire, here making his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) best French bow-RRB-.
<div class="bookquote">``No, Theo, there was nothing in the shrubbery--only nuts, my child!
No, Miles, my son, we don't tell all, even to the most indulgent of
fathers--and if I tell what happened in a landau on the Hampstead Road,
on the 25th of May, 1760, may the Chevalier Ruspini pull out every tooth
in my head!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pray tell, papa!''  (<font color='red'><b>mamma</b></font>)</div>cries mamma: <div class="bookquote">``or, as Jobson, who drove us, is in your
service now, perhaps you will have him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) in from the stables! I insist
upon your telling!''

 (<font color='red'><b>mamma</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What is, then, this mystery?''  (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div>asks mademoiselle, in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) pretty French
accent, of my wife.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Eh, ma fille!''  (<font color='red'><b>whispers the lady</b></font>)</div>whispers the lady. <div class="bookquote">``Thou wouldst ask me what I said? I
said `Yes!'--behold all I said.''  (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div>And so `tis my wife has peached, and
not I; and this was the sum of our conversation, as the carriage, all
too swiftly as I thought, galloped towards Hampstead, and flew
back again. Theo had not agreed to fly in the face of her (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) honoured
parents--no such thing. But we would marry no other person; no, not if
we lived to be as old as Methuselah; no, not the Prince of Wales
himself would she (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) take. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) heart she (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) had given away with her (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) papa's
consent--nay, order--it was not hers to resume. So kind a father must
relent one of these days; and, if George would keep his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) promise--were it
now, or were it in twenty years, or were it in another world, she (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) knew
she (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) should never break hers.

<p/>Hetty's face beamed with delight when, my little interview over, she (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>)
saw Theo's countenance wearing a sweet tranquillity. All the doctor's
medicine has not done her (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) so much good, the fond sister said. The girls
went home after their act of disobedience. I gave up the place which I
had held during a brief period of happiness by my dear invalid's side.
Hetty skipped back into her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) seat, and Charley on to his (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) box. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) told me
in after days, that it was a very dull, stupid sermon he (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) had heard. The
little chap was too orthodox to love dissenting preachers' sermons.

<p/>Hetty was not the only one of the family who remarked her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) sister's
altered countenance and improved spirits. I am told that on the girls'
return home their mother embraced both of them, especially the invalid,
with more than common ardour of affection. <div class="bookquote">``There was nothing like a
country ride,''  (<font color='red'><b>Aunt Lambert</b></font>)</div>Aunt Lambert said, <div class="bookquote">``for doing her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) dear Theo good. She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)
had been on the road to Hampstead, had she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)? She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) must have another ride
to-morrow. Heaven be blessed, my Lord Wrotham's horses were at their
orders three or four times a week, and the sweet child might have the
advantage of them!''  (<font color='red'><b>Aunt Lambert</b></font>)</div>As for the idea that Mr. Warrington might have
happened to meet the children on their drive, Aunt Lambert never once
entertained it,--at least spoke of it. I leave anybody who is interested
in the matter to guess whether Mrs. Lambert could by any possibility
have supposed that her (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) daughter and her (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) sweetheart could ever have come
together again. Do women help each other in love perplexities? Do women
scheme, intrigue, make little plans, tell little fibs, provide little
amorous opportunities, hang up the rope-ladder, coax, wheedle, mystify
the guardian or Abigail, and turn their attention away while Strephon
and Chloe are billing and cooing in the twilight, or whisking off in the
postchaise to Gretna Green? My dear young folks, some people there are
of this nature; and some kind souls who have loved tenderly and truly in
their own time, continue ever after to be kindly and tenderly disposed
towards their young successors, when they begin to play the same pretty
game.

<p/>Miss Prim doesn't. If she (<font color='blue'><b>Chloe</b></font>) hears of two young persons attached to each
other, it is to snarl at them for fools, or to imagine of them all
conceivable evil. Because she (<font color='blue'><b>Chloe</b></font>) has a hump-back herself, she (<font color='blue'><b>Chloe</b></font>) is for biting
everybody else's. I believe if she (<font color='blue'><b>Chloe</b></font>) saw a pair of turtles cooing in a
wood, she (<font color='blue'><b>Chloe</b></font>) would turn her (<font color='blue'><b>Chloe</b></font>) eyes down, or fling a stone to frighten them;
but I am speaking, you see, young ladies, of your grandmother, Aunt
Lambert, who was one great syllabub of human kindness; and, besides,
about the affair at present under discussion, how am I ever to tell
whether she (<font color='blue'><b>grandmother</b></font>) knew anything regarding it or not?

<p/>So, all she (<font color='blue'><b>grandmother</b></font>) says to Theo on her (<font color='blue'><b>grandmother</b></font>) return home is, <div class="bookquote">``My child, the country
air has done you all the good in the world, and I hope you will take
another drive to-morrow, and another, and another, and so on.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Theo/Lady Theo</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't you think, papa, the ride has done the child most wonderful good,
and must not she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) be made to go out in the air?''  (<font color='red'><b>Aunt</b></font>)</div>Aunt Lambert asks of the
General, when he (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) comes in for supper.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sure, if a coach-and-six will do his (<font color='blue'><b>My</b></font>) little Theo good, she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) shall
have it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hetty/Miss Hetty/Lambert</b></font>)</div>Lambert says, <div class="bookquote">``or he (<font color='blue'><b>My</b></font>) will drag the landau up Hampstead Hill
himself, if there are no horses;''  (<font color='red'><b>Hetty/Miss Hetty/Lambert</b></font>)</div>and so the good man would have spent,
freely, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) guineas, or his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) breath, or his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) blood, to give his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) child
pleasure. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was charmed at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) girl's altered countenance; she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) picked
a bit of chicken with appetite: she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) drank a little negus, which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) made
for her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>): indeed it did seem to be better than the kind doctor's best
medicine, which hitherto, God wot, had been of little benefit. Mamma was
gracious and happy. Hetty was radiant and rident. It was quite like an
evening at home at Oakhurst. Never for months past, never since that
fatal, cruel day, that no one spoke of, had they spent an evening so
delightful.

<p/>But, if the other women chose to coax and cajole the good, simple
father, Theo herself was too honest to continue for long even that sweet
and fond delusion. When, for the third or fourth time, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) comes back to
the delightful theme of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) daughter's improved health, and asks, <div class="bookquote">``What
has done it? Is it the country air? is it the Jesuit's bark? is it the
new medicine?''

 (<font color='red'><b>daughter</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Can't you think, dear, what it is?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) says, laying a hand upon her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>)
father's, with a tremor in her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) voice, perhaps, but eyes that are quite
open and bright.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And what is it, my child?''  (<font color='red'><b>the General</b></font>)</div>asks the General.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is because I have seen him (<font color='blue'><b>My</b></font>) again, papa!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) says.

<p/>The other two women turned pale, and Theo's heart too begins to
palpitate, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) cheek to whiten, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) continues to look in her (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>)
father's scared face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It was not wrong to see him (<font color='blue'><b>My</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) continues, more quickly; <div class="bookquote">``it would
have been wrong not to tell you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Great God!''  (<font color='red'><b>the father</b></font>)</div>groans the father, drawing his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) hand back, and with such
a dreadful grief in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) countenance, that Hetty runs to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) almost
swooning sister, clasps her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) heart, and cries out, rapidly, <div class="bookquote">``Theo
knew nothing of it, sir! It was my doing--it was all my doing!''

 (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div><p/>Theo lies on her (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) sister's neck, and kisses it twenty, fifty times.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Women, women! are you playing with my honour?''  (<font color='red'><b>the father</b></font>)</div>cries the father,
bursting out with a fierce exclamation.

<p/>Aunt Lambert sobs, wildly, <div class="bookquote">``Martin! Martin! Don't say a word to her (<font color='blue'><b>women</b></font>)!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hetty/Miss Hetty/Lambert</b></font>)</div>again calls out Hetty, and falls back herself staggering towards the
wall, for Theo has fainted on her (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) shoulder.

<p/>I was taking my breakfast next morning, with what appetite I might, when
my door opens, and my faithful black announces, <div class="bookquote">``General Lambert.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>At
once I saw, by the General's face, that the yesterday's transaction was
known to him (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Your accomplices did not confess,''  (<font color='red'><b>the General</b></font>)</div>the General said,
as soon as my servant had left us, <div class="bookquote">``but sided with you against their
father--a proof how desirable clandestine meetings are. It was from Theo
herself I heard that she (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) had seen you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>servant</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Accomplices, sir!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said -LRB-perhaps not unwilling to turn the
conversation from the real point at issue-RRB-. <div class="bookquote">``You know how fondly and
dutifully your young people regard their father. If they side against
you in this instance, it must be because justice is against you. A man
like you is not going to set up sic volo sic jubeo as the sole law in
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) family!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Psha, George!''  (<font color='red'><b>the General</b></font>)</div>cries the General. <div class="bookquote">``For though we are parted, God forbid
I should desire that we should cease to love each other. I had your
promise that you would not seek to see her (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nor did I go to her (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>), sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said, turning red, no doubt; for though
this was truth, I own it was untrue.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You mean she (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) was brought to you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Theo/Lady Theo</b></font>)</div>says Theo's father, in great
agitation. <div class="bookquote">``Is it behind Hester's petticoat that you will shelter
yourself? What a fine defence for a gentleman!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I won't screen myself behind the poor child,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I replied.
<div class="bookquote">``To speak as I did was to make an attempt at evasion, and I am
ill-accustomed to dissemble. I did not infringe the letter of my
agreement, but I acted against the spirit of it. From this moment I
annul it altogether.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You break your word given to me!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lambert</b></font>)</div>cries Mr. Lambert.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I recall a hasty promise made on a sudden at a moment of extreme
excitement and perturbation. No man can be for ever bound by words
uttered at such a time; and, what is more, no man of honour or humanity,
Mr. Lambert, would try to bind him (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dishonour to me! sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>the General</b></font>)</div>exclaims the General.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, if the phrase is to be shuttlecocked between us!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I answered,
hotly. <div class="bookquote">``There can be no question about love, or mutual regard,
or difference of age, when that word is used: and were you my own
father--and I love you better than a father, Uncle Lambert,--I would not
bear it! What have I done? I have seen the woman whom I consider my wife
before God and man, and if she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) calls me I will see her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) again. If she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
comes to me, here is my home for her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), and the half of the little I have.
`Tis you, who have no right, having made me the gift, to resume it.
Because my mother taunts you unjustly, are you to visit Mrs. Esmond's
wrong upon this tender, innocent creature? You profess to love your
daughter, and you can't bear a little wounded pride for her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) sake. Better
she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) should perish away in misery, than an old woman in Virginia should
say that Mr. Lambert had schemed to marry one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) daughters. Say
that to satisfy what you call honour and I call selfishness, we part,
we break our hearts well nigh, we rally, we try to forget each other, we
marry elsewhere? Can any man be to my dear as I have been? God forbid!
Can any woman be to me what she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is? You shall marry her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to the Prince of
Wales to-morrow, and it is a cowardice and treason. How can we, how can
you, undo the promises we have made to each other before Heaven? You may
part us: and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) will die as surely as if she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) were Jephthah's daughter.
Have you made any vow to Heaven to compass her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) murder? Kill her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) if you
conceive your promise so binds you: but this I swear, that I am glad
you have come, so that I may here formally recall a hasty pledge which I
gave, and that, call me when she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) will, I will come to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div><p/>No doubt this speech was made with the flurry and agitation belonging
to Mr. Warrington's youth, and with the firm conviction that death would
infallibly carry off one or both of the parties, in case their worldly
separation was inevitably decreed. Who does not believe his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) first
passion eternal? Having watched the world since, and seen the rise,
progress, and--alas, that I must say it!--decay of other amours, I may
smile now as I think of my own youthful errors and ardours; but, if it
be a superstition, I had rather hold it; I had rather think that
neither of us could have lived with any other mate, and that, of all its
innumerable creatures, Heaven decreed these special two should be joined
together.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We must come, then, to what I had fain have spared myself,''  (<font color='red'><b>the General</b></font>)</div>says the
General, in reply to my outbreak; <div class="bookquote">``to an unfriendly separation. When
I meet you, Mr. Warrington, I must know you no more. I must order--and
they will not do other than obey me--my family and children not to
recognise you when they see you, since you will not recognise in
your intercourse with me the respect due to my age, the courtesy of
gentlemen. I had hoped so far from your sense of honour, and the idea
I had formed of you, that, in my present great grief and perplexity,
I should have found you willing to soothe and help me as far as you
might--for, God knows, I have need of everybody's sympathy. But, instead
of help, you fling obstacles in my way. Instead of a friend--a gracious
Heaven pardon me!--I find in you an enemy! An enemy to the peace of my
home and the honour of my children, sir! And as such I shall treat you,
and know how to deal with you, when you molest me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the General</b></font>)</div><p/>And, waving his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) hand to me, and putting on his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) hat, Mr. Lambert hastily
quitted my apartment.

<p/>I was confounded, and believed, indeed, there was war between us. The
brief happiness of yesterday was clouded over and gone, and I thought
that never since the day of the first separation had I felt so
exquisitely unhappy as now, when the bitterness of quarrel was added to
the pangs of parting, and I stood not only alone but friendless. In the
course of one year's constant intimacy I had come to regard Lambert with
a reverence and affection which I had never before felt for any mortal
man except my dearest Harry. That his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) face should be turned from me
in anger was as if the sun had gone out of my sphere, and all was dark
around me. And yet I felt sure that in withdrawing the hasty promise I
had made not to see Theo, I was acting rightly--that my fidelity to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>),
as hers now to me, was paramount to all other ties of duty or obedience,
and that, ceremony or none, I was hers, first and before all. Promises
were passed between us, from which no parent could absolve either; and
all the priests in Christendom could no more than attest and confirm the
sacred contract which had tacitly been ratified between us.

<p/>I saw Jack Lambert by chance that day, as I went mechanically to my not
unusual haunt, the library of the new Museum; and with the impetuousness
of youth, and eager to impart my sorrow to some one, I took him (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) out of
the room and led him (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) about the gardens, and poured out my grief to him (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>).
I did not much care for Jack -LRB-who in truth was somewhat of a prig, and
not a little pompous and wearisome with his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) Latin quotations-RRB- except in
the time of my own sorrow, when I would fasten upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) or any one; and
having suffered himself in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) affair with the little American,
being haud ignarus mali -LRB-as I knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) would say-RRB-, I found the college
gentleman ready to compassionate another's misery. I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>), what has
here been represented at greater length, of my yesterday's meeting
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) sister; of my interview with his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) father in the morning; of my
determination at all hazards never to part with Theo. When I found from
the various quotations from the Greek and Latin authors which he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) uttered
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) leaned to my side in the dispute, I thought him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) a man of great
sense, clung eagerly to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) elbow, and bestowed upon him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) much more
affection than he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was accustomed at other times to have from me. I
walked with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) up to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) father's lodgings in Dean Street; saw him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
enter at the dear door; surveyed the house from without with a sickening
desire to know from its exterior appearance how my beloved fared within;
and called for a bottle at the coffee-house where I waited Jack's
return. I called him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) Brother when I sent him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) away. I fondled him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) as the
condemned wretch at Newgate hangs about the jailor or the parson, or any
one who is kind to him (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) misery. I drank a whole bottle of wine at
the coffee-house--by the way, Jack's Coffee-House was its name--called
another. I thought Jack would never come back.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) appeared at length with rather a scared face; and, coming to my box,
poured out for himself two or three bumpers from my second bottle,
and then fell to his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) story, which, to me at least, was not a little
interesting. My poor Theo was keeping her (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) room, it appeared, being much
agitated by the occurrences of yesterday; and Jack had come home in time
to find dinner on table; after which his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) good father held forth upon the
occurrences of the morning, being anxious and able to speak more freely,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) said, because his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) eldest son was present and Theodosia was not in the
room. The General stated what had happened at my lodgings between me and
him (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) bade Hester be silent, who indeed was as dumb as a mouse, poor
thing! he (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) told Aunt Lambert -LRB-who was indulging in that madefaction of
pocket-handkerchiefs which I have before described-RRB-, and with something
like an imprecation, that the women were all against him (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>), and pimps -LRB-he (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>)
called them-RRB- for one another; and frantically turning round to Jack,
asked what was his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) view in the matter?

<p/>To his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) father's surprise and his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) mother's and sister's delight,
Jack made a speech on my side. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) ruled with me -LRB-citing what ancient
authorities I don't know-RRB-, that the matter had gone out of the hands of
the parents on either side; that having given their consent, some months
previously, the elders had put themselves out of court. Though he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) did
not hold with a great, a respectable, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) might say a host of divines,
those sacramental views of the marriage-ceremony--for which there was a
great deal to be said--yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) held it, if possible, even more sacredly
than they; conceiving that though marriages were made before the civil
magistrate, and without the priest, yet they were, before Heaven,
binding and indissoluble.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is not merely, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Morris/Mr. Morris</b></font>)</div>says Jack, turning to his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) father, <div class="bookquote">``those whom
I, John Lambert, Priest, have joined, let no man put asunder; it is
those whom God has joined let no man separate.''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>-LRB-Here he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) took off his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>)
hat, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) told the story to me.-RRB- <div class="bookquote">``My views are clear upon the point,
and surely these young people were joined, or permitted to plight
themselves to each other by the consent of you, the priest of your own
family. My views, I say, are clear, and I will lay them down at length
in a series of two or three discourses which, no doubt, will satisfy
you. Upon which,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Morris/Mr. Morris</b></font>)</div>says Jack, ``my father said, `I am satisfied already,
my dear boy,' and my lively little Het -LRB-who has much archness-RRB- whispers
to me, `Jack, mother and I will make you a dozen shirts, as sure as eggs
is eggs.'''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Whilst we were talking,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lambert</b></font>)</div>Mr. Lambert resumed, ``my sister Theodosia
made her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) appearance, I must say very much agitated and pale, kissed our
father, and sate down at his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) side, and took a sippet of toast---LRB-my dear
George, this port is excellent, and I drink your health-RRB---and took a
sippet of toast and dipped it in his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) negus.

<p/>```You should have been here to hear Jack's sermon!' says Hester. `He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) has
been preaching most beautifully.'

<p/>```Has he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>)?' asks Theodosia, who is too languid and weak, poor thing, much
to care for the exercises of eloquence, or the display of authorities,
such as I must own,'' says Jack, ``it was given to me this afternoon to
bring forward.

<p/>```He (<font color='blue'><b>Theodosia</b></font>) has talked for three quarters of an hour by Shrewsbury clock,' says
my father, though I certainly had not talked so long or half so long
by my own watch. `And his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) discourse has been you, my dear,' says papa,
playing with Theodosia's hand.

<p/>```Me, papa?'

<p/>```You and--and Mr. Warrington--and--and George, my love,' says papa.
Upon which'' -LRB-says Mr. Jack-RRB-. ``my sister came closer to the General, and
laid her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) head upon him (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>), and wept upon his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) shoulder.

<p/>```This is different, sir,' says I, `to a passage I remember in
Pausanias.'

<p/>```In Pausanias? Indeed!' said the General. `And pray who was he (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>)?'

<p/>``I smiled at my father's simplicity in exposing his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) ignorance before his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
children. `When Ulysses was taking away Penelope from her (<font color='blue'><b>Penelope</b></font>) father,
the king hastened after his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) daughter and bridegroom, and besought his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>)
darling to return. Whereupon, it is related, Ulysses offered her (<font color='blue'><b>Penelope</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>Penelope</b></font>)
choice,--whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Penelope</b></font>) would return, or go on with him (<font color='blue'><b>Ulysses</b></font>)? Upon which the
daughter of Icarius covered her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) face with her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) veil. For want of a veil
my sister has taken refuge in your waistcoat, sir,' I said, and we all
laughed; though my mother vowed that if such a proposal had been made
to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), or Penelope had been a girl of spirit, she (<font color='blue'><b>Penelope</b></font>) would have gone home
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Penelope</b></font>) father that instant.

<p/>```But I am not a girl of any spirit, dear mother!' says Theodosia, still
in gremio patris. I do not remember that this habit of caressing
was frequent in my own youth,'' continues Jack. <div class="bookquote">``But after some more
discourse, Brother Warrington! bethought me of you, and left my parents
insisting upon Theodosia returning to bed. The late transactions have,
it appears, weakened and agitated her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) much. I myself have experienced,
in my own case, how full of solliciti timoris is a certain passion; how
it racks the spirits; and I make no doubt, if carried far enough, or
indulged to the extent to which women who have little philosophy will
permit it to go--I make no doubt, I say, is ultimately injurious to the
health. My service to you, brother!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>From grief to hope, how rapid the change was! What a flood of happiness
poured into my soul, and glowed in my whole being! Landlord, more port!
Would honest Jack have drunk a binful I would have treated him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>); and,
to say truth, Jack's sympathy was large in this case, and it had been
generous all day. I decline to score the bottles of port: and place
to the fabulous computations of interested waiters, the amount scored
against me in the reckoning. Jack was my dearest, best of brothers.
My friendship for him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) I swore should be eternal. If I could do him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) any
service, were it a bishopric, by George! he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) should have it. He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) says I
was interrupted by the watchman rhapsodising verses beneath the loved
one's window. I know not. I know I awoke joyfully and rapturously, in
spite of a racking headache the next morning.

<p/>Nor did I know the extent of my happiness quite, or the entire
conversion of my dear noble enemy of the previous morning. It must
have been galling to the pride of an elder man to have to yield to
representations and objections couched in language so little dutiful as
that I had used towards Mr. Lambert. But the true Christian gentleman,
retiring from his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) talk with me, mortified and wounded by my asperity of
remonstrance, as well as by the pain which he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) saw his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) beloved daughter
suffer, went thoughtfully and sadly to his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) business, as he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) subsequently
told me, and in the afternoon -LRB-as his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) custom not unfrequently was-RRB- into
a church which was open for prayers. And it was here, on his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) knees,
submitting his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) case in the quarter whither he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) frequently, though
privately, came for guidance and comfort, that it seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) that his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
child was right in her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) persistent fidelity to me, and himself wrong in
demanding her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) utter submission. Hence Jack's cause was won almost before
he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) began to plead it; and the brave, gentle heart, which could bear no
rancour, which bled at inflicting pain on those it loved, which even
shrank from asserting authority or demanding submission, was only too
glad to return to its natural pulses of love and affection.




<p/>CHAPTER LXXVIII. Pyramus and Thisbe


<p/>In examining the old papers at home, years afterwards, I found, docketed
and labelled with my mother's well-known neat handwriting, <div class="bookquote">``From London,
April, 1760. My son's dreadful letter.''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>When it came to be mine I
burnt the document, not choosing that that story of domestic grief and
disunion should remain amongst our family annals for future Warringtons
to gaze on, mayhap, and disobedient sons to hold up as examples of
foregone domestic rebellions. For similar reasons, I have destroyed the
paper which my mother despatched to me at this time of tyranny, revolt,
annoyance, and irritation.

<p/>Maddened by the pangs of separation from my mistress, and not unrightly
considering that Mrs. Esmond was the prime cause of the greatest grief
and misery which had ever befallen me in the world, I wrote home to
Virginia a letter, which might have been more temperate, it is true, but
in which I endeavoured to maintain the extremest respect and reticence.
I said I did not know by what motives she (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) had been influenced, but that
I held her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) answerable for the misery of my future life, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>)
had chosen wilfully to mar and render wretched. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) had occasioned a
separation between me and a virtuous and innocent young creature,
whose own hopes, health, and happiness were cast down for ever by Mrs.
Esmond's interference. The deed was done, as I feared, and I would offer
no comment upon the conduct of the perpetrator, who was answerable to
God alone; but I did not disguise from my mother that the injury which
she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had done me was so dreadful and mortal, that her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) life or mine could
never repair it; that the tie of my allegiance was broken towards her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>),
and that I never could be, as heretofore, her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) dutiful and respectful
son.

<p/>Madam Esmond replied to me in a letter of very great dignity -LRB-her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) style
and correspondence were extraordinarily elegant and fine-RRB-. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) uttered
not a single reproach or hard word, but coldly gave me to understand
that it was before that awful tribunal of God she (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) had referred the case
between us, and asked for counsel; that, in respect of her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) own conduct,
as a mother, she (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) was ready, in all humility, to face it. Might I, as a
son, be equally able to answer for myself, and to show, when the Great
Judge demanded the question of me, whether I had done my own duty, and
honoured my father and mother! O popoi! My grandfather has quoted in his (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>)
memoir a line of Homer, showing how in our troubles and griefs the
gods are always called in question. When our pride, our avarice, our
interest, our desire to domineer, are worked upon, are we not for
ever pestering Heaven to decide in their favour? In our great American
quarrel, did we not on both sides appeal to the skies as to the
justice of our causes, sing Te Deum for victory, and boldly express our
confidence that the right should prevail? Was America right because
she (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) was victorious? Then I suppose Poland was wrong because she (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) was
defeated?--How am I wandering into this digression about Poland,
America, and what not, and all the while thinking of a little woman now
no more, who appealed to Heaven and confronted it with a thousand texts
out of its own book, because her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) son wanted to make a marriage not of
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) liking? We appeal, we imprecate, we go down on our knees, we demand
blessings, we shriek out for sentence according to law; the great course
of the great world moves on; we pant, and strive, and struggle; we hate;
we rage; we weep passionate tears; we reconcile; we race and win; we
race and lose; we pass away, and other little strugglers succeed; our
days are spent; our night comes, and another morning rises, which shines
on us no more.

<p/>My letter to Madam Esmond, announcing my revolt and disobedience
-LRB-perhaps I myself was a little proud of the composition of that
document-RRB-, I showed in duplicate to Mr. Lambert, because I wished him (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>)
to understand what my relations to my mother were, and how I was
determined, whatever of threats or quarrels the future might bring,
never for my own part to consider my separation from Theo as other than
a forced one. Whenever I could see her (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) again I would. My word given
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) was in secula seculorum, or binding at least as long as my life
should endure. I implied that the girl was similarly bound to me, and
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) poor father knew indeed as much. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) might separate us; as he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) might
give her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) a dose of poison, and the gentle, obedient creature would take
it and die; but the death or separation would be his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) doing: let him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
answer them. Now he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was tender about his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) children to weakness, and could
not have the heart to submit any one of them--this one especially--to
torture. We had tried to part: we could not. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had endeavoured to
separate us: it was more than was in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) power. The bars were up, but
the young couple--the maid within and the knight without--were loving
each other all the same. The wall was built, but Pyramus and Thisbe were
whispering on either side. In the midst of all his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) grief and perplexity,
Uncle Lambert had plenty of humour, and could not but see that his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) role
was rather a sorry one. Light was beginning to show through that lime
and rough plaster of the wall: the lovers were getting their hands
through, then their heads through--indeed, it was wall's best business
to retire.

<p/>I forget what happened stage by stage and day by day; nor, for the
instruction of future ages, does it much matter. When my descendants
have love scrapes of their own, they will find their own means of
getting out of them. I believe I did not go back to Dean Street, but
that practice of driving in the open air was considered most healthful
for Miss Lambert. I got a fine horse, and rode by the side of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>)
carriage. The old woman at Tottenham Court came to know both of us quite
well, and nod and wink in the most friendly manner when we passed by.
I fancy the old goody was not unaccustomed to interest herself in young
couples, and has dispensed the hospitality of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) roadside cottage to
more than one pair.

<p/>The doctor and the country air effected a prodigious cure upon Miss
Lambert. Hetty always attended as duenna, and sometimes of his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) holiday,
Master Charley rode my horse when I got into the carriage. What a deal
of love-making Miss Hetty heard!--with what exemplary patience she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
listened to it! I do not say she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) went to hear the Methodist sermons any
more, but `tis certain that when we had a closed carriage she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) would very
kindly and considerately look out of the window. Then, what heaps of
letters there were!--what running to and fro! Gumbo's bandy legs were
for ever on the trot from my quarters to Dean Street; and, on my account
or her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) own, Mrs. Molly, the girl's maid, was for ever bringing back
answers to Bloomsbury. By the time when the autumn leaves began to turn
pale, Miss Theo's roses were in full bloom again, and my good Doctor
Heberden's cure was pronounced to be complete. What else happened during
this blessed period? Mr. Warrington completed his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) great tragedy of
Pocahontas, which was not only accepted by Mr. Garrick this time -LRB-his (<font color='blue'><b>Garrick</b></font>)
friend Dr. Johnson having spoken not unfavourably of the work-RRB-, but my
friend and cousin, Hagan, was engaged by the manager to perform the part
of the hero, Captain Smith. Hagan's engagement was not made before it
was wanted. I had helped him (<font color='blue'><b>Hagan</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Hagan</b></font>) family with means disproportioned,
perhaps, to my power, especially considering my feud with Madam Esmond,
whose answer to my angry missive of April came to me towards autumn,
and who wrote back from Virginia with war for war, controlment for
controlment. These menaces, however, frightened me little: my poor
mother's thunder could not reach me; and my conscience, or casuistry,
supplied me with other interpretations for her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) texts of Scripture, so
that her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) oracles had not the least weight with me in frightening me from
my purpose. How my new loves speeded I neither informed her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), nor any
other members of my maternal or paternal family, who, on both sides, had
been bitter against my marriage. Of what use wrangling with them? It was
better to carpere diem and its sweet loves and pleasures, and to leave
the railers to grumble, or the seniors to advise, at their ease.

<p/>Besides Madam Esmond I had, it must be owned, in the frantic rage of my
temporary separation, addressed notes of wondrous sarcasm to my Uncle
Warrington, to my Aunt Madame de Bernstein, and to my Lord or Lady
of Castlewood -LRB-I forget to which individually-RRB-, thanking them for the
trouble which they had taken in preventing the dearest happiness of my
life, and promising them a corresponding gratitude from their obliged
relative. Business brought the jovial Baronet and his (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>) family to London
somewhat earlier than usual, and Madame de Bernstein was never sorry
to get back to Clarges Street and her (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) cards. I saw them. They found me
perfectly well. They concluded the match was broken off, and I did not
choose to undeceive them. The Baroness took heart at seeing how cheerful
I was, and made many sly jokes about my philosophy, and my prudent
behaviour as a man of the world. She (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) was, as ever, bent upon finding a
rich match for me: and I fear I paid many compliments at her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) house to
a rich young soap-boiler's daughter from Mile End, whom the worthy
Baroness wished to place in my arms.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You court her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) with infinite wit and esprit, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>kinswoman</b></font>)</div>says my pleased
kinswoman, <div class="bookquote">``but she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) does not understand half you say, and the other
half, I think, frightens her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). This ton de persiflage is very well in our
society, but you must be sparing of it, my dear nephew, amongst these
roturiers.''

 (<font color='red'><b>kinswoman</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Badge married a young gentleman of royal dignity, though shattered
fortunes, from a neighbouring island; and I trust Mrs. Mackshane has
ere this pardoned my levity. There was another person besides Miss at my
aunt's house, who did not understand my persiflage much better than Miss
herself; and that was a lady who had seen James the Second's reign, and
who was alive and as worldly as ever in King George's. I loved to be
with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>): but that my little folks have access to this volume, I could
put down a hundred stories of the great old folks whom she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had known in
the great old days--of George the First and his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) ladies, of St. John and
Marlborough, of his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) reigning Majesty and the late Prince of Wales, and
the causes of the quarrel between them--but my modest muse pipes for
boys and virgins. Son Miles does not care about court stories, or if he (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>)
doth, has a fresh budget from Carlton House, quite as bad as the worst
of our old Baroness. No, my dear wife, thou hast no need to shake thy
powdered locks at me! Papa is not going to scandalise his (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>) nursery with
old-world gossip, nor bring a blush over our chaste bread-and-butter.

<p/>But this piece of scandal I cannot help. My aunt used to tell it with
infinite gusto; for, to do her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) justice, she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) hated your would-be good
people, and sniggered over the faults of the self-styled righteous with
uncommon satisfaction. In her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) later days she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) had no hypocrisy, at least;
and in so far was better than some whitewashed... Well, to the story.
My Lady Warrington, one of the tallest and the most virtuous of her (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) sex,
who had goodness for ever on her (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) lips and <div class="bookquote">``Heaven in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) eye,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Warrington</b></font>)</div>like the
woman in Mr. Addison's tedious tragedy -LRB-which has kept the stage, from
which some others, which shall be nameless, have disappeared-RRB-, had the
world in her (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) other eye, and an exceedingly shrewd desire of pushing
herself in it. What does she (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) do, when my marriage with your ladyship
yonder was supposed to be broken off, but attempt to play off on me
those arts which she (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) had tried on my poor Harry with such signal ill
success, and which failed with me likewise! It was not the Beauty--Miss
Flora was for my master---LRB-and what a master! I protest I take off my hat
at the idea of such an illustrious connexion!-RRB---it was Dora, the Muse,
was set upon me to languish at me and to pity me, and to read even my
godless tragedy, and applaud me and console me. Meanwhile, how was the
Beauty occupied? Will it be believed that my severe aunt gave a great
entertainment to my Lady Yarmouth, presented her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) boy to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>), and placed
poor little Miles under her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) ladyship's august protection? That, so
far, is certain; but can it be that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) sent her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) daughter to stay at my
lady's house, which our gracious lord and master daily visited, and with
the views which old Aunt Bernstein attributed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>)? <div class="bookquote">``But for that
fit of apoplexy, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bernstein/Madame de Bernstein/Madame Bernstein</b></font>)</div>Bernstein said, <div class="bookquote">``that aunt of yours intended

edition. See the story of the supper at N. House, to show what great
noblemen would do for a king's mistress, and the pleasant account of

neighbour and kinswoman, my Lady Claypole, is dead and buried. Grow
white, ye daisies, upon Flora's tomb! I can see my pretty Miles, in a

lady whom the King delighted to honour, and the good-natured old Jezebel
laying her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) hand upon the boy's curly pate. I am accused of being but a
lukewarm royalist; but sure I can contrast those times with ours, and
acknowledge the difference between the late sovereign and the present,
who, born a Briton, has given to every family in the empire an example
of decorum and virtuous life. -LSB-The Warrington MS. is dated 1793.-ED.-RSB-

<p/>Thus my life sped in the pleasantest of all occupation; and, being so
happy myself, I could afford to be reconciled to those who, after all,
had done me no injury, but rather added to the zest of my happiness by
the brief obstacle which they had placed in my way. No specific plans
were formed, but Theo and I knew that a day would come when we need
say Farewell no more. Should the day befall a year hence--ten years
hence--we were ready to wait. Day after day we discussed our little
plans, with Hetty for our confidante. On our drives we spied out pretty
cottages that we thought might suit young people of small means; we
devised all sorts of delightful schemes and childish economies. We were
Strephon and Chloe to be sure. A cot and a brown loaf should content us!
Gumbo and Molly should wait upon us -LRB-as indeed they have done from that
day until this-RRB-. At twenty, who is afraid of being poor? Our trials
would only confirm our attachment. The <div class="bookquote">``sweet sorrow''  (<font color='red'><b>gentlemen</b></font>)</div>of every day's
parting but made the morrow's meeting more delightful; and when we
separated we ran home and wrote each other those precious letters which
we and other young gentlemen and ladies write under such circumstances;
but though my wife has them all in a great tin sugar-box in the closet
in her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) bedroom, and, I own, I myself have looked at them once, and even
thought some of them pretty,--I hereby desire my heirs and executors
to burn them all, unread, at our demise; specially desiring my son the
Captain -LRB-to whom I know the perusal of MSS. is not pleasant-RRB- to perform
this duty. Those secrets whispered to the penny-post, or delivered
between Molly and Gumbo, were intended for us alone, and no ears of our
descendants shall overhear them.

<p/>We heard in successive brief letters how our dear Harry continued with
the army, as Mr. General Amherst's aide-de-camp, after the death of his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>)
own glorious general. By the middle of October there came news of the
Capitulation of Montreal and the whole of Canada, and a brief postscript
in which Hal said he (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>) would ask for leave now, and must go and see the
old lady at home, who wrote as sulky as a bare, Captain Warrington
remarked. I could guess why, though the claws could not reach me. I had
written pretty fully to my brother how affairs were standing with me in
England.

<p/>Then, on the 25th October, comes the news that his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) Majesty has fallen
down dead at Kensington, and that George III. reigned over us. I fear we
grieved but little. What do those care for the Atridae whose hearts are
strung only to erota mounon? A modest, handsome, brave new Prince, we
gladly accept the common report that he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) is endowed with every virtue;
and we cry huzzay with the loyal crowd that hails his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) accession:
it could make little difference to us, as we thought, simple young
sweethearts, whispering our little love-stories in our corner.

<p/>But who can say how great events affect him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>)? Did not our little Charley,
at the Chartreux, wish impiously for a new king immediately, because on
his (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) gracious Majesty's accession Doctor Crusius gave his (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) boys a holiday?
He (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) and I, and Hetty, and Theo -LRB-Miss Theo was strong enough to walk
many a delightful mile now-RRB-, heard the Heralds proclaim his (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) new Majesty
before Savile House in Leicester Fields, and a pickpocket got the watch
and chain of a gentleman hard by us, and was caught and carried to
Bridewell, all on account of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) Majesty's accession. Had the king not
died, the gentleman would not have been in the crowd; the chain would
not have been seized; the thief would not have been caught and soundly
whipped: in this way many of us, more or less remotely, were implicated
in the great change which ensued, and even we humble folks were affected
by it presently.

<p/>As thus. My Lord Wrotham was a great friend of the august family of
Savile House, who knew and esteemed his (<font color='blue'><b>Wrotham</b></font>) many virtues. Now, of all
living men, my Lord Wrotham knew and loved best his (<font color='blue'><b>Wrotham</b></font>) neighbour and old
fellow-soldier, Martin Lambert, declaring that the world contained few
better gentlemen. And my Lord Bute, being all potent, at first, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>)
Majesty, and a nobleman, as I believe, very eager at the commencement of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) brief and luckless tenure of power, to patronise merit wherever he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>)
could find it, was strongly prejudiced in Mr. Lambert's favour by the
latter's old and constant friend.

<p/>My -LRB-and Harry's-RRB- old friend Parson Sampson, who had been in and out
of gaol I don't know how many times of late years, and retained an
ever-enduring hatred for the Esmonds of Castlewood, and as lasting a
regard for me and my brother, was occupying poor Hal's vacant bed at
my lodgings at this time -LRB-being, in truth, hunted out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>) own by
the bailiffs-RRB-. I liked to have Sampson near me, for a more amusing
Jack-friar never walked in cassock; and, besides, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) entered into all my
rhapsodies about Miss Theo; was never tired -LRB-so he (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) vowed-RRB- of hearing
me talk of her (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>); admired Pocahontas and Carpezan with, I do believe, an
honest enthusiasm; and could repeat whole passages of those tragedies
with an emphasis and effect that Barry or cousin Hagan himself could not
surpass. Sampson was the go-between between Lady Maria and such of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>)
relations as had not disowned her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>); and, always in debt himself, was
never more happy than in drinking a pot, or mingling his (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) tears with his (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>)
friends in similar poverty. His (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) acquaintance with pawnbrokers' shops was
prodigious. He (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) could procure more money, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) boasted, on an article than
any gentleman of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) cloth. He (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) never paid his (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) own debts, to be sure,
but he (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) was ready to forgive his (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) debtors. Poor as he (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) was, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) always found
means to love and help his (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) needy little sister, and a more prodigal,
kindly, amiable rogue never probably grinned behind bars. They say that
I love to have parasites about me. I own to have had a great liking for
Sampson, and to have esteemed him (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) much better than probably much better
men.

<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) heard how my Lord Bute was admitted into the cabinet, Sampson
vowed and declared that his (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) lordship--a great lover of the drama, who
had been to see Carpezan, who had admired it, and who would act the part
of the king very finely in it--he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) vowed, by George! that my lord must
give me a place worthy of my birth and merits. He (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) insisted upon it that
I should attend his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) lordship's levee. I wouldn't? The Esmonds were all
as proud as Lucifer; and, to be sure, my birth was as good as that of
any man in Europe. Demmy! Where was my lord himself when the Esmonds
were lords of great counties, warriors, and Crusaders? Where were they?
Beggarly Scotchmen, without a rag to their backs--by George! tearing
raw fish in their islands. But now the times were changed. The Scotchmen
were in luck. Mum's the word! <div class="bookquote">``I don't envy him (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Sampson/Mr. Sampson</b></font>)</div>says Sampson, <div class="bookquote">``but he (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>)
shall provide for you and my dearest, noblest, heroic captain! He (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) SHALL,
by George!''  (<font color='red'><b>Sampson/Mr. Sampson</b></font>)</div>would my worthy parson roar out. And when, in the month
after his (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) accession, his (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) Majesty ordered the play of Richard III. at
Drury Lane, my chaplain cursed, vowed, swore, but he (<font color='blue'><b>chaplain</b></font>) would have him (<font color='blue'><b>chaplain</b></font>) to
Covent Garden to see Carpezan too. And now, one morning, he (<font color='blue'><b>chaplain</b></font>) bursts into
my apartment, where I happened to lie rather late, waving the newspaper
in his (<font color='blue'><b>chaplain</b></font>) hand, and singing <div class="bookquote">``Huzza!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>with all his (<font color='blue'><b>chaplain</b></font>) might.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is it, Sampson?''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>says I. <div class="bookquote">``Has my brother got his (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) promotion?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, in truth: but some one else has. Huzzay! huzzay! His (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) Majesty
has appointed Major-General Martin Lambert to be Governor and
Commander-in-Chief of the Island of Jamaica.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I started up. Here was news, indeed! Mr. Lambert would go to his (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>)
government: and who would go with him (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>)? I had been supping with some
genteel young fellows at the Cocoa-Tree. The rascal Gumbo had a note for
me from my dear mistress on the night previous, conveying the same news
to me, and had delayed to deliver it. Theo begged me to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) at the
old place at midday the next day without fail. -LSB-In the Warrington
MS. there is not a word to say what the <div class="bookquote">``old place''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>was. Perhaps some
obliging reader of Notes and Queries will be able to inform me, and who
Mrs. Goodison was.-ED.-RSB-

<p/>There was no little trepidation in our little council when we reached
our place of meeting. Papa had announced his (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>) acceptance of the
appointment, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>) speedy departure. He (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>) would have a frigate given
him (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>), and take his (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>) family with him (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>). Merciful powers! and were we to be
parted? My Theo's old deathly paleness returned to her (<font color='blue'><b>Goodison</b></font>). Aunt Lambert
thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) would have swooned; one of Mrs. Goodison's girls had a
bottle of salts, and ran up with it from the workroom. <div class="bookquote">``Going away?
Going away in a frigate, Aunt Lambert? Going to tear her (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) away from me?
Great God! Aunt Lambert, I shall die!''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) was better when mamma came
up from the workroom with the young lady's bottle of salts. You see the
women used to meet me: knowing dear Theo's delicate state, how could
they refrain from compassionating her (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>)! But the General was so busy
with his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) levees and his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) waiting on Ministers, and his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) outfit, and the
settlement of his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) affairs at home, that they never happened to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>)
about our little walks and meetings; and even when orders for the outfit
of the ladies were given, Mrs. Goodison, who had known and worked
for Miss Molly Benson as a schoolgirl -LRB-she (<font color='blue'><b>schoolgirl</b></font>) remembered Miss Esmond of
Virginia perfectly, the worthy lady told me, and a dress she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) made for
the young lady to be presented at her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) Majesty's Ball-RRB---<div class="bookquote">``even when the
outfit was ordered for the three ladies,''  (<font color='red'><b>Majesty</b></font>)</div>says Mrs. Goodison, demurely,
<div class="bookquote">``why, I thought I could do no harm in completing the order.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Goodison</b></font>)</div><p/>Now I need not say in what perturbation of mind Mr. Warrington went home
in the evening to his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) lodgings, after the discussion with the ladies of
the above news. No, or at least a very few, more walks; no more rides to
dear, dear Hampstead or beloved Islington; no more fetching and carrying
of letters for Gumbo and Molly! The former blubbered so, that Mr.
Warrington was quite touched by his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) fidelity, and gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) a crown-piece
to go to supper with the poor girl, who turned out to be his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) sweetheart.
What, you too unhappy, Gumbo, and torn from the maid you love? I was
ready to mingle with him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) tear for tear.

<p/>What a solemn conference I had with Sampson that evening! He (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) knew my
affairs, my expectations, my mother's anger. Psha! that was far off, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) knew some excellent liberal people -LRB-of the order of Melchizedek-RRB-
who would discount the other. The General would not give his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) consent?
Sampson shrugged his (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) broad shoulders and swore a great roaring oath. My
mother would not relent? What then? A man was a man, and to make his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
own way in the world? he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) supposed. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is only a churl who won't play for
such a stake as that, and lose or win, by George! shouts the chaplain,
over a bottle of Burgundy at the Bedford Head, where he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) dined. I need
not put down our conversation. We were two of us, and I think there was
only one mind between us. Our talk was of a Saturday night...

<p/>I did not tell Theo, nor any relative of hers, what was being done.
But when the dear child faltered and talked, trembling, of the
coming departure, I bade her (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>) bear up, and vowed all would be well, so
confidently, that she (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>), who ever has taken her (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>) alarms and joys from my
face -LRB-I wish, my dear, it were sometimes not so gloomy-RRB-, could not but
feel confidence; and placed -LRB-with many fond words that need not here be
repeated-RRB- her (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>) entire trust in me--murmuring those sweet words of Ruth
that must have comforted myriads of tender hearts in my dearest maiden's
plight; that whither I would go she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruth</b></font>) would go, and that my people should
be hers. At last, one day, the General's preparations being made, the
trunks encumbering the passages of the dear old Dean Street lodging,
which I shall love as long as I shall remember at all--one day, almost
the last of his (<font color='blue'><b>Dean</b></font>) stay, when the good man -LRB-his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) Excellency we called him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
now-RRB- came home to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) dinner--a comfortless meal enough it was in the
present condition of the family--he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) looked round the table at the place
where I had used to sit in happy old days, and sighed out: <div class="bookquote">``I wish,
Molly, George was here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you, Martin?''  (<font color='red'><b>Aunt Lambert</b></font>)</div>says Aunt Lambert, flinging into his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) arms.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I do; but I don't wish you to choke me, Molly,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) says. <div class="bookquote">``I love
him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) dearly. I may go away and never see him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) again, and take his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) foolish

children? I can't prevent that, you know; and until he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) changes his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) mind,
I suppose Miss Theo won't obey papa's orders, and get him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>)

when I entered he (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) held me to his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) heart, and kissed me.

<p/>I confess at this I was so overcome that I fell down on my knees before
the dear, good man, and sobbed on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own.

<p/>CHAPTER LXXIX. Containing both Comedy and Tragedy


<p/>We, who had been active in the guilty scene of the morning, felt trebly
guilty when we saw the effect which our conduct had produced upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>),
who, of all others, we loved and respected. The shock to the good man
was strange, and pitiful to us to witness who had administered it. The
child of his (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) heart had deceived and disobeyed him (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>)--I declare I think, my
dear, now, we would not or could not do it over again; his (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) whole family
had entered into a league against him (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>). Dear, kind friend and father!
We know thou hast pardoned our wrong--in the Heaven where thou dwellest
amongst purified spirits who learned on earth how to love and pardon! To
love and forgive were easy duties with that man. Beneficence was natural
to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and a sweet, smiling humility; and to wound either was to be
savage and brutal, as to torture a child, or strike blows at a nursing
woman. The deed done, all we guilty ones grovelled in the earth, before
the man we had injured. I pass over the scenes of forgiveness, of
reconciliation, of common worship together, of final separation when the
good man departed to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) government, and the ship sailed away before us,
leaving me and Theo on the shore. We stood there hand in hand, horribly
abashed, silent, and guilty. My wife did not come to me till her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) father
went: in the interval between the ceremony of our marriage and his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
departure, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had remained at home, occupying her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) old place by her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
father, and bed by her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) sister's side: he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) as kind as ever, but the women
almost speechless among themselves; Aunt Lambert, for once, unkind
and fretful in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) temper; and little Hetty feverish and strange, and
saying, <div class="bookquote">``I wish we were gone. I wish we were gone.''  (<font color='red'><b>Hetty/Miss Hetty/Lambert</b></font>)</div>Though admitted to
the house, and forgiven, I slunk away during those last days, and only
saw my wife for a minute or two in the street, or with her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) family. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
was not mine till they were gone. We went to Winchester and Hampton
for what may be called our wedding. It was but a dismal business. For a
while we felt utterly lonely: and of our dear father as if we had buried
him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), or drove him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) to the grave by our undutifulness.

<p/>I made Sampson announce our marriage in the papers. -LRB-My wife used to
hang down her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) head before the poor fellow afterwards.-RRB- I took Mrs.
Warrington back to my old lodgings in Bloomsbury, where there was plenty
of room for us, and our modest married life began. I wrote home a letter
to my mother in Virginia, informing her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) of no particulars, but only
that Mr. Lambert being about to depart for his (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) government, I considered
myself bound in honour to fulfil my promise towards his (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) dearest
daughter; and stated that I intended to carry out my intention of
completing my studies for the Bar, and qualifying myself for employment
at home, or in our own or any other colony. My good Mrs. Mountain
answered this letter, by desire of Madam Esmond, she (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) said, who thought
that for the sake of peace my communications had best be conducted
that way. I found my relatives in a fury which was perfectly amusing
to witness. The butler's face, as he (<font color='blue'><b>butler</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Not at home,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>at my uncle's
house in Hill Street, was a blank tragedy that might have been studied
by Garrick when he (<font color='blue'><b>Garrick</b></font>) sees Banque. My poor little wife was on my arm, and
we were tripping away, laughing at the fellow's accueil, when we came
upon my lady in a street stoppage in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) chair. I took off my hat and
made her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) the lowest possible bow. I affectionately asked after my dear
cousins. <div class="bookquote">``I--I wonder you dare look me in the face!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Warrington</b></font>)</div>Lady Warrington
gasped out. <div class="bookquote">``Nay, don't deprive me of that precious privilege!''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>says I.
<div class="bookquote">``Move on, Peter,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) screams to her (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) chairman. <div class="bookquote">``Your ladyship would not
impale your own husband's flesh and blood!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>says I. She (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) rattles up
the glass of her (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) chair in a fury. I kiss my hand, take off my hat, and
perform another of my very finest bows.

<p/>Walking shortly afterwards in Hyde Park with my dearest companion, I
met my little cousin exercising on horseback with a groom behind him (<font color='blue'><b>groom</b></font>). As
soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>groom</b></font>) sees us, he (<font color='blue'><b>groom</b></font>) gallops up to us, the groom powdering afterwards
and bawling out, <div class="bookquote">``Stop, Master Miles, stop!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the groom</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not to speak to my cousin,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miles/Miles Warrington</b></font>)</div>says Miles, <div class="bookquote">``but telling you to send
my love to Harry is not speaking to you, is it? Is that my new
cousin? I'm not told not to speak to her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>). I'm Miles, cousin, Sir Miles
Warrington Baronet's son, and you are very pretty!''  (<font color='red'><b>Miles/Miles Warrington</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Now, duee now,
Master Miles,''  (<font color='red'><b>the groom</b></font>)</div>says the groom, touching his (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) hat to us; and the boy
trots away laughing and looking at us over his (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) shoulder. <div class="bookquote">``You see how
my relations have determined to treat me,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I say to my partner. <div class="bookquote">``As if
I married you for your relations!''  (<font color='red'><b>Theo/Lady Theo</b></font>)</div>says Theo, her (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) eyes beaming joy
and love into mine. Ah, how happy we were! how brisk and pleasant the
winter! How snug the kettle by the fire -LRB-where the abashed Sampson
sometimes came and made the punch-RRB-; how delightful the night at the
theatre, for which our friends brought us tickets of admission, and
where we daily expected our new play of Pocahontas would rival the
successes of all former tragedies.

<p/>The fickle old aunt of Clarges Street, who received me, on my first
coming to London with my wife, with a burst of scorn, mollified
presently, and as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) came to know Theo -LRB-who she (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) had pronounced
to be an insignificant little country-faced chit-RRB-, fell utterly in love
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>), and would have her (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) to tea and supper every day when there was
no other company. <div class="bookquote">``As for company, my dears,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) would say, <div class="bookquote">``I don't
ask you. You are no longer du monde. Your marriage has put that entirely
out of the question.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>So she (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) would have had us come to amuse her (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>), and go
in and out by the back-stairs. My wife was fine lady enough to feel only
amused at this reception; and, I must do the Baroness's domestics the
justice to say that, had we been duke and duchess, we could not have
been received with more respect. Madame de Bernstein was very much
tickled and amused with my story of Lady Warrington and the chair. I
acted it for her (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>), and gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) anecdotes of the pious Baronet's lady and
her (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) daughters, which pleased the mischievous, lively old woman.

<p/>The Dowager Countess of Castlewood, now established in her (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) house at
Kensington, gave us that kind of welcome which genteel ladies extend to
their poorer relatives. We went once or twice to her (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) ladyship's drums at
Kensington; but, losing more money at cards, and spending more money
in coach-hire than I liked to afford, we speedily gave up those
entertainments, and, I dare say, were no more missed or regretted than
other people in the fashionable world, who are carried by death, debt,
or other accident out of the polite sphere. My Theo did not in the
least regret this exclusion. She (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) had made her (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) appearance at one of these
drums, attired in some little ornaments which her (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) mother left behind
her (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>), and by which the good lady set some store; but I thought her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) own
white neck was a great deal prettier than these poor twinkling stones;
and there were dowagers, whose wrinkled old bones blazed with rubies
and diamonds, which, I am sure, they would gladly have exchanged for her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
modest parure of beauty and freshness. Not a soul spoke to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)--except,
to be sure, Beau Lothair, a friend of Mr. Will's, who prowled about
Bloomsbury afterwards, and even sent my wife a billet. I met him (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) in
Covent Garden shortly after, and promised to break his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) ugly face if
ever I saw it in the neighbourhood of my lodgings, and Madam Theo was
molested no further.

<p/>The only one of our relatives who came to see us -LRB-Madame de Bernstein
never came; she (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) sent her (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) coach for us sometimes, or made inquiries
regarding us by her (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) woman or her (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) major-domo-RRB- was our poor Maria, who,
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) husband, Mr. Hagan, often took a share of our homely dinner.
Then we had friend Spencer from the Temple, who admired our Arcadian
felicity, and gently asked our sympathy for his (<font color='blue'><b>Spencer</b></font>) less fortunate loves;
and twice or thrice the famous Doctor Johnson came in for a dish of
Theo's tea. A dish? a pailful! <div class="bookquote">``And a pail the best thing to feed him (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>),
sar!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Gumbo, indignantly: for the Doctor's appearance was not
pleasant, nor his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) linen particularly white. He (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) snorted, he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) grew red,
and sputtered in feeding; he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) flung his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) meat about, and bawled out in
contradicting people: and annoyed my Theo, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) professed to admire
greatly, by saying, every time he (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``Madam, you do not love me;
I see by your manner you do not love me; though I admire you, and come
here for your sake. Here is my friend Mr. Reynolds that shall paint
you: he (<font color='blue'><b>Reynolds</b></font>) has no ceruse in his (<font color='blue'><b>Reynolds</b></font>) paint-box that is as brilliant as
your complexion.''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>And so Mr. Reynolds, a most perfect and agreeable
gentleman, would have painted my wife; but I knew what his (<font color='blue'><b>Reynolds</b></font>) price was,
and did not choose to incur that expense. I wish I had now, for the
sake of the children, that they might see what yonder face was like some
five-and-thirty years ago. To me, madam, `tis the same now as ever; and
your ladyship is always young!

<p/>What annoyed Mrs. Warrington with Dr. Johnson more than his (<font color='blue'><b>Johnson</b></font>)
contradictions, his (<font color='blue'><b>Johnson</b></font>) sputterings, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Johnson</b></font>) dirty nails, was, I think,
an unfavourable opinion which he (<font color='blue'><b>Johnson</b></font>) formed of my new tragedy. Hagan once
proposed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hagan</b></font>) should read some scenes from it after tea.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, sir, conversation is better,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Doctor</b></font>)</div>says the Doctor. <div class="bookquote">``I can read for
myself, or hear you at the theatre. I had rather hear Mrs. Warrington's
artless prattle than your declamation of Mr. Warrington's decasyllables.
Tell us about your household affairs, madam, and whether his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) Excellency
your father is well, and whether you made the pudden and the butter
sauce. The butter sauce was delicious!''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>-LRB-He (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) loved it so well that he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) had
kept a large quantity in the bosom of a very dingy shirt.-RRB- <div class="bookquote">``You made it
as though you loved me. You helped me as though you loved me, though you
don't.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Faith, sir, you are taking some of the present away with you in your
waistcoat,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hagan/Mr. Hagan</b></font>)</div>says Hagan, with much spirit.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sir, you are rude!''  (<font color='red'><b>the Doctor</b></font>)</div>bawls the Doctor. <div class="bookquote">``You are unacquainted with the
first principles of politeness, which is courtesy before ladies. Having
received an university education, I am surprised that you have not
learned the rudiments of politeness. I respect Mrs. Warrington. I should
never think of making personal remarks about her (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) guests before her (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hagan/Mr. Hagan</b></font>)</div>says Hagan, fiercely, <div class="bookquote">``why did you speak of my theatre?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hagan/Mr. Hagan</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sir, you are saucy!''  (<font color='red'><b>the Doctor</b></font>)</div>roars the Doctor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``De te fabula,''  (<font color='red'><b>the actor</b></font>)</div>says the actor. <div class="bookquote">``I think it is your waistcoat that is
saucy. Madam, shall I make some punch in the way we make it in Ireland?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Doctor</b></font>)</div><p/>The Doctor, puffing, and purple in the face, was wiping the dingy shirt
with a still more dubious pocket-handkerchief, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) then applied to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) forehead. After this exercise, he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) blew a hyperborean whistle, as
if to blow his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) wrath away. <div class="bookquote">``It is de me, sir--though, as a young man,
perhaps you need not have told me so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I drop my point, sir! If you have been wrong, I am sure I am bound to
ask your pardon for setting you so!''  (<font color='red'><b>Hagan/Mr. Hagan</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Hagan, with a fine bow.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Doesn't he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) look like a god?''  (<font color='red'><b>Maria/Lady Maria/Lady Maria Esmond</b></font>)</div>says Maria, clutching my wife's hand: and
indeed Mr. Hagan did look like a handsome young gentleman. His (<font color='blue'><b>Hagan</b></font>) colour
had risen; he (<font color='blue'><b>Hagan</b></font>) had put his (<font color='blue'><b>Hagan</b></font>) hand to his (<font color='blue'><b>Hagan</b></font>) breast with a noble air: Chamont
or Castalio could not present himself better.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let me make you some lemonade, sir; my papa has sent us a box of fresh
limes. May we send you some to the Temple?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Madam, if they stay in your house, they will lose their quality and
turn sweet,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Doctor</b></font>)</div>says the Doctor. <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Hagan, you are a young sauce-box,
that's what you are! Ho! ho! It is I have been wrong.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, my lord, my Polidore!''  (<font color='red'><b>Maria/Lady Maria/Lady Maria Esmond</b></font>)</div>bleats Lady Maria, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) was alone in my
wife's drawing-room:

<p/>```Oh, I could hear thee talk for ever thus,
Eternally admiring,--fix and gaze
On those dear eyes, for every glance they send
Darts through my soul, and fills my heart with rapture!'

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thou knowest not, my Theo, what a pearl and paragon of a man my
Castalio is; my Chamont, my--oh, dear me, child, what a pity it is that
in your husband's tragedy he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) should have to take the horrid name of
Captain Smith!''

 (<font color='red'><b>prospects</b></font>)</div><p/>Upon this tragedy not only my literary hopes, but much of my financial
prospects were founded. My brother's debts discharged, my mother's
drafts from home duly honoured, my own expenses paid, which, though
moderate, were not inconsiderable,--pretty nearly the whole of my
patrimony had been spent, and this auspicious moment I must choose
for my marriage! I could raise money on my inheritance: that was not
impossible, though certainly costly. My mother could not leave her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
eldest son without a maintenance, whatever our quarrels might be. I had
health, strength, good wits, some friends, and reputation--above all, my
famous tragedy, which the manager had promised to perform, and upon the
proceeds of this I counted for my present support. What becomes of the
arithmetic of youth? How do we then calculate that a hundred pounds is
a maintenance, and a thousand a fortune? How did I dare play against
Fortune with such odds? I succeeded, I remember, in convincing my dear
General, and he (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) left home convinced that his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) son-in-law had for the
present necessity at least a score of hundred pounds at his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) command. He (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>)
and his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) dear Molly had begun life with less, and the ravens had somehow
always fed them. As for the women, the question of poverty was one of
pleasure to those sentimental souls, and Aunt Lambert, for her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) part,
declared it would be wicked and irreligious to doubt of a provision
being made for her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) children. Was the righteous ever forsaken? Did the
just man ever have to beg his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) bread? She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) knew better than that! <div class="bookquote">``No, no,
my dears! I am not going to be afraid on that account, I warrant you!
Look at me and my General!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Theo/Lady Theo</b></font>)</div><p/>Theo believed all I said and wished to believe myself. So we actually
began life upon a capital of Five Acts, and about three hundred pounds
of ready money in hand!

<p/>Well, the time of the appearance of the famous tragedy drew near, and my
friends canvassed the town to get a body of supporters for the opening
night. I am ill at asking favours from the great; but when my Lord
Wrotham came to London, I went, with Theo in my hand, to wait on his (<font color='blue'><b>Wrotham</b></font>)
lordship, who received us kindly, out of regard for his (<font color='blue'><b>Wrotham</b></font>) old friend,
her (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) father--though he (<font color='blue'><b>Wrotham</b></font>) good-naturedly shook a finger at me -LRB-at which my
little wife hung down her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) head-RRB-, for having stole a march on the good
General. However, he (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) would do his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) best for her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) father's daughter; hoped
for a success; said he (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) had heard great things of the piece; and engaged
a number of places for himself and his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) friends. But this patron secured,
I had no other. <div class="bookquote">``Mon cher, at my age,''  (<font color='red'><b>Baroness/Baroness Bernstein/Bernstein</b></font>)</div>says the Baroness, <div class="bookquote">``I should
bore myself to death at a tragedy: but I will do my best; and I will
certainly send my people to the boxes. Yes! Case in his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) best black looks
like a nobleman; and Brett in one of my gowns has a faux air de moi
which is quite distinguished. Put down my name for two in the front
boxes. Good-bye, my dear. Bonne chance!''  (<font color='red'><b>Baroness/Baroness Bernstein/Bernstein</b></font>)</div>The Dowager Countess presented
compliments -LRB-on the back of the nine of clubs-RRB-, had a card-party that
night, and was quite sorry she (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) and Fanny could not go to my tragedy. As
for my uncle and Lady Warrington, they were out of the question. After
the affair of the sedan-chair I might as well have asked Queen
Elizabeth to go to Drury Lane. These were all my friends--that host of
aristocratic connexions about whom poor Sampson had bragged; and on
the strength of whom, the manager, as he (<font color='blue'><b>manager</b></font>) said, had given Mr. Hagan his (<font color='blue'><b>Hagan</b></font>)
engagement! <div class="bookquote">``Where was my Lord Bute? Had I not promised his (<font color='blue'><b>Bute</b></font>) lordship
should come?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Hagan</b></font>) asks, snappishly, taking snuff -LRB-how different from
the brisk, and engaging, and obsequious little manager of six months
ago!-RRB---<div class="bookquote">``I promised Lord Bute should come?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Garrick/Garrick</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Garrick, <div class="bookquote">``and her (<font color='blue'><b>Brett</b></font>) Royal Highness the Princess of Wales,
and his (<font color='blue'><b>Highness</b></font>) Majesty too.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Garrick/Garrick</b></font>)</div><p/>Poor Sampson owned that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>), buoyed up by vain hopes, had promised the
appearance of these august personages.

<p/>The next day, at rehearsal, matters were worse still, and the manager in
a fury.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Great heavens, sir!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>says he (<font color='blue'><b>manager</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``into what a pretty guet-a-pens have you
led me! Look at that letter, sir!--read that letter!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>manager</b></font>) hands me
one:


<p/><div class="bookquote">``MY DEAR SIR''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>-LRB-said the letter-RRB---<div class="bookquote">``I have seen his (<font color='blue'><b>Highness</b></font>) lordship, and conveyed
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Highness</b></font>) Mr. Warrington's request that he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) would honour the tragedy of
Pocahontas by his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) presence. His (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) lordship is a patron of the drama, and
a magnificent friend of all the liberal arts; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) desires me to
say that he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) cannot think of attending himself, much less of asking his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>)
Gracious Master to witness the performance of a play, a principal part
in which is given to an actor who has made a clandestine marriage with
a daughter of one of his (<font color='blue'><b>actor</b></font>) Majesty's nobility.--Your well-wisher, SAUNDERS
MCDUFF.''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. D. Garrick, at the Theatre Royal in Drury Lane.''


 (<font color='red'><b>Theo/Lady Theo</b></font>)</div><p/>My poor Theo had a nice dinner waiting for me after the rehearsal. I
pleaded fatigue as the reason for looking so pale: I did not dare to
convey to her (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) this dreadful news.




<p/>CHAPTER LXXX. Pocahontas


<p/>The English public not being so well acquainted with the history of
Pocahontas as we of Virginia, who still love the memory of that simple
and kindly creature, Mr. Warrington, at the suggestion of his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) friends,
made a little ballad about this Indian princess, which was printed in
the magazines a few days before the appearance of the tragedy. This
proceeding Sampson and I considered to be very artful and ingenious. <div class="bookquote">``It
is like ground-bait, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>the parson</b></font>)</div>says the enthusiastic parson, <div class="bookquote">``and you will
see the fish rise in multitudes, on the great day!''  (<font color='red'><b>the parson</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) and Spencer
declared that the poem was discussed and admired at several
coffee-houses in their hearing, and that it had been attributed to Mr.
Mason, Mr. Cowper of the Temple, and even to the famous Mr. Gray.
I believe poor Sam had himself set abroad these reports; and, if
Shakspeare had been named as the author of the tragedy, would have
declared Pocahontas to be one of the poet's best performances. I made
acquaintance with brave Captain Smith, as a boy in my grandfather's
library at home, where I remember how I would sit at the good old man's
knees, with my favourite volume on my own, spelling out the exploits
of our Virginian hero. I loved to read of Smith's travels, sufferings,
captivities, escapes, not only in America but Europe. I become a child
again almost as I take from the shelf before me in England the familiar
volume, and all sorts of recollections of my early home come crowding
over my mind. The old grandfather would make pictures for me of Smith
doing battle with the Turks on the Danube, or led out by our Indian
savages to death. Ah, what a terrific fight was that in which he (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) was
engaged with the three Turkish champions, and how I used to delight over
the story of his (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) combat with Bonny Molgro, the last and most dreadful
of the three! What a name Bonny Molgro was, and with what a prodigious
turban, scimitar, and whiskers we represented him (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>)! Having slain and
taken off the heads of his (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) first two enemies, Smith and Bonny Molgro
met, falling to -LRB-says my favourite old book-RRB- <div class="bookquote">``with their battle-axes,
whose piercing bills made sometimes the one, sometimes the other,
to have scarce sense to keep their saddles: especially the Christian
received such a wound that he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) lost his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) battle-axe, whereat the supposed
conquering Turke had a great shout from the rampires. Yet, by the
readinesse of his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) horse, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) great judgment and dexteritie, he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>)
not only avoided the Turke's blows, but, having drawn his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) falchion, so
pierced the Turke under the cutlets, through back and body, that though
hee alighted from his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) horse, he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) stood not long ere hee lost his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) head as
the rest had done. In reward for which deed, Duke Segismundus gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>)
3 Turke's head in a shield for armes and 300 Duckats yeerely for a
pension.''  (<font color='red'><b>Bonny Molgro</b></font>)</div>Disdaining time and place -LRB-with that daring which is the
privilege of poets-RRB- in my tragedy, Smith is made to perform
similar exploits on the banks of our Potomac and James's river. Our
<div class="bookquote">``ground-bait''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>verses, ran thus:--

<p/>``POCAHONTAS

<p/>``Wearied arm and broken sword
Wage in vain the desperate fight
Round him (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) press the countless horde,
He (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) is but a single knight.
Hark! a cry of triumph shrill
Through the wilderness resounds,
As, with twenty bleeding wounds,
Sinks the warrior, fighting still.

<p/>``Now they heap the fatal pyre,
And the torch of death they light
Ah! `tis hard to die of fire!
Who will shield the captive knight?
Round the stake with fiendish cry
Wheel and dance the savage crowd,
Cold the victim's mien and proud,
And his (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>) breast is bared to die.

<p/>``Who will shield the fearless heart?
Who avert the murderous blade?
From the throng, with sudden start,
See, there springs an Indian maid.
Quick she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) stands before the knight,
`Loose the chain, unbind the ring,
I am daughter of the king,
And I claim the Indian right!'

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dauntlessly aside she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) flings
Lifted axe and thirsty knife;
Fondly to his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) heart she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) clings,
And her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) bosom guards his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) life!
In the woods of Powhattan,
Still `tis told, by Indian fires,
How a daughter of their sires
Saved the captive Englishman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I need not describe at length the plot of my tragedy, as my children can
take it down from the shelves any day and peruse it for themselves. Nor
shall I, let me add, be in a hurry to offer to read it again to my young
folks, since Captain Miles and the parson both chose to fall asleep last
Christmas, when, at mamma's request, I read aloud a couple of acts.
But any person having a moderate acquaintance with plays and novels
can soon, out of the above sketch, fill out a picture to his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) liking.
An Indian king; a loving princess, and her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) attendant, in love with the
British captain's servant; a traitor in the English fort; a brave Indian
warrior, himself entertaining an unhappy passion for Pocahontas; a
medicine-man and priest of the Indians -LRB-very well played by Palmer-RRB-,
capable of every treason, stratagem, and crime, and bent upon the
torture and death of the English prisoner;--these, with the accidents
of the wilderness, the war-dances and cries -LRB-which Gumbo had learned to
mimic very accurately from the red people at home-RRB-, and the arrival
of the English fleet, with allusions to the late glorious victories in
Canada, and the determination of Britons ever to rule and conquer in
America, some of us not unnaturally thought might contribute to the
success of our tragedy.

<p/>But I have mentioned the ill omens which preceded the day: the
difficulties which a peevish, and jealous, and timid management threw in
the way of the piece, and the violent prejudice which was felt against
it in certain high quarters. What wonder then, I ask, that Pocahontas
should have turned out not to be a victory? I laugh to scorn the
malignity of the critics who found fault with the performance. Pretty
critics, forsooth, who said that Carpezan was a masterpiece, whilst
a far superior and more elaborate work received only their sneers! I
insist on it that Hagan acted his (<font color='blue'><b>Hagan</b></font>) part so admirably that a certain actor
and manager of the theatre might well be jealous of him (<font color='blue'><b>Hagan</b></font>); and that, but
for the cabal made outside, the piece would have succeeded. The order
had been given that the play should not succeed; so at least Sampson
declared to me. <div class="bookquote">``The house swarmed with Macs, by George, and they should
have the galleries washed with brimstone,''  (<font color='red'><b>the fellow</b></font>)</div>the honest fellow swore,
and always vowed that Mr. Garrick himself would not have had the piece
succeed for the world; and was never in such a rage as during that grand
scene in the second act, where Smith -LRB-poor Hagan-RRB- being bound to the
stake, Pocahontas comes and saves him (<font color='blue'><b>Hagan</b></font>), and when the whole house was
thrilling with applause and sympathy.

<p/>Anybody who has curiosity sufficient, may refer to the published tragedy
-LRB-in the octavo form, or in the subsequent splendid quarto edition of my
Collected Works, and Poems Original and Translated-RRB-, and say whether the
scene is without merit, whether the verses are not elegant, the language
rich and noble? One of the causes of the failure was my actual fidelity
to history. I had copied myself at the Museum, and tinted neatly, a
figure of Sir Walter Raleigh in a frill and beard; and -LRB-my dear Theo
giving some of her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) mother's best lace for the ruff-RRB- we dressed Hagan
accurately after this drawing, and no man could look better. Miss
Pritchard as Pocahontas, I dressed too as a Red Indian, having seen
enough of that costume in my own experience at home. Will it be believed
the house tittered when she (<font color='blue'><b>Pritchard</b></font>) first appeared? They got used to her (<font color='blue'><b>Pritchard</b></font>),
however, but just at the moment when she (<font color='blue'><b>Pritchard</b></font>) rushes into the prisoner's
arms, and a number of people were actually in tears, a fellow in the pit
bawls out, <div class="bookquote">``Bedad! here's the Belle Savage kissing the Saracen's Head;''
 (<font color='red'><b>a fellow</b></font>)</div>on which an impertinent roar of laughter sprang up in the pit, breaking
out with fitful explosions during the remainder of the performance.
As the wag in Mr. Sheridan's amusing Critic admirably says about the
morning guns, the playwrights were not content with one of them, but
must fire two or three; so with this wretched pothouse joke of the Belle
Savage -LRB-the ignorant people not knowing that Pocahontas herself was the
very Belle Sauvage from whom the tavern took its name!-RRB-. My friend of
the pit repeated it ad nauseam during the performance, and as each
new character appeared, saluted him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) by the name of some tavern--for
instance, the English governor -LRB-with a long beard-RRB- he (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>) called the Goat
and Boots; his (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>) lieutenant -LRB-Barker-RRB-, whose face certainly was broad, the
Bull and Mouth, and so on! And the curtain descended amidst a shrill
storm of whistles and hisses, which especially assailed poor Hagan every
time he (<font color='blue'><b>Hagan</b></font>) opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Hagan</b></font>) lips. Sampson saw Master Will in the green boxes,
with some pretty acquaintances of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>), and has no doubt that the
treacherous scoundrel was one of the ringleaders in the conspiracy. <div class="bookquote">``I
would have flung him (<font color='blue'><b>Savage</b></font>) over into the pit,''  (<font color='red'><b>faithful</b></font>)</div>the faithful fellow said -LRB-and
Sampson was man enough to execute his (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) threat-RRB-, <div class="bookquote">``but I saw a couple of
Mr. Nadab's followers prowling about the lobby, and was obliged to sheer
off.''  (<font color='red'><b>Sampson man</b></font>)</div>And so the eggs we had counted on selling at market were broken,
and our poor hopes lay shattered before us!

<p/>I looked in at the house from the stage before the curtain was lifted,
and saw it pretty well filled, especially remarking Mr. Johnson in the
front boxes, in a laced waistcoat, having his (<font color='blue'><b>Johnson</b></font>) friend Mr. Reynolds by his (<font color='blue'><b>Johnson</b></font>)
side; the latter could not hear, and the former could not see, and so
they came good-naturedly A deux to form an opinion of my poor tragedy.
I could see Lady Maria -LRB-I knew the hood she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) wore-RRB- in the lower gallery,
where she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) once more had the opportunity of sitting and looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>)
beloved actor performing a principal character in a piece. As for Theo,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) fairly owned that, unless I ordered her (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) had rather not be
present, nor had I any such command to give, for, if things went wrong,
I knew that to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) suffer would be intolerable pain to myself, and
so acquiesced in her (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) desire to keep away.

<p/>Being of a pretty equanimous disposition, and, as I flatter myself, able
to bear good or evil fortune without disturbance, I myself, after taking
a light dinner at the Bedford, went to the theatre a short while before
the commencement of the play, and proposed to remain there, until the
defeat or victory was decided. I own now, I could not help seeing which
way the fate of the day was likely to turn. There was something
gloomy and disastrous in the general aspect of all things around. Miss
Pritchard had the headache: the barber who brought home Hagan's wig
had powdered it like a wretch: amongst the gentlemen and ladies in
the greenroom, I saw none but doubtful faces: and the manager -LRB-a very
flippant, not to say impertinent gentleman, in my opinion, and who
himself on that night looked as dismal as a mute at a funeral-RRB- had the
insolence to say to me, <div class="bookquote">``For Heaven's sake, Mr. Warrington, go and get
a glass of punch at the Bedford, and don't frighten us all here by your
dismal countenance!''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>says I, <div class="bookquote">``I have a right, for five shillings, to comment upon your
face, but I never gave you any authority to make remarks upon mine.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>says he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) in a pet, <div class="bookquote">``I most heartily wish I had never seen your
face at all!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yours, sir!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, <div class="bookquote">``has often amused me greatly; and
when painted for Abel Drugger is exceedingly comic'' (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>--and indeed I
have always done Mr. G. the justice to think that in low comedy he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) was
unrivalled. I made him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) a bow, and walked off to the coffee-house,
and for five years after never spoke a word to the gentleman, when he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
apologised to me, at a nobleman's house where we chanced to meet. I said
I had utterly forgotten the circumstance to which he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) alluded, and that,
on the first night of a play, no doubt author and manager were flurried
alike. And added, <div class="bookquote">``After all, there is no shame in not being made for
the theatre. Mr. Garrick--you were.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>A compliment with which he (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) appeared
to be as well pleased as I intended he (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) should.

<p/>Fidus Achates ran over to me at the end of the first act to say that all
things were going pretty well; though he (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) confessed to the titter in the
house upon Miss Pritchard's first appearance, dressed exactly like an
Indian princess.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I cannot help it, Sampson,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>said I -LRB-filling him (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) a bumper of good
punch-RRB-, <div class="bookquote">``if Indians are dressed so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>says he (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``would you have had Caractacus painted blue like an
ancient Briton, or Bonduca with nothing but a cow-skin?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And indeed it
may be that the fidelity to history was the cause of the ridicule cast
on my tragedy, in which case I, for one, am not ashamed of its defeat.

<p/>After the second act, my aide-de-camp came from the field with dismal
news indeed. I don't know how it is that, nervous before action,
in disaster I become pretty cool and cheerful. -LSB-The writer seems to
contradict himself here, having just boasted of possessing a pretty
equanimous disposition. He (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) was probably mistaken in his (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) own estimate of
himself, as other folks have been besides.-ED.-RSB- <div class="bookquote">``Are things going ill?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>says I. I call for my reckoning, put on my hat, and march to the theatre
as calmly as if I was going to dine at the Temple; fidus Achates walking
by my side, pressing my elbow, kicking the link-boys out of the way, and
crying, <div class="bookquote">``By George, Mr. Warrington, you are a man of spirit--a Trojan,
sir!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>So, there were men of spirit in Troy; but alas! fate was too
strong for them.

<p/>At any rate, no man can say that I did not bear my misfortune with
calmness: I could no more help the clamour and noise of the audience
than a captain can help the howling and hissing of the storm in which
his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) ship goes down. But I was determined that the rushing waves and
broken masts should impavidum ferient, and flatter myself that I bore my
calamity without flinching. <div class="bookquote">``Not Regulus, my dear madam, could step into
his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) barrel more coolly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sampson/Mr. Sampson</b></font>)</div>Sampson said to my wife. `Tis unjust to say
of men of the parasitic nature that they are unfaithful in misfortune.
Whether I was prosperous or poor, the wild parson was equally true and
friendly, and shared our crust as eagerly as ever he (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) had partaken of our
better fortune.

<p/>I took my place on the stage, whence I could see the actors of my poor
piece, and a portion of the audience who condemned me. I suppose the
performers gave me a wide berth out of pity for me. I must say that I
think I was as little moved as any spectator; and that no one would have
judged from my mien that I was the unlucky hero of the night.

<p/>But my dearest Theo, when I went home, looked so pale and white, that
I saw from the dear creature's countenance that the knowledge of my
disaster had preceded my return. Spencer, Sampson, cousin Hagan, and
Lady Maria were to come after the play, and congratulate the author, God
wot! -LRB-Poor Miss Pritchard was engaged to us likewise, but sent word
that I must understand that she (<font color='blue'><b>Pritchard</b></font>) was a great deal too unwell to sup that
night.-RRB- My friend the gardener of Bedford House had given my wife his (<font color='blue'><b>House</b></font>)
best flowers to decorate her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) little table. There they were; the poor
little painted standards--and the battle lost! I had borne the defeat
well enough, but as I looked at the sweet pale face of the wife across
the table, and those artless trophies of welcome which she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had set up
for her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) hero, I confess my courage gave way, and my heart felt a pang
almost as keen as any that ever has smitten it.

<p/>Our meal, it may be imagined, was dismal enough, nor was it rendered
much gayer by the talk we strove to carry on. Old Mrs. Hagan was,
luckily, very ill at this time; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Hagan</b></font>) disease, and the incidents
connected with it, a great blessing to us. Then we had his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) Majesty's
approaching marriage, about which there was a talk. -LRB-How well I remember
the most futile incidents of the day down to a tune which a carpenter
was whistling by my side at the playhouse, just before the dreary
curtain fell!-RRB- Then we talked about the death of good Mr. Richardson,
the author of Pamela and Clarissa, whose works we all admired
exceedingly. And as we talked about Clarissa, my wife took on herself to
wipe her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) eyes once or twice, and say, faintly, <div class="bookquote">``You know, my love,
mamma and I could never help crying over that dear book. Oh, my dearest,
dearest mother''  (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div>-LRB-she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) adds-RRB-, <div class="bookquote">``how I wish she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) could be with me now!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>This
was an occasion for more open tears, for of course a young lady may
naturally weep for her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) absent mother. And then we mixed a gloomy bowl
with Jamaica limes, and drank to the health of his (<font color='blue'><b>Richardson</b></font>) Excellency the
Governor: and then, for a second toast, I filled a bumper, and, with a
smiling face, drank to <div class="bookquote">``our better fortune!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>This was too much. The two women flung themselves into each other's
arms, and irrigated each other's neck-handkerchiefs with tears. <div class="bookquote">``Oh,
Maria! Is not--is not my George good and kind?''  (<font color='red'><b>sobs Theo</b></font>)</div>sobs Theo. <div class="bookquote">``Look at my
Hagan--how great, how godlike he (<font color='blue'><b>Hagan</b></font>) was in his (<font color='blue'><b>Hagan</b></font>) part!''  (<font color='red'><b>Maria/Lady Maria/Lady Maria Esmond</b></font>)</div>gasps Maria. <div class="bookquote">``It was
a beastly cabal which threw him (<font color='blue'><b>Hagan</b></font>) over--and I could plunge this knife into
Mr. Garrick's black heart--the odious little wretch!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) grasps
a weapon at her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) side. But throwing it presently down, the enthusiastic
creature rushes up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) lord and master, flings her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) arms round him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>),
and embraces him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) in the presence of the little company.

<p/>I am not sure whether some one else did not do likewise. We were all
in a state of extreme excitement and enthusiasm. In the midst of grief,
Love the consoler appears amongst us, and soothes us with such fond
blandishments and tender caresses, that one scarce wishes the calamity
away. Two or three days afterwards, on our birthday, a letter was
brought me in my study, which contained the following lines:--


<p/>``FROM POCAHONTAS

<p/>``Returning from the cruel fight
How pale and faint appears my knight!
He (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) sees me anxious at his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) side;
`Why seek, my love, your wounds to hide?
Or deem your English girl afraid
To emulate the Indian maid?'

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Be mine my husband's grief to cheer,
In peril to be ever near;
Whate’er of ill or woe betide,
To bear it clinging at his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) side;
The poisoned stroke of fate to ward,
His (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) bosom with my own to guard;
Ah! could it spare a pang to his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>),
It could not know a purer bliss!
`Twould gladden as it felt the smart,
And thank the hand that flung the dart!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I do not say the verses are very good, but that I like them as well as
if they were--and that the face of the writer -LRB-whose sweet young voice I
fancy I can hear as I hum the lines-RRB-, when I went into her (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>) drawing-room
after getting the letter, and when I saw her (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>) blushing and blessing
me--seemed to me more beautiful than any I can fancy out of Heaven.




<p/>CHAPTER LXXXI. Res Angusta Domi


<p/>I have already described my present feelings as an elderly gentleman,
regarding that rash jump into matrimony, which I persuaded my dear
partner to take with me when we were both scarce out of our teens. As a
man and a father--with a due sense of the necessity of mutton chops, and
the importance of paying the baker--with a pack of rash children round
about us who might be running off to Scotland to-morrow, and pleading
papa's and mamma's example for their impertinence,--I know that I ought
to be very cautious in narrating this early part of the married life
of George Warrington, Esquire, and Theodosia his (<font color='blue'><b>Theodosia</b></font>) wife--to call out
mea culpa, and put on a demure air, and, sitting in my comfortable
easy-chair here, profess to be in a white sheet and on the stool of
repentance, offering myself up as a warning to imprudent and hot-headed
youth.

<p/>But, truth to say, that married life, regarding which my dear relatives
prophesied so gloomily, has disappointed all those prudent and
respectable people. It has had its trials; but I can remember them
without bitterness--its passionate griefs, of which time, by God's kind
ordinance, has been the benign consoler--its days of poverty, which
we bore, who endured it, to the wonder of our sympathising relatives
looking on--its precious rewards and blessings, so great that I scarce
dare to whisper them to this page; to speak of them, save with awful
respect and to One Ear, to which are offered up the prayers and thanks
of all men. To marry without a competence is wrong and dangerous,
no doubt, and a crime against our social codes; but do not scores of
thousands of our fellow-beings commit the crime every year with no
other trust but in, Heaven, health, and their labour? Are young people
entering into the married life not to take hope into account, nor dare
to begin their housekeeping until the cottage is completely furnished,
the cellar and larder stocked, the cupboard full of plate, and the
strong-box of money? The increase and multiplication of the world would
stop, were the laws which regulate the genteel part of it to be made
universal. Our gentlefolks tremble at the brink in their silk stockings
and pumps, and wait for whole years, until they find a bridge or a gilt
barge to carry them across; our poor do not fear to wet their bare feet,
plant them in the brook, and trust to fate and strength to bear them
over. Who would like to consign his (<font color='blue'><b>Our</b></font>) daughter to poverty? Who would
counsel his (<font color='blue'><b>Our</b></font>) son to undergo the countless risks of poor married life, to
remove the beloved girl from comfort and competence, and subject her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
to debt, misery, privation, friendlessness, sickness, and the hundred
gloomy consequences of the res angusta domi? I look at my own wife and
ask her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) pardon for having imposed a task so fraught with pain and danger
upon one so gentle. I think of the trials she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) endured, and am thankful
for them and for that unfailing love and constancy with which God
blessed her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) and strengthened her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) to bear them all. On this question of
marriage, I am not a fair judge: my own was so imprudent--and has been
so happy, that I must not dare to give young people counsel. I have
endured poverty, but scarcely ever found it otherwise than tolerable:
had I not undergone it, I never could have known the kindness of
friends, the delight of gratitude, the surprising joys and consolations
which sometimes accompany the scanty meal and narrow fire, and cheer the
long day's labour. This at least is certain, in respect of the lot of
the decent poor, that a great deal of superfluous pity is often thrown
away upon it. Good-natured fine folks, who sometimes stepped out of the
sunshine of their riches into a narrow obscurity, were blinded as it
were, whilst we could see quite cheerfully and clearly: they stumbled
over obstacles which were none to us: they were surprised at the
resignation with which we drank small beer, and that we could heartily
say grace over such very cold mutton.

<p/>The good General, my father-in-law, had married his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) Molly, when he (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) was a
subaltern of a foot regiment, and had a purse scarce better filled than
my own. They had had their ups and downs of fortune. I think -LRB-though my
wife will never confess to this point-RRB- they had married, as people could
do in their young time, without previously asking papa's and mamma's
leave. -LSB-The Editor has looked through Burn's Registers of Fleet
Marriages without finding the names of Martin Lambert and Mary Benson.-RSB-
At all events, they were so well pleased with their own good luck in
matrimony, that they did not grudge their children's, and were by no
means frightened at the idea of any little hardships which we in the
course of our married life might be called upon to undergo. And I
suppose when I made my own pecuniary statements to Mr. Lambert, I was
anxious to deceive both of us. Believing me to be master of a couple
of thousand pounds, he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) went to Jamaica quite easy in his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) mind as to his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>)
darling daughter's comfort and maintenance, at least for some years to
come. After paying the expenses of his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) family's outfit, the worthy man
went away not much richer than his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) son-in-law; and a few trinkets, and
some lace of Aunt Lambert's, with twenty new guineas in a purse which
her (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) mother and sisters made for her (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>), were my Theo's marriage portion.
But in valuing my stock, I chose to count as a good debt a sum which my
honoured mother never could be got to acknowledge up to the day when the
resolute old lady was called to pay the last debt of all. The sums I
had disbursed for her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) argued, were spent for the improvement and
maintenance of the estate which was to be mine at her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) decease. What
money she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) could spare was to be for my poor brother, who had nothing,
who would never have spent his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) own means had he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) not imagined himself to
be sole heir of the Virginian property, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Virginian</b></font>) would have been--the good
lady took care to emphasise this point in many of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) letters--but for a
half-hour's accident of birth. He (<font color='blue'><b>Virginian</b></font>) was now distinguishing himself in
the service of his (<font color='blue'><b>Virginian</b></font>) king and country. To purchase his (<font color='blue'><b>Virginian</b></font>) promotion was his (<font color='blue'><b>Virginian</b></font>)
mother's, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) should suppose his (<font color='blue'><b>Virginian</b></font>) brother's duty! When I had finished my
bar-studies and my dramatic amusements, Madam Esmond informed me that I
was welcome to return home and take that place in our colony to which my
birth entitled me. This statement she (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) communicated to me more than once
through Mountain, and before the news of my marriage had reached her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>).

<p/>There is no need to recall her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) expressions of maternal indignation when
she (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) was informed of the step I had taken. On the pacification of Canada,
my dear Harry asked for leave of absence, and dutifully paid a visit to
Virginia. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wrote, describing his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) reception at home, and the splendid
entertainments which my mother made in honour of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) son. Castlewood,
which she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had not inhabited since our departure for Europe, was thrown
open again to our friends of the colony; and the friend of Wolfe, and
the soldier of Quebec, was received by all our acquaintance with every
becoming honour. Some dismal quarrels, to be sure, ensued, because my
brother persisted in maintaining his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) friendship with Colonel Washington,
of Mount Vernon, whose praises Harry never was tired of singing.
Indeed I allow the gentleman every virtue; and in the struggles which
terminated so fatally for England a few years since, I can admire as
well as his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) warmest friends, General Washington's glorious constancy and
success.

<p/>If these battles between Harry and our mother were frequent, as, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
letters, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) described them to be, I wondered, for my part, why he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) should
continue at home? One reason naturally suggested itself to my mind,
which I scarcely liked to communicate to Mrs. Warrington; for we had
both talked over our dear little Hetty's romantic attachment for my
brother, and wondered that he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) had never discovered it. I need not say, I
suppose, that my gentleman had found some young lady at home more to his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
taste than our dear Hester, and hence accounted for his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) prolonged stay
in Virginia.

<p/>Presently there came, in a letter from him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>), not a full confession but an
admission of this interesting fact. A person was described, not named--a
Being all beauty and perfection, like other young ladies under similar
circumstances. My wife asked to see the letter: I could not help showing
it, and handed it to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), with a very sad face. To my surprise she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) read
it, without exhibiting any corresponding sorrow of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) own.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have thought of this before, my love,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said. <div class="bookquote">``I feel with you for
your disappointment regarding poor Hetty.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! poor Hetty,''  (<font color='red'><b>Theo/Lady Theo</b></font>)</div>says Theo, looking down at the carpet.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It would never have done,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>says I.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No--they would not have been happy,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>sighs Theo.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How strange he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) never should have found out her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) secret!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I continued.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) looked me full in the face with an odd expression. <div class="bookquote">``Pray, what does
that look mean?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing, my dear--nothing! only I am not surprised!''  (<font color='red'><b>Theo</b></font>)</div>says Theo,
blushing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I ask, <div class="bookquote">``can there be another?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sure I never said so, George,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>says the lady, hurriedly. <div class="bookquote">``But if
Hetty has overcome her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) childish folly, ought we not all to be glad? Do
you gentlemen suppose that you only are to fall in love and grow tired,
indeed?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I say, with a strange commotion of my mind. <div class="bookquote">``Do you mean to tell
me, Theo, that you ever cared for any one but me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, George,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) whimpers, <div class="bookquote">``when I was at school, there was--there was
one of the boys of Doctor Backhouse's school, who sate in the loft next
to us; and I thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) had lovely eyes, and I was so shocked when I
recognised him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) behind the counter at Mr. Grigg's the mercer's, when I
went to buy a cloak for baby, and I wanted to tell you, my dear, and I
didn't know how!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>I went to see this creature with the lovely eyes, having made my wife
describe the fellow's dress to me, and I saw a little bandy-legged
wretch in a blue camlet coat, with his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) red hair tied with a dirty
ribbon, about whom I forbore generously even to reproach my wife; nor
will she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) ever know that I have looked at the fellow, until she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) reads the
confession in this page. If our wives saw us as we are, I thought, would
they love us as they do? Are we as much mistaken in them, as they in us?
I look into one candid face at least, and think it never has deceived
me.

<p/>Lest I should encourage my young people to an imitation of my own
imprudence, I will not tell them with how small a capital Mrs. Theo and
I commenced life. The unfortunate tragedy brought us nothing; though the
reviewers, since its publication of late, have spoken not unfavourably
as to its merits, and Mr. Kemble himself has done me the honour to
commend it. Our kind friend Lord Wrotham was for having the piece
published by subscription, and sent me a bank-note, with a request that
I would let him (<font color='blue'><b>Wrotham</b></font>) have a hundred copies for his (<font color='blue'><b>Wrotham</b></font>) friends; but I was always
averse to that method of levying money, and, preferring my poverty sine
dote, locked up my manuscript, with my poor girl's verses inserted at
the first page. I know not why the piece should have given such offence
at court, except for the fact that an actor who had run off with an
earl's daughter, performed a principal part in the play; but I was told
that sentiments which I had put into the mouths of some of the Indian
characters -LRB-who were made to declaim against ambition, the British
desire of rule, and so forth-RRB-, were pronounced dangerous and
unconstitutional; so that the little hope of royal favour, which I might
have had, was quite taken away from me.

<p/>What was to be done? A few months after the failure of the tragedy, as
I counted up the remains of my fortune -LRB-the calculation was not long or
difficult-RRB-, I came to the conclusion that I must beat a retreat out
of my pretty apartments in Bloomsbury, and so gave warning to our good
landlady, informing her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) that my wife's health required that we should
have lodgings in the country. But we went no farther than Lambeth, our
faithful Gumbo and Molly following us; and here, though as poor as might
be, we were waited on by a maid and a lackey in livery, like any folks
of condition. You may be sure kind relatives cried out against our
extravagance; indeed, are they not the people who find our faults out
for us, and proclaim them to the rest of the world?

<p/>Returning home from London one day, whither I had been on a visit to
some booksellers, I recognised the family arms and livery on a grand
gilt chariot which stood before a public-house near to our lodgings. A
few loitering inhabitants were gathered round the splendid vehicle, and
looking with awe at the footmen, resplendent in the sun, and quaffing
blazing pots of beer. I found my Lady Castlewood seated opposite to
my wife in our little apartment -LRB-whence we had a very bright, pleasant
prospect of the river, covered with barges and wherries, and the ancient
towers and trees of the Archbishop's palace and gardens-RRB-, and Mrs. Theo,
who has a very droll way of describing persons and scenes, narrated to
me all the particulars of her (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) ladyship's conversation, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) took her (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>)
leave.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have been here this ever-so-long,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Countess</b></font>)</div>says the Countess, <div class="bookquote">``gossiping with
cousin Theo, while you have been away at the coffee-house, I dare say,
making merry with your friends, and drinking your punch and coffee.
Guess she (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) must find it rather lonely here, with nothing to do but work
them little caps and hem them frocks. Never mind, dear; reckon you'll
soon have a companion who will amuse you when cousin George is away at
his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) coffee-house! What a nice lodging you have got here, I do declare!
Our new house which we have took is twenty times as big, and covered
with gold from top to bottom; but I like this quite as well. Bless you
being rich is no better than being poor. When we lived to Albany, and
I did most all the work myself, scoured the rooms, biled the kettle,
helped the wash, and all, I was just as happy as I am now. We only
had one old negro to keep the store. Why don't you sell Gumbo, cousin
George? He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) ain't no use here idling and dawdling about, and making love
to the servant-girl. Fogh! guess they ain't particular, these English
people!''  (<font color='red'><b>the Countess</b></font>)</div>So she (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) talked, rattling on with perfect good-humour, until her (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>)
hour for departure came; when she (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) produced a fine repeating watch, and
said it was time for her (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) to pay a call upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) Majesty at Buckingham
House. <div class="bookquote">``And mind you come to us, George,''  (<font color='red'><b>ladyship</b></font>)</div>says her (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) ladyship, waving a
little parting hand out of the gilt coach. <div class="bookquote">``Theo and I have settled all
about it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Here, at least,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, when the laced footmen had clambered up behind
the carriage, and our magnificent little patroness had left us;--<div class="bookquote">``here
is one who is not afraid of our poverty, nor ashamed to remember her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)
own.''

 (<font color='red'><b>patroness</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ashamed!''  (<font color='red'><b>Theo/Lady Theo</b></font>)</div>said Theo, resuming her (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) lilliputian needlework. <div class="bookquote">``To do her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)
justice, she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) would make herself at home in any kitchen or palace in the
world. She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) has given me and Molly twenty lessons in housekeeping. She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)
says, when she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) was at home to Albany, she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) roasted, baked, swept the
house, and milked the cow.''  (<font color='red'><b>Madam Theo</b></font>)</div>-LRB-Madam Theo pronounced the word cow
archly in our American way, and imitated her (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) ladyship's accent very
divertingly.-RRB-

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) has no pride,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I added. <div class="bookquote">``It was good-natured of her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) to ask us
to dine with her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) and my lord. When will Uncle Warrington ever think of
offering us a crust again, or a glass of his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) famous beer?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, it was not ill-natured to invite us,''  (<font color='red'><b>Theo/Lady Theo</b></font>)</div>says Theo, slily. <div class="bookquote">``But,
my dear, you don't know all the conditions!''  (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div>And then my wife, still
imitating the Countess's manner, laughingly informed me what these
conditions were. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) took out her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) pocket-book, and told me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Theo/Lady Theo</b></font>)</div>says Theo,
<div class="bookquote">``what days she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) was engaged abroad and at home. On Monday she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) received a
Duke and a Duchess, with several other members of my lord's house,
and their ladies. On Tuesday came more earls, two bishops, and an
ambassador. `Of course you won't come on them days?' says the Countess.
`Now you are so poor, you know, that fine company ain't no good for you.
Lord bless you! father never dines on our company days! he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) don't
like it; he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) takes a bit of cold meat anyways.' On which,''  (<font color='red'><b>Theo/Lady Theo</b></font>)</div>says Theo,
laughing, <div class="bookquote">``I told her (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) that Mr. Warrington did not care for any but the
best of company, and proposed that she (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) should ask us on some day when
the Archbishop of Canterbury dined with her (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>), and his (<font color='blue'><b>Archbishop</b></font>) Grace must give
us a lift home in his (<font color='blue'><b>Archbishop</b></font>) coach to Lambeth. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Grace</b></font>) is an economical little
person, too,''  (<font color='red'><b>Theo/Lady Theo</b></font>)</div>continues Theo. ```I thought of bringing with me some of
my baby's caps and things, which his (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) lordship has outgrown `em, but they
may be wanted again, you know, my dear.' And so we lose that addition
to our wardrobe,'' says Theo, smiling, <div class="bookquote">``and Molly and I must do our best
without her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) ladyship's charity. `When people are poor, they are poor,'
the Countess said, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) usual outspokenness, `and must get on the
best they can. What we shall do for that poor Maria, goodness only
knows! we can't ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) to see us as we can you, though you are so
poor: but an earl's daughter to marry a play-actor! La, my dear, it's
dreadful: his (<font color='blue'><b>earl</b></font>) Majesty and the Princess have both spoken of it! Every
other noble family in this kingdom as has ever heard of it pities us;
though I have a plan for helping those poor unhappy people, and have
sent down Simons, my groom of the chambers, to tell them on it.' This
plan was, that Hagan, who had kept almost all his (<font color='blue'><b>Hagan</b></font>) terms at Dublin
College, should return thither and take his (<font color='blue'><b>Hagan</b></font>) degree, and enter into holy
orders, `when we will provide him (<font color='blue'><b>Hagan</b></font>) with a chaplaincy at home, you know,'
Lady Castlewood added.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>And I may mention here, that this benevolent
plan was executed a score of months later; when I was enabled myself to
be of service to Mr. Hagan, who was one of the kindest and best of
our friends during our own time of want and distress. Castlewood
then executed his (<font color='blue'><b>Hagan</b></font>) promise loyally enough, got orders and a colonial
appointment for Hagan, who distinguished himself both as soldier and
preacher, as we shall presently hear; but not a guinea did his (<font color='blue'><b>Hagan</b></font>) lordship
spare to aid either his (<font color='blue'><b>Hagan</b></font>) sister or his (<font color='blue'><b>Hagan</b></font>) kinsman in their trouble. I never
asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Hagan</b></font>), thank Heaven, to assist me in my own; though, to do him (<font color='blue'><b>Hagan</b></font>)
justice, no man could express himself more amiably, and with a joy which
I believe was quite genuine, when my days of poverty were ended.

<p/>As for my Uncle Warrington, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) virtuous wife and daughters, let
me do them justice likewise, and declare that throughout my period of
trial, their sorrow at my poverty was consistent and unvarying. I still
had a few acquaintances who saw them, and of course -LRB-as friends will-RRB-
brought me a report of their opinions and conversation; and I never
could hear that my relatives had uttered one single good word about me
or my wife. They spoke even of my tragedy as a crime--I was accustomed
to hear that sufficiently maligned--of the author as a miserable
reprobate, for ever reeling about Grub Street, in rags and squalor. They
held me out no hand of help. My poor wife might cry in her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) pain,
but they had no twopence to bestow upon her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>). They went to church a
half-dozen times in the week. They subscribed to many public charities.
Their tribe was known eighteen hundred years ago, and will flourish as
long as men endure. They will still thank Heaven that they are not as
other folks are; and leave the wounded and miserable to other succour.

<p/>I don't care to recall the dreadful doubts and anxieties which began to
beset me; the plan after plan which I tried, and in which I failed, for
procuring work and adding to our dwindling stock of money. I bethought
me of my friend Mr. Johnson, and when I think of the eager kindness with
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Johnson</b></font>) received me, am ashamed of some pert speeches which I own
to have made regarding his (<font color='blue'><b>Johnson</b></font>) manners and behaviour. I told my story and
difficulties to him (<font color='blue'><b>Johnson</b></font>), the circumstance of my marriage, and the prospects
before me. He (<font color='blue'><b>Johnson</b></font>) would not for a moment admit they were gloomy, or, si male
nunc, that they would continue to be so. I had before me the chances,
certainly very slender, of a place in England; the inheritance which
must be mine in the course of nature, or at any rate would fall to the
heir I was expecting. I had a small stock of money for present actual
necessity--a possibility, <div class="bookquote">``though, to be free with you, sir''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>-LRB-says
he (<font color='blue'><b>heir</b></font>)-RRB-, <div class="bookquote">``after the performance of your tragedy, I doubt whether nature
has endowed you with those peculiar qualities which are necessary for
achieving a remarkable literary success'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--and finally a submission to
the maternal rule, and a return to Virginia, where plenty and a home
were always ready for me. <div class="bookquote">``Why, sir!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>heir</b></font>) cried, <div class="bookquote">``such a sum as you
mention would have been a fortune to me when I began the world, and my
friend Mr. Goldsmith would set up a coach-and-six on it. With youth,
hope, to-day, and a couple of hundred pounds in cash--no young fellow
need despair. Think, sir, you have a year at least before you, and who
knows what may chance between now and then. Why, sir, your relatives
here may provide for you, or you may succeed to your Virginian property,
or you may come into a fortune!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>I did not in the course of that year,
but he (<font color='blue'><b>heir</b></font>) did. My Lord Bute gave Mr. Johnson a pension, which set all Grub
Street in a fury against the recipient, who, to be sure, had published
his (<font color='blue'><b>Bute</b></font>) own not very flattering opinion upon pensions and pensioners.

<p/>Nevertheless, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bute</b></font>) did not altogether discourage my literary projects,
promised to procure me work from the booksellers, and faithfully
performed that kind promise. <div class="bookquote">``But,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>says he (<font color='blue'><b>Bute</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``sir, you must not appear
amongst them in forma pauperis.--Have you never a friend's coach, in
which we can ride to see them? You must put on your best laced hat and
waistcoat; and we must appear, sir, as if we were doing them a favour.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>This stratagem answered, and procured me respect enough at the first
visit or two; but when the booksellers knew that I wanted to be paid for
my work, their backs refused to bend any more, and they treated me with
a familiarity which I could ill stomach. I overheard one of them, who
had been a footman, say, <div class="bookquote">``Oh, it's Pocahontas, is it? let him (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) wait.''  (<font color='red'><b>a footman</b></font>)</div>And
he (<font color='blue'><b>footman</b></font>) told his (<font color='blue'><b>footman</b></font>) boy to say as much to me. <div class="bookquote">``Wait, sir?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>says I, fuming
with rage and putting my head into his (<font color='blue'><b>footman</b></font>) parlour, <div class="bookquote">``I'm not accustomed to
waiting, but I have heard you are.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>And I strode out of the shop into
Pall Mall in a mighty fluster.

<p/>And yet Mr. D. was in the right. I came to him (<font color='blue'><b>D.</b></font>), if not to ask a favour,
at any rate to propose a bargain, and surely it was my business to wait
his (<font color='blue'><b>D.</b></font>) time and convenience. In more fortunate days I asked the gentleman's
pardon, and the kind author of the Muse in Livery was instantly
appeased.

<p/>I was more prudent, or Mr. Johnson more fortunate, in an application
elsewhere, and Mr. Johnson procured me a little work from the
booksellers in translating from foreign languages, of which I happen to
know two or three. By a hard day's labour I could earn a few shillings;
so few that a week's work would hardly bring me a guinea: and that was
flung to me with insolent patronage by the low hucksters who employed
me. I can put my finger upon two or three magazine articles written at
this period, and paid for with a few wretched shillings, which papers as
I read them awaken in me the keenest pangs of bitter remembrance.
-LSB-Mr. George Warrington, of the Upper Temple, says he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) remembers a book,
containing his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) grandfather's book-plate, in which were pasted various
extracts from reviews and newspapers in an old type, and lettered
outside Les Chains de l’Esclavage. These were no doubt the contributions
above mentioned; but the volume has not been found, either in the
town-house or in the library at Warrington Manor. The Editor, by
the way, is not answerable for a certain inconsistency, which may be
remarked in the narrative. The writer says earlier, that he (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) speaks
without bitterness of past times, and presently falls into a fury with
them. The same manner of forgiving our enemies is not uncommon in the
present century.-RSB- I recall the doubts and fears which agitated me,
see the dear wife nursing her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) infant and looking up into my face with
hypocritical smiles that vainly try to mask her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) alarm: the struggles of
pride are fought over again: the wounds under which I smarted re-open.
There are some acts of injustice committed against me which I don't know
how to forgive; and which, whenever I think of them, awaken in me the
same feelings of revolt and indignation. The gloom and darkness gather
over me--till they are relieved by a reminiscence of that love and
tenderness which through all gloom and darkness have been my light and
consolation.




<p/>CHAPTER LXXXII. Miles's Moidore


<p/>Little Miles made his (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) appearance in this world within a few days of the
gracious Prince who commands his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) regiment. Illuminations and cannonading
saluted the Royal George's birth, multitudes were admitted to see him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
as he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) lay behind a gilt railing at the Palace with noble nurses watching
over him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>). Few nurses guarded the cradle of our little Prince; no
courtiers, no faithful retainers saluted it, except our trusty Gumbo
and kind Molly, who to be sure loved and admired the little heir of my
poverty as loyally as our hearts could desire. Why was our boy not named
George like the other paragon just mentioned, and like his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) father? I
gave him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) the name of a little scapegrace of my family, a name which
many generations of Warringtons had borne likewise; but my poor little
Miles's love and kindness touched me at a time when kindness and love
were rare from those of my own blood, and Theo and I agreed that our
child should be called after that single little friend of my paternal
race.

<p/>We wrote to acquaint our royal parents with the auspicious event, and
bravely inserted the child's birth in the Daily Advertiser, and the
place, Church Street, Lambeth, where he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) was born. <div class="bookquote">``My dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Aunt Bernstein</b></font>)</div>says Aunt
Bernstein, writing to me in reply to my announcement, <div class="bookquote">``how could you
point out to all the world that you live in such a trou as that in
which you have buried yourself? I kiss the little mamma, and send a
remembrance for the child.''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>This remembrance was a fine silk coverlid,
with a lace edging fit for a prince. It was not very useful: the price
of the lace would have served us much better, but Theo and Molly were
delighted with the present, and my eldest son's cradle had a cover as
fine as any nobleman's.

<p/>Good Dr. Heberden came over several times to visit my wife, and see that
all things went well. He (<font color='blue'><b>nobleman</b></font>) knew and recommended to us a surgeon in the
vicinage, who took charge of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>); luckily, my dear patient needed little
care, beyond that which our landlady and her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) own trusty attendant could
readily afford her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>). Again our humble precinct was adorned with the
gilded apparition of Lady Castlewood's chariot wheels; she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) brought a pot
of jelly, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) thought Theo might like, and which, no doubt, had
been served at one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) ladyship's banquets on a previous day. And
she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) told us of all the ceremonies at court, and of the splendour and
festivities attending the birth of the august heir to the crown; Our
good Mr. Johnson happened to pay me a visit on one of those days when
my lady countess's carriage flamed up to our little gate. He (<font color='blue'><b>Johnson</b></font>) was not a
little struck by her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) magnificence, and made her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) some bows, which were
more respectful than graceful. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) called me cousin very affably, and
helped to transfer the present of jelly from her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) silver dish into our
crockery pan with much benignity. The Doctor tasted the sweetmeat, and
pronounced it to be excellent. <div class="bookquote">``The great, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>says he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``are fortunate
in every way. They can engage the most skilful practitioners of the
culinary art, as they can assemble the most amiable wits round their
table. If, as you think, sir, and, from the appearance of the dish,
your suggestion at least is plausible, this sweetmeat may have appeared
already at his (<font color='blue'><b>child</b></font>) lordship's table, it has been there in good company. It
has quivered under the eyes of celebrated beauties, it has been tasted
by ruby lips, it has divided the attention of the distinguished company,
with fruits, tarts, and creams, which I make no doubt were like itself
delicious.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And so saying, the good Doctor absorbed a considerable
portion of Lady Castlewood's benefaction; though as regards the epithet
delicious I am bound to say, that my poor wife, after tasting the jelly,
put it away from her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) as not to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) liking; and Molly, flinging up her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
head, declared it was mouldy.

<p/>My boy enjoyed at least the privilege of having an earl's daughter for
his (<font color='blue'><b>earl</b></font>) godmother; for this office was performed by his (<font color='blue'><b>earl</b></font>) cousin, our poor
Lady Maria, whose kindness and attention to the mother and the infant
were beyond all praise; and who, having lost her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) own solitary chance
for maternal happiness, yearned over our child in a manner not a little
touching to behold. Captain Miles is a mighty fine gentleman, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>)
uniforms of the Prince's Hussars as splendid as any that ever bedizened
a soldier of fashion; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) hath too good a heart, and is too true a
gentleman, let us trust, not to be thankful when he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) remembers that his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
own infant limbs were dressed in some of the little garments which had
been prepared for the poor player's child. Sampson christened him (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) in
that very chapel in Southwark, where our marriage ceremony had been
performed. Never were the words of the Prayer-book more beautifully and
impressively read than by the celebrant of the service; except at
its end, when his (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) voice failed him (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) and the rest of the little
congregation were fain to wipe their eyes. <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Garrick himself, sir,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hagan/Mr. Hagan</b></font>)</div>says Hagan, <div class="bookquote">``could not have read those words so nobly. I am sure little
innocent never entered the world accompanied by wishes and benedictions
more tender and sincere.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hagan/Mr. Hagan</b></font>)</div><p/>And now I have not told how it chanced that the Captain came by his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) name
of Miles. A couple of days before his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) christening, when as yet I believe
it was intended that our firstborn should bear his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) father's name, a
little patter of horse's hoofs comes galloping up to our gate; and
who should pull at the bell but young Miles, our cousin? I fear he (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) had
disobeyed his (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) parents when he (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) galloped away on that undutiful journey.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You know,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>says he (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``cousin Harry gave me my little horse; and I can't
help liking you, because you are so like Harry, and because they're
always saying things of you at home, and it's a shame; and I have
brought my whistle and coral that my godmamma Lady Suckling gave me, for
your little boy; and if you're so poor, cousin George, here's my gold
moidore, and it's worth ever so much, and it's no use to me, because I
mayn't spend it, you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>We took the boy up to Theo in her (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) room -LRB-he (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) mounted the stair in his (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>)
little tramping boots, of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) was very proud-RRB-; and Theo kissed him (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>),
and thanked him (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>); and his (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) moidore has been in her (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) purse from that day.

<p/>My mother, writing through her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) ambassador as usual, informed me of
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) royal surprise and displeasure on learning that my son had been
christened Miles--a name not known, at least in the Esmond family. I
did not care to tell the reason at the time; but when, in after years,
I told Madam Esmond how my boy came by his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) name, I saw a tear roll down
her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) wrinkled cheek, and I heard afterwards that she (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) had asked Gumbo
many questions about the boy who gave his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) name to our Miles--our Miles
Gloriosus of Pall Mall, Valenciennes, Almack's, Brighton.




<p/>CHAPTER LXXXIII. Troubles and Consolations


<p/>In our early days at home, when Harry and I used to be so undutiful to
our tutor, who would have thought that Mr. Esmond Warrington of Virginia
would turn Bearleader himself? My mother -LRB-when we came together again-RRB-
never could be got to speak directly of this period of my life; but
would allude to it as <div class="bookquote">``that terrible time, my love, which I can't bear
to think of,''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``those dreadful years when there was difference between
us,''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>and so forth; and though my pupil, a worthy and grateful man, sent
me out to Jamestown several barrels of that liquor by which his (<font color='blue'><b>pupil</b></font>) great
fortune was made, Madam Esmond spoke of him (<font color='blue'><b>pupil</b></font>) as <div class="bookquote">``your friend in England,''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``your wealthy Lambeth friend,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>etc., but never by his (<font color='blue'><b>pupil</b></font>) name; nor did she (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>)
ever taste a drop of his (<font color='blue'><b>pupil</b></font>) beer. We brew our own too at Warrington Manor,
but our good Mr. Foker never fails to ship to Ipswich every year a
couple of butts of his (<font color='blue'><b>Foker</b></font>) entire. His (<font color='blue'><b>Foker</b></font>) son is a young sprig of fashion, and
has married an earl's daughter; the father is a very worthy and kind
gentleman, and it is to the luck of making his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) acquaintance that I owe
the receipt of some of the most welcome guineas that ever I received in
my life.

<p/>It was not so much the sum, as the occupation and hope given me by the
office of Governor, which I took on myself, which were then so precious
to me. Mr. F.'s Brewery -LRB-the site has since been changed-RRB- then stood
near to Pedlar's Acre in Lambeth and the surgeon who attended my wife in
her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) confinement, likewise took care of the wealthy brewer's family.
He (<font color='blue'><b>brewer</b></font>) was a Bavarian, originally named Voelker. Mr. Lance, the surgeon, I
suppose, made him (<font color='blue'><b>Lance</b></font>) acquainted with my name and history. The worthy doctor
would smoke many a pipe of Virginia in my garden, and had conceived an
attachment for me and my family. He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) brought his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) patron to my house; and
when Mr. F. found that I had a smattering of his (<font color='blue'><b>F.</b></font>) language, and could
sing <div class="bookquote">``Prinz Eugen the noble Ritter''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>-LRB-a song that my grandfather had
brought home from the Marlborough wars-RRB-, the German conceived a great
friendship for me: his (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) lady put her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) chair and her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) chariot at Mrs.
Warrington's service: his (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) little daughter took a prodigious fancy to our
baby -LRB-and to do him (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) justice, the Captain, who is as ugly a fellow now
as ever wore a queue, was beautiful as an infant-RRB- -LSB-The very image of the
Squire at 30, everybody says so. M. W. -LRB-Note in the MS.-RRB--RSB-: and his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) son
and heir, Master Foker, being much maltreated at Westminster School
because of his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) father's profession of brewer, the parents asked if
I would take charge of him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>); and paid me a not insufficient sum for
superintending his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) education.

<p/>Mr. F. was a shrewd man of business, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>F.</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>F.</b></font>) family really
interested themselves in me and mine, I laid all my pecuniary affairs
pretty unreservedly before him (<font color='blue'><b>F.</b></font>); and my statement, he (<font color='blue'><b>F.</b></font>) was pleased to say,
augmented the respect and regard which he (<font color='blue'><b>F.</b></font>) felt for me. He (<font color='blue'><b>F.</b></font>) laughed at
our stories of the aid which my noble relatives had given me--my
aunt's coverlid, my Lady Castlewood's mouldy jelly, Lady Warrington's
contemptuous treatment of us. But he (<font color='blue'><b>F.</b></font>) wept many tears over the story of
little Miles's moidore; and as for Sampson and Hagan, <div class="bookquote">``I wow,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hagan/Mr. Hagan</b></font>)</div>says he (<font color='blue'><b>Hagan</b></font>),
<div class="bookquote">``dey shall have so much beer als ever dey can drink.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Hagan</b></font>) sent his (<font color='blue'><b>Hagan</b></font>) wife
to call upon Lady Maria, and treated her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) with the utmost respect and
obsequiousness, whenever she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) came to visit him (<font color='blue'><b>Hagan</b></font>). It was with Mr. Foker
that Lady Maria stayed when Hagan went to Dublin to complete his (<font color='blue'><b>Hagan</b></font>) college
terms; and the good brewer's purse also ministered to our friend's wants
and supplied his (<font color='blue'><b>Hagan</b></font>) outfit.

<p/>When Mr. Foker came fully to know my own affairs and position, he (<font color='blue'><b>Foker</b></font>) was
pleased to speak of me with terms of enthusiasm, and as if my conduct
showed some extraordinary virtue. I have said how my mother saved money
for Harry, and how the two were in my debt. But when Harry spent money,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) spent it fancying it to be his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>); Madam Esmond never could be made to
understand she (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) was dealing hardly with me--the money was paid and gone,
and there was an end of it. Now, at the end of `62, I remember Harry
sent over a considerable remittance for the purchase of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) promotion,
begging me at the same time to remember that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was in my debt, and to
draw on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) agents if I had any need. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) did not know how great the need
was, or how my little capital had been swallowed.

<p/>Well, to take my brother's money would delay his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) promotion, and I
naturally did not draw on him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>), though I own I was tempted; nor, knowing
my dear General Lambert's small means, did I care to impoverish him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) by
asking for supplies. These simple acts of forbearance my worthy brewer
must choose to consider as instances of exalted virtue. And what does
my gentleman do but write privately to my brother in America, lauding me
and my wife as the most admirable of human beings, and call upon
Madame de Bernstein, who never told me of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>) visit indeed, but who,
I perceived, about this time treated us with singular respect and
gentleness, that surprised me in one whom I could not but consider as
selfish and worldly. In after days I remember asking him (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>) how he (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>) had
gained admission to the Baroness? He (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>) laughed: <div class="bookquote">``De Baroness!''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>says he (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``I knew de Baron when he (<font color='blue'><b>Baron</b></font>) was a walet at Munich, and I was a
brewer-apprentice.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I think our family had best not be too curious about
our uncle the Baron.

<p/>Thus, the part of my life which ought to have been most melancholy was
in truth made pleasant by many friends, happy circumstances, and strokes
of lucky fortune. The bear I led was a docile little cub, and danced
to my piping very readily. Better to lead him (<font color='blue'><b>Baron</b></font>) about, than to hang round
booksellers' doors, or wait the pleasure or caprice of managers! My wife
and I, during our exile, as we may call it, spent very many pleasant
evenings with these kind friends and benefactors. Nor were we without
intellectual enjoyments; Mrs. Foker and Mrs. Warrington sang finely
together; and sometimes when I was in the mood, I read my own play of
Pocahontas, to this friendly audience, in a manner better than Hagan's
own, Mr. Foker was pleased to say.

<p/>After that little escapade of Miles Warrington, junior, I saw nothing
of him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>), and heard of my paternal relatives but rarely. Sir Miles was
assiduous at court -LRB-as I believe he (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) would have been at Nero's-RRB-, and
I laughed one day when Mr. Foker told me that he (<font color='blue'><b>Foker</b></font>) had heard on `Change
<div class="bookquote">``that they were going to make my uncle a Beer.'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--<div class="bookquote">``A Beer?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>says I in
wonder. <div class="bookquote">``Can't you understand de vort, ven I say it?''  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>says the testy
old gentleman. <div class="bookquote">``Vell, veil, a Lort!''  (<font color='red'><b>Miles</b></font>)</div>Sir, Miles indeed was the obedient
humble servant of the Minister, whoever he (<font color='blue'><b>Minister</b></font>) might be. I am surprised he (<font color='blue'><b>Minister</b></font>)
did not speak English with a Scotch accent during the first favourite's
brief reign. I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Minister</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Minister</b></font>) wife coming from court, when Mrs.
Claypool was presented to her (<font color='blue'><b>Claypool</b></font>) Majesty on her (<font color='blue'><b>Claypool</b></font>) marriage. I had my little
boy on my shoulder. My uncle and aunt stared resolutely at me from their
gilt coach window. The footmen looked blank over their nosegays. Had I
worn the Fairy's cap and been invisible, my father's brother could not
have passed me with less notice.

<p/>We did not avail ourselves much, or often, of that queer invitation
of Lady Castlewood, to go and drink tea and sup with her (<font color='blue'><b>Castlewood</b></font>) ladyship
when there was no other company. Old Van den Bosch, however shrewd his (<font color='blue'><b>Bosch</b></font>)
intellect, and great his (<font color='blue'><b>Bosch</b></font>) skill in making a fortune, was not amusing
in conversation, except to his (<font color='blue'><b>Bosch</b></font>) daughter, who talked household and City
matters, bulling and bearing, raising and selling farming-stock, and
so forth, quite as keenly and shrewdly as her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) father. Nor was my Lord
Castlewood often at home, or much missed by his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) wife when absent, or
very much at ease in the old father's company. The Countess told all
this to my wife in her (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) simple way. <div class="bookquote">``Guess,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>says she (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``my lord and
father don't pull well together nohow. Guess my lord is always wanting
money, and father keeps the key of the box and quite right, too. If he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
could have the fingering of all our money, my lord would soon make
away with it, and then what's to become of our noble family? We pay
everything, my dear -LRB-except play-debts, and them we won't have nohow-RRB-.
We pay cooks, horses, wine-merchants, tailors, and everybody--and lucky
for them too--reckon my lord wouldn't pay `em! And we always take care
that he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) has a guinea in his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) pocket, and goes out like a real nobleman.
What that man do owe to us: what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did before we come--gracious
goodness only knows! Me and father does our best to make him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
respectable: but it's no easy job, my dear. Law! he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)'d melt the plate,
only father keeps the key of the strong-room; and when we go to
Castlewood, my father travels with me, and papa is armed too, as well as
the people.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Gracious heavens!''  (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div>cries my wife, <div class="bookquote">``your ladyship does not mean to say
you suspect your own husband of a desire to--''

 (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To what?--Oh no, nothing, of course! And I would trust our brother Will
with untold money, wouldn't I? As much as I'd trust the cat with the
cream-pan! I tell you, my dear, it's not all pleasure being a woman of
rank and fashion: and if I have bought a countess's coronet, I have paid
a good price for it--that I have!''

 (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div><p/>And so had my Lord Castlewood paid a large price for having his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) estate
freed from incumbrances, his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) houses and stables furnished, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>)
debts discharged. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) was the slave of the little wife and her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) father.
No wonder the old man's society was not pleasant to the poor victim, and
that he (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>) gladly slunk away from his (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>) own fine house, to feast at the club
when he (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>) had money, or at least to any society save that which he (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>) found
at home. To lead a bear, as I did, was no very pleasant business, to
be sure: to wait in a bookseller's anteroom until it should please his (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>)
honour to finish his (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>) dinner and give me audience, was sometimes a hard
task for a man of my name and with my pride; but would I have exchanged
my poverty against Castlewood's ignominy, or preferred his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) miserable
dependence to my own? At least I earned my wage, such as it was; and no
man can say that I ever flattered my patrons, or was servile to them; or
indeed, in my dealings with them, was otherwise than sulky, overbearing,
and, in a word, intolerable.

<p/>Now there was a certain person with whom Fate had thrown me into a
life-partnership, who bore her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) poverty with such a smiling sweetness
and easy grace, that niggard Fortune relented before her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>), and, like
some savage Ogre in the fairy tales, melted at the constant goodness and
cheerfulness of that uncomplaining, artless, innocent creature. However
poor she (<font color='blue'><b>fairy</b></font>) was, all who knew her (<font color='blue'><b>fairy</b></font>) saw that here was a fine lady; and the
little tradesmen and humble folks round about us treated her (<font color='blue'><b>fairy</b></font>) with as
much respect as the richest of our neighbours. <div class="bookquote">``I think, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Foker</b></font>)</div>says
good-natured Mrs. Foker, when they rode out in the latter's chariot,
<div class="bookquote">``you look like the mistress of the carriage, and I only as your maid.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Foker</b></font>)</div>Our landladies adored her (<font color='blue'><b>Foker</b></font>); the tradesfolk executed her (<font color='blue'><b>Foker</b></font>) little orders
as eagerly as if a duchess gave them, or they were to make a fortune
by waiting on her (<font color='blue'><b>Foker</b></font>). I have thought often of the lady in Comus, and how,
through all the rout and rabble, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) moves, entirely serene and pure.

<p/>Several times, as often as we chose indeed, the good-natured parents of
my young bear lent us their chariot to drive abroad or to call on the
few friends we had. If I must tell the truth, we drove once to the
Protestant Hero and had a syllabub in the garden there: and the
hostess would insist upon calling my wife her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) ladyship during the whole
afternoon. We also visited Mr. Johnson, and took tea with him (<font color='blue'><b>Johnson</b></font>) -LRB-the
ingenious Mr. Goldsmith was of the company-RRB-; the Doctor waited upon my
wife to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) coach. But our most frequent visits were to Aunt Bernstein,
and I promise you I was not at all jealous because my aunt presently
professed to have a wonderful liking for Theo.

<p/>This liking grew so that she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) would have her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) most days in the week, or to
stay altogether with her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>), and thought that Theo's child and husband
were only plagues to be sure, and hated us in the most amusing way
for keeping her (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) favourite from her (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>). Not that my wife was unworthy
of anybody's favour; but her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) many forced absences, and the constant
difficulty of intercourse with her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), raised my aunt's liking for a while
to a sort of passion. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) poured in notes like love-letters; and her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
people were ever about our kitchen. If my wife did not go to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
wrote heartrending appeals, and scolded me severely when I saw her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>); and,
the child being ill once -LRB-it hath pleased Fate to spare our Captain to
be a prodigious trouble to us, and a wholesome trial for our tempers-RRB-,
Madame Bernstein came three days running to Lambeth; vowed there was
nothing the matter with the baby;--nothing at all;--and that we only
pretended his (<font color='blue'><b>Bernstein</b></font>) illness, in order to vex her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>).

<p/>The reigning Countess of Castlewood was just as easy and affable with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) old aunt, as with other folks great and small. <div class="bookquote">``What air you all
about, scraping and bowing to that old woman, I can't tell, noways!''  (<font color='red'><b>ladyship</b></font>)</div>her (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>)
ladyship would say. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) a fine lady! Nonsense! She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) ain't no more fine
than any other lady: and I guess I'm as good as any of `em with their
high heels and their grand airs! She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) a beauty once! Take away her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) wig,
and her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) rouge, and her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) teeth; and what becomes of your beauty, I'd like
to know? Guess you'd put it all in a bandbox, and there would be nothing
left but a shrivelled old woman!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>And indeed the little homilist only
spoke too truly. All beauty must at last come to this complexion; and
decay, either underground or on the tree. Here was old age, I fear,
without reverence. Here were grey hairs, that were hidden or painted.
The world was still here, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) tottering on it, and clinging to it
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) crutch. For fourscore years she (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) had moved on it, and eaten
of the tree, forbidden and permitted. She (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) had had beauty, pleasure,
flattery: but what secret rages, disappointments, defeats, humiliations!
what thorns under the roses! what stinging bees in the fruit! <div class="bookquote">``You are
not a beauty, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) would say to my wife: <div class="bookquote">``and may thank your
stars that you are not.''  (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div>-LRB-If she (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) contradicted herself in her (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) talk, I
suppose the rest of us occasionally do the like.-RRB- <div class="bookquote">``Don't tell me that
your husband is pleased with your face, and you want no one else's
admiration! We all do. Every woman would rather be beautiful than be
anything else in the world--ever so rich, or ever so good, or have all
the gifts of the fairies! Look at that picture, though I know `tis but a
bad one, and that stupid vapouring Kneller could not paint my eyes, nor
my hair, nor my complexion. What a shape I had then--and look at me now,
and this wrinkled old neck! Why have we such a short time of our beauty?
I remember Mademoiselle de l’Enclos at a much greater age than mine,
quite fresh and well-conserved. We can't hide our ages. They are wrote
in Mr. Collins's books for us. I was born in the last year of King
James's reign. I am not old yet. I am but seventy-six. But what a wreck,
my dear: and isn't it cruel that our time should be so short?''

 (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div><p/>Here my wife has to state the incontrovertible proposition, that the
time of all of us is short here below.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ha!''  (<font color='red'><b>the Baroness</b></font>)</div>cries the Baroness. <div class="bookquote">``Did not Adam live near a thousand years, and
was not Eve beautiful all the time? I used to perplex Mr. Tusher with
that--poor creature! What have we done since, that our lives are so much
lessened, I say?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Has your life been so happy that you would prolong it ever so much
more?''  (<font color='red'><b>the Baroness</b></font>)</div>asks the Baroness's auditor. <div class="bookquote">``Have you, who love wit, never read
Dean Swift's famous description of the deathless people in Gulliver? My
papa and my husband say `tis one of the finest and most awful sermons
ever wrote. It were better not to live at all, than to live without
love; and I'm sure,''  (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div>says my wife, putting her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) handkerchief to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) eyes,
<div class="bookquote">``should anything happen to my dearest George, I would wish to go to
Heaven that moment.''

 (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who loves me in Heaven? I am quite alone, child--that is why I had
rather stay here,''  (<font color='red'><b>Baroness/Baroness Bernstein/Bernstein</b></font>)</div>says the Baroness, in a frightened and rather piteous
tone. <div class="bookquote">``You are kind to me, God bless your sweet face! Though I scold,
and have a frightful temper, my servants will do anything to make me
comfortable, and get up at any hour of the night, and never say a cross
word in answer. I like my cards still. Indeed, life would be a blank
without `em. Almost everything is gone except that. I can't eat my
dinner now, since I lost those last two teeth. Everything goes away from
us in old age. But I still have my cards--thank Heaven, I still have my
cards!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And here she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) would begin to doze: waking up, however, if my wife
stirred or rose, and imagining that Theo was about to leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Don't
go away, I can't bear to be alone. I don't want you to talk. But I like
to see your face, my dear! It is much pleasanter than that horrid old
Brett's, that I have had scowling about my bedroom these ever so long
years.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, Baroness! still at your cribbage?''  (<font color='red'><b>a Countess</b></font>)</div>-LRB-We may fancy a noble Countess
interrupting a game at cards between Theo and Aunt Bernstein.-RRB- <div class="bookquote">``Me and
my Lord Esmond have come to see you! Go and shake hands with grandaunt,
Esmond! and tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) ladyship that your lordship's a good boy!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My lordship's a good boy,''  (<font color='red'><b>the child</b></font>)</div>says the child. -LRB-Madam Theo used to act
these scenes for me in a very lively way.-RRB-

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And if he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) is, I guess he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) don't take after his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) father,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady</b></font>)</div>shrieks out Lady
Castlewood. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) chose to fancy that Aunt Bernstein was deaf, and always
bawled at the old lady.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your ladyship chose my nephew for better or for worse,''  (<font color='red'><b>Aunt Bernstein</b></font>)</div>says Aunt
Bernstein, who was now always very much flurried in the presence of the
young Countess.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) is a precious deal worse than ever I thought he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was. I am
speaking of your Pa, Ezzy. If it wasn't for your mother, my son, Lord
knows what would become of you! We are a-going to see his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) little Royal
Highness. Sorry to see your ladyship not looking quite so well to-day.
We can't always remain young and law! how we do change as we grow old!
Go up and kiss that lady, Ezzy. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) has got a little boy, too. Why,
bless us! have you got the child downstairs?''  (<font color='red'><b>Master</b></font>)</div>Indeed, Master Miles was
down below, for special reasons accompanying his (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) mother on her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) visits to
Aunt Bernstein sometimes; and our aunt desired the mother's company so
much, that she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) was actually fain to put up with the child. <div class="bookquote">``So you have
got the child here? Oh, you slyboots!''  (<font color='red'><b>the Countess</b></font>)</div>says the Countess. <div class="bookquote">``Guess
you come after the old lady's money! Law bless you! Don't look so
frightened. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) can't hear a single word I say. Come, Ezzy. Good-bye,
aunt!''  (<font color='red'><b>lady</b></font>)</div>And my lady Countess rustles out of the room.

<p/>Did Aunt Bernstein hear her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) or not? Where was the wit for which the old
lady had been long famous? and was that fire put out, as well as the
brilliancy of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) eyes? With other people--she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was still ready enough,
and unsparing of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) sarcasms. When the Dowager of Castlewood and Lady
Fanny visited her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) -LRB-these exalted ladies treated my wife with perfect
indifference and charming good breeding-RRB-,--the Baroness, in their
society, was stately, easy, and even commanding. She (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) would mischievously
caress Mrs. Warrington before them; in her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) absence, vaunt my wife's good
breeding; say that her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) nephew had made a foolish match, perhaps, but
that I certainly had taken a charming wife. <div class="bookquote">``In a word, I praise you so
to them, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>says she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``that I think they would like to tear your
eyes out.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>But, before the little American, `tis certain that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was
uneasy and trembled. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was so afraid, that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) actually did not dare
to deny her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) door; and, the Countess's back turned, did not even abuse
her (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>). However much they might dislike her (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>), my ladies did not tear out
Theo's eyes. Once--they drove to our cottage at Lambeth, where my wife
happened to be sitting at the open window, holding her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) child on her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
knee, and in full view of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) visitors. A gigantic footman strutted
through our little garden, and delivered their ladyships' visiting
tickets at our door. Their hatred hurt us no more than their visit
pleased us. When next we had the loan of our friend the Brewer's
carriage Mrs. Warrington drove to Kensington, and Gumbo handed over to
the giant our cards in return for those which his (<font color='blue'><b>Brewer</b></font>) noble mistresses had
bestowed on us.

<p/>The Baroness had a coach, but seldom thought of giving it to us: and
would let Theo and her (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) maid and baby start from Clarges Street in the
rain, with a faint excuse that she (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) was afraid to ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) coachman
to take his (<font color='blue'><b>Brewer</b></font>) horses out. But, twice on her (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) return home, my wife was
frightened by rude fellows on the other side of Westminster Bridge; and
I fairly told my aunt that I should forbid Mrs. Warrington to go to her (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>),
unless she (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) could be brought home in safety; so grumbling Jehu had to
drive his (<font color='blue'><b>Brewer</b></font>) horses through the darkness. He (<font color='blue'><b>Brewer</b></font>) grumbled at my shillings: he (<font color='blue'><b>Brewer</b></font>)
did not know how few I had. Our poverty wore a pretty decent face. My
relatives never thought of relieving it, nor I of complaining before
them. I don't know how Sampson got a windfall of guineas; but, I
remember, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) brought me six once; and they were more welcome than any
money I ever had in my life. He (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) had been looking into Mr. Miles's crib,
as the child lay asleep; and, when the parson went away, I found the
money in the baby's little rosy hand. Yes, Love is best of all. I
have many such benefactions registered in my heart--precious welcome
fountains springing up in desert places, kind, friendly lights cheering
our despondency and gloom.

<p/>This worthy divine was willing enough to give as much of his (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) company as
she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) chose to Madame de Bernstein, whether for cards or theology. Having
known her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) ladyship for many years now, Sampson could see, and averred
to us, that she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) was breaking fast; and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) spoke of her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) evidently
increasing infirmities, and of the probability of their fatal
termination, Mr. S. would discourse to us in a very feeling manner of
the necessity for preparing for a future world; of the vanities of
this, and of the hope that in another there might be happiness for all
repentant sinners.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have been a sinner for one,''  (<font color='red'><b>the chaplain</b></font>)</div>says the chaplain, bowing his (<font color='blue'><b>chaplain</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``God
knoweth, and I pray Him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) to pardon me. I fear, sir, your aunt, the Lady
Baroness, is not in such a state of mind as will fit her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) very well
for the change which is imminent. I am but a poor weak wretch, and no
prisoner in Newgate could confess that more humbly and heartily. Once or
twice of late, I have sought to speak on this matter with her (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) ladyship,
but she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>) has received me very roughly. `Parson,' says she (<font color='blue'><b>Baroness</b></font>), `if you come
for cards, `tis mighty well, but I will thank you to spare me your
sermons.' What can I do, sir? I have called more than once of late, and
Mr. Case hath told me his (<font color='blue'><b>Case</b></font>) lady was unable to see me.''  (<font color='red'><b>Bernstein/Madame de Bernstein/Madame Bernstein</b></font>)</div>In fact Madame
Bernstein told my wife, whom she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) never refused, as I said, that the poor
chaplain's ton was unendurable, and as for his (<font color='blue'><b>chaplain</b></font>) theology, <div class="bookquote">``Haven't I been
a Bishop's wife?''  (<font color='red'><b>the chaplain</b></font>)</div>says she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``and do I want this creature to teach me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>The old lady was as impatient of doctors as of divines; pretending that
my wife was ailing, and that it was more convenient for our good Doctor
Heberden to visit her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) in Clarges Street than to travel all the way to
our Lambeth lodgings, we got Dr. H. to see Theo at our aunt's house, and
prayed him (<font color='blue'><b>H.</b></font>) if possible to offer his (<font color='blue'><b>H.</b></font>) advice to the Baroness: we made Mrs.
Brett, her (<font color='blue'><b>Brett</b></font>) woman, describe her (<font color='blue'><b>Brett</b></font>) ailments, and the doctor confirmed our
opinion that they were most serious, and might speedily end. She (<font color='blue'><b>Brett</b></font>) would
rally briskly enough of some evenings, and entertain a little company;
but of late she (<font color='blue'><b>Brett</b></font>) scarcely went abroad at all. A somnolence, which we had
remarked in her (<font color='blue'><b>Brett</b></font>), was attributable in part to opiates which she (<font color='blue'><b>Brett</b></font>) was in
the habit of taking; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Brett</b></font>) used these narcotics to smother habitual
pain. One night, as we two sat with her (<font color='blue'><b>Brett</b></font>) -LRB-Mr. Miles was weaned by this
time, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) mother could leave him (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) to the charge of our faithful
Molly-RRB-, she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) fell asleep over her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) cards. We hushed the servants who came
to lay out the supper-table -LRB-she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) would always have this luxurious, nor
could any injunction of ours or the Doctor's teach her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) abstinence-RRB-, and
we sat a while as we had often done before, waiting in silence till she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
should arouse from her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) doze.

<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) awoke, she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) looked fixedly at me for a while, fumbled with the
cards, and dropt them again in her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) lap, and said, <div class="bookquote">``Henry, have I been
long asleep?''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>I thought at first that it was for my brother she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) mistook
me; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) went on quickly, and with eyes fixed as upon some very far
distant object, and said, <div class="bookquote">``My dear, `tis of no use, I am not good enough
for you. I love cards, and play, and court; and oh, Harry, you don't
know all!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Here her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) voice changed, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) flung her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) head up. <div class="bookquote">``His (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
father married Anne Hyde, and sure the Esmond blood is as good as any
that's not royal. Mamma, you must please to treat me with more respect.
Vos sermons me fatiguent; entendez-vous?--faites place a mon Altesse
royale: mesdames, me connaissez-vous? je suis la--''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Here she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) broke out
into frightful hysterical shrieks and laughter, and as we ran up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>),
alarmed, <div class="bookquote">``Oui, Henri,''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) says, <div class="bookquote">``il a jure de m'epouser et les princes
tiennent parole--n’est-ce pas? O oui! ils tiennent parole; si non, tu le
tueras, cousin; tu le--ah! que je suis folle!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And the pitiful shrieks
and laughter recommenced. Ere her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) frightened people had come up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>)
summons, the poor thing had passed out of this mood into another; but
always labouring under the same delusion--that I was the Henry of past
times, who had loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) and had been forsaken by her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>), whose bones were
lying far away by the banks of the Potomac.

<p/>My wife and the women put the poor lady to bed as I ran myself for
medical aid. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) rambled, still talking wildly, through the night, with
her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) nurses and the surgeon sitting by her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>). Then she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) fell into a sleep,
brought on by more opiate. When she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) awoke, her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) mind did not actually
wander; but her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) speech was changed, and one arm and side were paralysed.

<p/>`Tis needless to relate the progress and termination of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) malady, or
watch that expiring flame of life as it gasps and flickers. Her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) senses
would remain with her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) for a while -LRB-and then she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was never satisfied
unless Theo was by her (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) bedside-RRB-, or again her (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) mind would wander, and the
poor decrepit creature, lying upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) bed, would imagine herself young
again, and speak incoherently of the scenes and incidents of her (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) early
days. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) would address me as Henry again, and call upon me to
revenge some insult or slight, of which -LRB-whatever my suspicions might
be-RRB- the only record lay in her (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) insane memory. <div class="bookquote">``They have always been
so,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) would murmur: <div class="bookquote">``they never loved man or woman but they forsook
them. Je me vengerai, O oui, je me vengerai! I know them all: I know
them all: and I will go to my Lord Stair with the list. Don't tell
me! His (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) religion can't be the right one. I will go back to my mother's
though she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) does not love me. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) never did. Why don't you, mother? Is
it because I am too wicked? Ah! Pitie, pitie. O mon pere! I will make
my confession'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--and here the unhappy paralysed lady made as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) would
move in her (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) bed.

<p/>Let us draw the curtain round it. I think with awe still, of those rapid
words, uttered in the shadow of the canopy, as my pallid wife sits by
her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) Prayer-book on her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) knee; as the attendants move to and fro
noiselessly; as the clock ticks without, and strikes the fleeting hours;
as the sun falls upon the Kneller picture of Beatrix in her (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrix</b></font>) beauty, with
the blushing cheeks, the smiling lips, the waving auburn tresses, and
the eyes which seem to look towards the dim figure moaning in the bed.
I could not for a while understand why our aunt's attendants were so
anxious that we should quit it. But towards evening, a servant stole
in, and whispered her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) woman; and then Brett, looking rather disturbed,
begged us to go downstairs, as the--as the Doctor was come to visit the
Baroness. I did not tell my wife, at the time, who <div class="bookquote">``the Doctor''  (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div>was; but
as the gentleman slid by us, and passed upstairs, I saw at once that he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
was a Catholic ecclesiastic. When Theo next saw our poor lady, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
was speechless; she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) never recognised any one about her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), and so passed
unconsciously out of life. During her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) illness her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) relatives had called
assiduously enough, though she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) would see none of them save us. But when
she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was gone, and we descended to the lower rooms after all was over, we
found Castlewood with his (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) white face, and my lady from Kensington, and
Mr. Will already assembled in the parlour. They looked greedily at us as
we appeared. They were hungry for the prey.

<p/>When our aunt's will was opened, we found it dated five years back, and
everything she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) had was left to her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) dear nephew, Henry Esmond Warrington,
of Castlewood, in Virginia, <div class="bookquote">``in affectionate love and remembrance of the
name which he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) bore.''  (<font color='red'><b>Henry/Henry Esmond/Mr. Henry Warrington</b></font>)</div>The property was not great. Her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) revenue had been
derived from pensions from the Crown as it appeared -LRB-for what services
I cannot say-RRB-, but the pension of course died with her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>), and there were
only a few hundred pounds, besides jewels, trinkets, and the furniture
of the house in Clarges Street, of which all London came to the sale.
Mr. Walpole bid for her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) portrait, but I made free with Harry's money so
far as to buy the picture in: and it now hangs over the mantelpiece of
the chamber in which I write. What with jewels, laces, trinkets, and old
china which she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) had gathered--Harry became possessed of more than four
thousand pounds by his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) aunt's legacy. I made so free as to lay my hand
upon a hundred, which came, just as my stock was reduced to twenty
pounds; and I procured bills for the remainder, which I forwarded to
Captain Henry Esmond in Virginia. Nor should I have scrupled to take
more -LRB-for my brother was indebted to me in a much greater sum-RRB-, but he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)
wrote me there was another wonderful opportunity for buying an estate
and negroes in our neighbourhood at home; and Theo and I were only
too glad to forgo our little claim, so as to establish our brother's
fortune. As to mine, poor Harry at this time did not know the state of
it. My mother had never informed him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had ceased remitting to
me. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) helped him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) with a considerable sum, the result of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) savings,
for the purchase of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) new estate; and Theo and I were most heartily
thankful at his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) prosperity.

<p/>And how strange ours was! By what curious good fortune, as our purse
was emptied, was it filled again! I had actually come to the end of our
stock, when poor Sampson brought me his (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) six pieces--and with these I was
enabled to carry on, until my half-year's salary, as young Mr. Foker's
Governor, was due: then Harry's hundred, on which I laid main basse,
helped us over three months -LRB-we were behindhand with our rent, or the
money would have lasted six good weeks longer-RRB-: and when this was pretty
near expended, what should arrive but a bill of exchange for a couple of
hundred pounds from Jamaica, with ten thousand blessings, from the dear
friends there, and fond scolding from the General that we had not
sooner told him (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) of our necessity--of which he (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) had only heard through our
friend, Mr. Foker, who spoke in such terms of Theo and myself as to make
our parents more than ever proud of their children. Was my quarrel with
my mother irreparable? Let me go to Jamaica. There was plenty there for
all, and employment which his (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) Excellency as Governor would immediately
procure for me. <div class="bookquote">``Come to us!''  (<font color='red'><b>Hetty/Miss Hetty/Lambert</b></font>)</div>writes Hetty. <div class="bookquote">``Come to us!''  (<font color='red'><b>Aunt</b></font>)</div>writes Aunt
Lambert. <div class="bookquote">``Have my children been suffering poverty, and we rolling in

 (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div><p/>Our young benefactor was never to hear of our family's love and
gratitude to him (<font color='blue'><b>benefactor</b></font>). That glimpse of his (<font color='blue'><b>benefactor</b></font>) bright face over the railings
before our house at Lambeth, as he (<font color='blue'><b>benefactor</b></font>) rode away on his (<font color='blue'><b>benefactor</b></font>) little horse, was
the last we ever were to have of him (<font color='blue'><b>benefactor</b></font>). At Christmas a basket comes to us,
containing a great turkey, and three brace of partridges, with a
card, and <div class="bookquote">``shot by M. W.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>wrote on one of them. And on receipt of this
present, we wrote to thank the child and gave him (<font color='blue'><b>benefactor</b></font>) our sister's message.

<p/>To this letter, there came a reply from Lady Warrington, who said she (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>)
was bound to inform me, that in visiting me her (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) child had been guilty
of disobedience, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) learned his (<font color='blue'><b>benefactor</b></font>) visit to me now for the
first time. Knowing my views regarding duty to my parents -LRB-which I had
exemplified in my marriage-RRB-, she (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) could not wish her (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) son to adopt them.
And fervently hoping that I might be brought to see the errors of
my present course, she (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) took leave of this most unpleasant subject,
subscribing herself, etc. etc.. And we got this pretty missive as sauce
for poor Miles's turkey, which was our family feast for New Year's Day.
My Lady Warrington's letter choked our meal, though Sampson and Charley
rejoiced over it.

<p/>Ah me! Ere the month was over, our little friend was gone from amongst
us. Going out shooting, and dragging his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) gun through a hedge after him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>),
the trigger caught in a bush, and the poor little man was brought home
to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) father's house, only to live a few days and expire in pain and
torture. Under the yew-trees yonder, I can see the vault which covers
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and where my bones one day no doubt will be laid. And over our pew
at church, my children have often wistfully spelt the touching epitaph
in which Miles's heartbroken father has inscribed his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) grief and love for
his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) only son.




<p/>CHAPTER LXXXIV. In which Harry submits to the Common Lot


<p/>Hard times were now over with me, and I had to battle with poverty no
more. My little kinsman's death made a vast difference in my worldly
prospects. I became next heir to a good estate. My uncle and his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>)
wife were not likely to have more children. <div class="bookquote">``The woman is capable of
committing any crime to disappoint you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sampson/Mr. Sampson</b></font>)</div>Sampson vowed; but, in truth,
my Lady Warrington was guilty of no such treachery. Cruelly smitten
by the stroke which fell upon them, Lady Warrington was taught by her (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>)
religious advisers to consider it as a chastisement of Heaven, and
submit to the Divine Will. <div class="bookquote">``Whilst your son lived, your heart was turned
away from the better world''  (<font color='red'><b>clergyman</b></font>)</div>-LRB-her (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) clergyman told her (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>)-RRB-, <div class="bookquote">``and your ladyship
thought too much of this. For your son's advantage you desired rank and
title. You asked and might have obtained an earthly coronet. Of what
avail is it now, to one who has but a few years to pass upon earth--of
what importance compared to the heavenly crown, for which you are an
assured candidate?''  (<font color='red'><b>clergyman</b></font>)</div>The accident caused no little sensation. In the
chapels of that enthusiastic sect, towards which, after her (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) son's death,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) now more than ever inclined, many sermons were preached bearing
reference to the event. Far be it from me to question the course which
the bereaved mother pursued, or to regard with other than respect and
sympathy any unhappy soul seeking that refuge whither sin and grief
and disappointment fly for consolation. Lady Warrington even tried a
reconciliation with myself. A year after her (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) loss, being in London, she (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>)
signified that she (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) would see me, and I waited on her (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>); and she (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) gave me,
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) usual didactic way, a homily upon my position and her (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) own.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) marvelled at the decree of Heaven, which had permitted, and
how dreadfully punished! her (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) poor child's disobedience to her (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>)--a
disobedience by which I was to profit. -LRB-It appeared my poor little man
had disobeyed orders, and gone out with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) gun, unknown to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mother.-RRB-
She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) hoped that, should I ever succeed to the property, though the
Warringtons were, thank Heaven, a long-lived family, except in my own
father's case, whose life had been curtailed by the excesses of a very
ill-regulated youth,--but should I ever succeed to the family estate and
honours, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) hoped, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) prayed, that my present course of life might be
altered; that I should part from my unworthy associates; that I should
discontinue all connexion with the horrid theatre and its licentious
frequenters; that I should turn to that quarter where only peace was
to be had; and to those sacred duties which she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) feared--she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) very much
feared that I had neglected. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) filled her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) exhortation with Scripture
language, which I do not care to imitate. When I took my leave she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) gave
me a packet of sermons for Mrs. Warrington, and a little book of hymns
by Miss Dora, who has been eminent in that society of which she (<font color='blue'><b>Dora</b></font>) and
her (<font color='blue'><b>Dora</b></font>) mother became avowed professors subsequently, and who, after the
dowager's death, at Bath, three years since, married young Mr. Juffles,
a celebrated preacher. The poor lady forgave me then, but she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) could not
bear the sight of our boy. We lost our second child, and then my aunt
and her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) daughter came eagerly enough to the poor suffering mother, and
even invited us hither. But my uncle was now almost every day in our
house. He (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) would sit for hours looking at our boy. He (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) brought him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) endless
toys and sweetmeats. He (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) begged that the child might call him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) Godpapa.
When we felt our own grief -LRB-which at times still, and after the lapse of
five-and-twenty years, strikes me as keenly as on the day when we
first lost our little one-RRB---when I felt my own grief, I knew how to
commiserate his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>). But my wife could pity him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) before she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) knew what it
was to lose a child of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) own. The mother's anxious heart had already
divined the pang which was felt by the sorrow-stricken father;
mine, more selfish, has only learned pity from experience, and I was
reconciled to my uncle by my little baby's coffin.

<p/>The poor man sent his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) coach to follow the humble funeral, and afterwards
took out little Miles, who prattled to him (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) unceasingly, and forgot any
grief he (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) might have felt in the delights of his (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) new black clothes, and
the pleasures of the airing. How the innocent talk of the child stabbed
the mother's heart! Would we ever wish that it should heal of that
wound? I know her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) face so well that, to this day, I can tell when,
sometimes, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) is thinking of the loss of that little one. It is not a
grief for a parting so long ago; it is a communion with a soul we love
in Heaven.

<p/>We came back to our bright lodgings in Bloomsbury soon afterwards,
and my young bear, whom I could no longer lead, and who had taken a
prodigious friendship for Charley, went to the Chartreux School, where
his (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) friend took care that he (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) had no more beating than was good for him (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>),
and where -LRB-in consequence of the excellence of his (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) private tutor, no
doubt-RRB- he (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) took and kept a good place. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) liked the school so much,
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) says, if ever he (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) has a son, he (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) shall be sent to that seminary.

<p/>Now, I could no longer lead my bear, for this reason, that I had other
business to follow. Being fully reconciled to us, I do believe, for
Mr. Miles's sake, my uncle -LRB-who was such an obsequious supporter of
Government, that I wonder the Minister ever gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Minister</b></font>) anything, being
perfectly sure of his (<font color='blue'><b>Minister</b></font>) vote-RRB- used his (<font color='blue'><b>Minister</b></font>) influence in behalf of his (<font color='blue'><b>Minister</b></font>) nephew
and heir; and I had the honour to be gazetted as one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Minister</b></font>) Majesty's
Commissioners for licensing hackney-coaches, a post I filled, I trust,
with credit, until a quarrel with the Minister -LRB-to be mentioned in its
proper place-RRB- deprived me of that one. I took my degree also at the
Temple, and appeared in Westminster Hall in my gown and wig. And, this
year, my good friend, Mr. Foker, having business at Paris, I had the
pleasure of accompanying him (<font color='blue'><b>Foker</b></font>) thither, where I was received a bras
ouverts by my dear American preserver, Monsieur de Florac, who
introduced me to his (<font color='blue'><b>Foker</b></font>) noble family, and to even more of the polite
society of the capital than I had leisure to frequent; for I had too
much spirit to desert my kind patron Foker, whose acquaintance lay
chiefly amongst the bourgeoisie, especially with Monsieur Santerre, a
great brewer of Paris, a scoundrel who hath since distinguished himself
in blood and not beer. Mr. F. had need of my services as interpreter,
and I was too glad that he (<font color='blue'><b>F.</b></font>) should command them, and to be able to pay
back some of the kindness which he (<font color='blue'><b>F.</b></font>) had rendered to me. Our ladies,
meanwhile, were residing at Mr. Foker's new villa at Wimbledon, and were
pleased to say that they were amused with the <div class="bookquote">``Parisian letters''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Foker/Foker</b></font>)</div>which
I sent to them, through my distinguished friend Mr. Hume, then of the
Embassy, and which subsequently have been published in a neat volume.

<p/>Whilst I was tranquilly discharging my small official duties in London,
those troubles were commencing which were to end in the great separation
between our colonies and the mother country. When Mr. Grenville proposed
his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) stamp-duties, I said to my wife that the bill would create a mighty
discontent at home, for we were ever anxious to get as much as we could
from England, and pay back as little; but assuredly I never anticipated
the prodigious anger which the scheme created. It was with us as with
families or individuals. A pretext is given for a quarrel: the real
cause lies in long bickerings and previous animosities. Many foolish
exactions and petty tyrannies, the habitual insolence of Englishmen
towards all foreigners, all colonists, all folk who dare to think their
rivers as good as our Abana and Pharpar, the natural spirit of men
outraged by our imperious domineering spirit, set Britain and her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)
colonies to quarrel; and the astonishing blunders of the system adopted
in England brought the quarrel to an issue, which I, for one, am not
going to deplore. Had I been in Virginia instead of London, `tis
very possible I should have taken the provincial side, if out of mere
opposition to that resolute mistress of Castlewood, who might have
driven me into revolt, as England did the colonies. Was the Stamp Act
the cause of the revolution?--a tax no greater than that cheerfully
paid in England. Ten years earlier, when the French were within our
territory, and we were imploring succour from home, would the colonies
have rebelled at the payment of this tax? Do not most people consider
the tax-gatherer the natural enemy? Against the British in America there
were arrayed thousands and thousands of the high-spirited and brave, but
there were thousands more who found their profit in the quarrel, or had
their private reasons for engaging in it. I protest I don't know now
whether mine were selfish or patriotic, or which side was in the right,
or whether both were not. I am sure we in England had nothing to do but
to fight the battle out; and, having lost the game, I do vow and believe
that, after the first natural soreness, the loser felt no rancour.

<p/>What made brother Hal write home from Virginia, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>) seemed
exceedingly loth to quit, such flaming patriotic letters? My kind, best
brother was always led by somebody; by me when we were together -LRB-he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) had
such an idea of my wit and wisdom, that if I said the day was fine, he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)
would ponder over the observation as though it was one of the sayings of
the Seven Sages-RRB-, by some other wiseacre when I was away. Who inspired
these flaming letters, this boisterous patriotism, which he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) sent to us
in London? <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>candidate</b></font>) is rebelling against Madam Esmond,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>candidate</b></font>) is led by
some colonial person--by that lady, perhaps,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>hinted my wife. Who <div class="bookquote">``that
lady''  (<font color='red'><b>Hal</b></font>)</div>was Hal never had told us; and, indeed, besought me never to
allude to the delicate subject in my letters to him (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``for Madam wishes
to see `em all, and I wish to say nothing about you know what until the
proper moment,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>) wrote. No affection could be greater than that
which his (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>) letters showed. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>) heard -LRB-from the informant whom I have
mentioned-RRB- that in the midst of my own extreme straits I had retained
no more than a hundred pounds out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>) aunt's legacy, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>) was for
mortgaging the estate which he (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>) had just bought; and had more than one
quarrel with his (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>) mother in my behalf, and spoke his (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>) mind with a great
deal more frankness than I should ever have ventured to show. Until
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) angry recriminations -LRB-when she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) charged him (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>) with ingratitude, after
having toiled and saved so much and so long for him (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>)-RRB-, the poor fellow
did not know that our mother had cut off my supplies to advance his (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>)
interests; and by the time this news came to him (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>) bargains were made,
and I was fortunately quite out of want.

<p/>Every scrap of paper which we ever wrote, our thrifty parent at
Castlewood taped and docketed and put away. We boys were more careless
about our letters to one another: I especially, who perhaps chose rather
to look down upon my younger brother's literary performances; but my
wife is not so supercilious, and hath kept no small number of Harry's
letters, as well as those of the angelic being whom we were presently to
call sister.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``To think whom he (<font color='blue'><b>candidate</b></font>) has chosen, and whom he (<font color='blue'><b>candidate</b></font>) might have had! Oh, `tis
cruel!''  (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div>cries my wife, when we got that notable letter in which Harry
first made us acquainted with the name of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) charmer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was a very pretty little maid when I left home, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) may be a
perfect beauty now,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I remarked, as I read over the longest letter Harry
ever wrote on private affairs.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But is she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) to compare to my Hetty?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Warrington/Mrs. Esmond/Mrs. Esmond Warrington</b></font>)</div>says Mrs. Warrington.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We agreed that Hetty and Harry were not to be happy together, my love,''
 (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>say I.

<p/>Theo gives her (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) husband a kiss. <div class="bookquote">``My dear, I wish they had tried,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>)
says with a sigh. <div class="bookquote">``I was afraid lest--lest Hetty should have led him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>),
you see; and I think she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) hath the better head. But, from reading this,
it appears that the new lady has taken command of poor Harry,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and she (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>)
hands me the letter:--


<p/>``My dearest George hath been prepared by previous letters to understand
how a certain lady has made a conquest of my heart, which I have given
away in exchange for something infinitely more valuable, namely, her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
own. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) is at my side as I write this letter, and if there is no bad
spelling, such as you often used to laugh at, `tis because I have my
pretty dictionary at hand, which makes no faults in the longest word,
nor in anything else I know of: being of opinion that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) is perfection.

<p/>``As Madam Esmond saw all your letters, I writ you not to give any hint
of a certain delicate matter--but now `tis no secret, and is known to
all the country. Mr. George is not the only one of our family who has
made a secret marriage, and been scolded by his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) mother. As a dutiful
younger brother I have followed his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) example; and now I may tell you how
this mighty event came about.

<p/>``I had not been at home long before I saw my fate was accomplisht. I
will not tell you how beautiful Miss Fanny Mountain had grown since I
had been away in Europe. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) saith, `You never will think so,' and I
am glad, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) is the only thing in life I would grudge to my dearest
brother.

<p/>``That neither Madam Esmond nor my other mother -LRB-as Mountain is now-RRB-
should have seen our mutual attachment, is a wonder--only to be
accounted for by supposing that love makes other folks blind. Mine for
my Fanny was increased by seeing what the treatment was she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had from
Madam Esmond, who indeed was very rough and haughty with her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>), which my
love bore with a sweetness perfectly angelic -LRB-this I will say, though
she (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) will order me not to write any such nonsense-RRB-. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) was scarce better
treated than a servant of the house--indeed our negroes can talk much
more free before Madam Esmond than ever my Fanny could.

<p/>``And yet my Fanny says she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) doth not regret Madam's unkindness, as
without it I possibly never should have been what I am to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>). Oh, dear
brother! when I remember how great your goodness hath been, how, in my
own want, you paid my debts, and rescued me out of prison; how you have
been living in poverty which never need have occurred but for my fault;
how you might have paid yourself back my just debt to you and would not,
preferring my advantage to your own comfort, indeed I am lost at the
thought of such goodness; and ought I not to be thankful to Heaven that
hath given me such a wife and such a brother?

<p/>``When I writ to you requesting you to send me my aunt's legacy money,
for which indeed I had the most profitable and urgent occasion, I had no
idea that you were yourself suffering poverty. That you, the head of our
family, should condescend to be governor to a brewer's son!--that you
should have to write for booksellers -LRB-except in so far as your own
genius might prompt you-RRB-, never once entered my mind, until Mr. Foker's
letter came to us, and this would never have been shown--for Madam kept
it secret--had it not been for the difference which sprang up between
us.

<p/>``Poor Tom Diggle's estate and negroes being for sale, owing to
Tom's losses and extravagance at play, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) father's debts before
him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)--Madam Esmond saw here was a great opportunity of making a provision
for me, and that with six thousand pounds for the farm and stock, I
should be put in possession of as pretty a property as falls to most
younger sons in this country. It lies handy enough to Richmond, between
Kent and Hanover Court House--the mansion nothing for elegance
compared to ours at Castlewood, but the land excellent and the people
extraordinary healthy.

<p/>``Here was a second opportunity, Madam Esmond said, such as never might
again befall. By the sale of my commissions and her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) own savings I might
pay more than half of the price of the property, and get the rest of
the money on mortgage; though here, where money is scarce to procure,
it would have been difficult and dear. At this juncture, with our new
relative, Mr. Van den Bosch, bidding against us -LRB-his (<font color='blue'><b>Bosch</b></font>) agent is wild that
we should have bought the property over him (<font color='blue'><b>Bosch</b></font>)-RRB-, my aunt's legacy most
opportunely fell in. And now I am owner of a good house and negroes in
my native country, shall be called, no doubt, to our House of Burgesses,
and hope to see my dearest brother and family under my own roof-tree.
To sit at my own fireside, to ride my own horses to my own hounds,
is better than going a-soldiering, now war is over, and there are no
French. to fight. Indeed, Madam Esmond made a condition that I should
leave the army, and live at home, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) brought me her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) 1750 pounds of
savings. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) had lost one son, she (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) said, who chose to write play-books,
and live in England--let the other stay with her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) at home.

<p/>``But, after the purchase of the estate was made, and my papers for
selling out were sent home, my mother would have had me marry a person
of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) choosing, but by no means of mine. You remember Miss Betsy Pitts
at Williamsburgh? She (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>) is in no wise improved by having had her (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>) face
dreadfully scarred with small-pock, and though Madam Esmond saith the
young lady hath every virtue, I own her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) virtues did not suit me. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>)
eyes do not look straight; she (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) hath one leg shorter than another; and
oh, brother! didst thou never remark Fanny's ankles when we were boys?
Neater I never saw at the Opera.

<p/>``Now, when `twas agreed that I should leave the army, a certain dear
girl -LRB-canst thou guess her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) name?-RRB- one day, when we were private, burst
into tears of such happiness, that I could not but feel immensely
touched by her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) sympathy.

<p/>```Ah!' says she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), `do you think, sir, that the idea of the son of my
revered benefactress going to battle doth not inspire me with terror?
Ah, Mr. Henry! do you imagine I have no heart? When Mr. George was with
Braddock, do you fancy we did not pray for him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)? And when you were with
Mr. Wolfe--oh!'

<p/>``Here the dear creature hid her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) eyes in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) handkerchief, and had hard
work to prevent her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) mama, who came in, from seeing that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was crying.
But my dear Mountain declares that, though she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) might have fancied, might
have prayed in secret for such a thing -LRB-she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) owns to that now-RRB-, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
never imagined it for one moment. Nor, indeed, did my good mother, who
supposed that Sam Lintot, the apothecary's lad at Richmond, was Fanny's
flame--an absurd fellow that I near kicked into James River.

<p/>``But when the commission was sold, and the estate bought, what does
Fanny do but fall into a deep melancholy? I found her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) crying one day, in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) mother's room, where the two ladies had been at work trimming hats
for my negroes.

<p/>```What! crying, miss?' says I. `Has my mother been scolding you?'

<p/>```No,' says the dear creature. `Madam Esmond has been kind to-day.'

<p/>``And her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) tears drop down on a cockade which she (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) is sewing on to a hat
for Sady, who is to be head-groom.

<p/>```Then, why, miss, are those dear eyes so red?' say I.

<p/>```Because I have the toothache,' she (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) says, `or because--because I am a
fool.' Here she (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) fairly bursts out. `Oh, Mr. Harry! oh, Mr. Warrington!
You are going to leave us, and `tis as well. You will take your place
in your country, as becomes you. You will leave us poor women in our
solitude and dependence. You will come to visit us from time to time.
And when you are happy and honoured, and among your gay companions, you
will remember your--'

<p/>``Here she (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) could say no more, and hid her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) face with one hand as I, I
confess, seized the other.

<p/>```Dearest, sweetest Miss Mountain!' says I. `Oh, could I think that the
parting from me has brought tears to those lovely eyes! Indeed, I fear,
I should be almost happy! Let them look upon your--'

<p/>```Oh, sir!' cries my charmer. `Oh, Mr. Warrington! consider who I am,
sir, and who you are! Remember the difference between us! Release my
hand, sir! What would Madam Esmond say if--if--'

<p/>``If what, I don't know, for here our mother was in the room.

<p/>```What would Madam Esmond say?' she (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) cries out. `She (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) would say that you
are an ungrateful, artful, false, little--'

<p/>```Madam!' says I.

<p/>```Yes, an ungrateful, artful, false, little wretch!' cries out my
mother. `For shame, miss! What would Mr. Lintot say if he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) saw you making
eyes at the Captain? And for you, Harry, I will have you bring none of
your garrison manners hither. This is a Christian family, sir, and you
will please to know that my house is not intended for captains and their
misses!'

<p/>```Misses, mother!' says I. `Gracious powers, do you ever venture for
to call Miss Mountain by such a name? Miss Mountain, the purest of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
sex!'

<p/>```The purest of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) sex! Can I trust my own ears?' asks Madam, turning
very pale.

<p/>```I mean that if a man would question her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) honour, I would fling him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) out
of window,' says I.

<p/>```You mean that you--your mother's son--are actually paying honourable
attention to this young person?'

<p/>```He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) would never dare to offer any other,' cries my Fanny; `nor any
woman but you, madam, to think so!'

<p/>```Oh, I didn't know, miss!' says mother, dropping her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) a fine curtsey, `I
didn't know the honour you were doing our family! You propose to marry
with us, do you? Do I understand Captain Warrington aright, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>)
intends to offer me Miss Mountain as a daughter-in-law?'

<p/>```'Tis to be seen, madam, that I have no protector, or you would not
insult me so!' cries my poor victim.

<p/>```I should think the apothecary protection sufficient!' says our mother.

<p/>```I don't, mother!' I bawl out, for I was very angry; `and if Lintot
offers her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) any liberty, I'll brain him (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>) own pestle!'

<p/>```Oh! if Lintot has withdrawn, sir, I suppose I must be silent. But I
did not know of the circumstance. He (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>) came hither, as I supposed, to pay
court to Miss: and we all thought the match equal, and I encouraged it.'

<p/>```He (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>) came because I had the toothache!' cries my darling -LRB-and indeed she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
had a dreadful bad tooth. And he (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>) took it out for her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), and there is no
end to the suspicions and calumnies of women-RRB-.

<p/>```What more natural than that he (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>) should marry my housekeeper's
daughter--`twas a very suitable match!' continues Madam, taking snuff.
`But I confess,' she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) adds, going on, `I was not aware that you intended
to jilt the apothecary for my son!'

<p/>```Peace, for Heaven's sake, peace, Mr. Warrington!' cries my angel.

<p/>```Pray, sir, before you fully make up your mind, had you not better look
round the rest of my family?' says Madam. `Dinah is a fine tall girl,
and not very black; Cleopatra is promised to Ajax the blacksmith, to
be sure; but then we could break the marriage, you know. If with an
apothecary, why not with a blacksmith? Martha's husband has run away,
and--'

<p/>``Here, dear brother, I own I broke out a-swearing. I can't help it; but
at times, when a man is angry, it do relieve him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) immensely. I'm blest,
but I should have gone wild, if it hadn't been for them oaths.

<p/>```Curses, blasphemy, ingratitude, disobedience,' says mother, leaning
now on her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) tortoiseshell stick, and then waving it--something like a
queen in a play. `These are my rewards!' says she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). `O Heaven, what have
I done, that I should merit this awful punishment? and does it please
you to visit the sins of my fathers upon me? Where do my children
inherit their pride? When I was young, had I any? When my papa bade me
marry, did I refuse? Did I ever think of disobeying? No, sir. My fault
hath been, and I own it, that my love was centred upon you, perhaps to
the neglect of your elder brother.' -LRB-Indeed, brother, there was some
truth in what Madam said.-RRB- `I turned from Esau, and I clung to Jacob.
And now I have my reward, I have my reward! I fixed my vain thoughts on
this world, and its distinctions. To see my son advanced in worldly rank
was my ambition. I toiled, and spared, that I might bring him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) worldly
wealth. I took unjustly from my eldest son's portion, that my younger
might profit. And oh! that I should see him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) seducing the daughter of my
own housekeeper under my own roof, and replying to my just anger with
oaths and blasphemies!'

<p/>```I try to seduce no one, madam,' I cried out. `If I utter oaths and
blasphemies, I beg your pardon; but you are enough to provoke a saint to
speak `em. I won't have this young lady's character assailed--no, not by
own mother nor any mortal alive. No, dear Miss Mountain! If Madam Esmond
chooses to say that my designs on you are dishonourable,--let this
undeceive her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>)!' And, as I spoke, I went down on my knees, seizing my
adorable Fanny's hand. `And if you will accept this heart and hand,
miss,' says I, `they are yours for ever.'

<p/>```You, at least, I knew, sir,' says Fanny, with a noble curtsey, `never
said a word that was disrespectful to me, or entertained any doubt of my
honour. And I trust it is only Madam Esmond, in the world, who can have
such an opinion of me. After what your ladyship hath said of me, of
course I can stay no longer in your house.'

<p/>```Of course, madam, I never intended you should; and the sooner you
leave it the better,' cries our mother.

<p/>```If you are driven from my mother's house, mine, miss, is at your
service,' says I, making her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) a low bow. `It is nearly ready now. If you
will take it and stay in it for ever, it is yours! And as Madam Esmond
insulted your honour, at least let me do all in my power to make a
reparation!' I don't know what more I exactly said, for you may fancy I
was not a little flustered and excited by the scene. But here Mountain
came in, and my dearest Fanny, flinging herself into her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) mother's arms,
wept upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) shoulder; whilst Madam Esmond, sitting down in her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) chair,
looked at us as pale as a stone. Whilst I was telling my story to
Mountain -LRB-who, poor thing, had not the least idea, not she (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>), that Miss
Fanny and I had the slightest inclination for one another-RRB-, I could hear
our mother once or twice still saying, `I am punished for my crime!'

<p/>``Now, what our mother meant by her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) crime I did not know at first, or
indeed take much heed of what she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said; for you know her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) way, and
how, when she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) is angry, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) always talks sermons. But Mountain told me
afterwards, when we had some talk together, as we did at the tavern,
whither the ladies presently removed with their bag and baggage--for not
only would they not stay at Madam's house after the language she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) used,
but my mother determined to go away likewise. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) called her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) servants
together, and announced her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) intention of going home instantly to
Castlewood; and I own to you `twas with a horrible pain I saw the family
coach roll by, with six horses, and ever so many of the servants on
mules and on horseback, as I and Fanny looked through the blinds of the
Tavern.

<p/>``After the words Madam used to my spotless Fanny, `twas impossible that
the poor child or her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) mother should remain in our house: and indeed
M. said that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) would go back to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) relations in England: and a ship
bound homewards lying in James River, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) went and bargained with the
captain about a passage, so bent was she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) upon quitting the country, and
so little did she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) think of making a match between me and my angel. But
the cabin was mercifully engaged by a North Carolina gentleman and his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
family, and before the next ship sailed -LRB-which bears this letter to my
dearest George-RRB- they have agreed to stop with me. Almost all the ladies
in this neighbourhood have waited on them. When the marriage takes
place, I hope Madam Esmond will be reconciled. My Fanny's father was a
British officer; and sure, ours was no more. Some day, please Heaven,
we shall visit Europe, and the places where my wild oats were sown,
and where I committed so many extravagances from which my dear brother
rescued me.

<p/>``The ladies send you their affection and duty, and to my sister. We hear
his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) Excellency General Lambert is much beloved in Jamaica: and I shall
write to our dear friends there announcing my happiness. My dearest
brother will participate in it, and I am ever his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) grateful and
affectionate H. E. W.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``P.S.--Till Mountain told me, I had no more notion than the ded that
Madam E. had actially stopt your allowances; besides making you pay
for ever so much--near upon 1000 pounds Mountain says--for goods, etc.,
provided for the Virginian proparty. Then there was all the charges of
me out of prison, which I. O. U. with all my hart. Draw upon me, please,
dearest brother--to any amount--adressing me to care of Messrs. Horn and
Sandon, Williamsburg, privit; who remitt by present occasion a bill
for 225 pounds, payable by their London agents on demand. Please don't
acknolledge this in answering; as there's no good in bothering women
with accounts--and with the extra 5 pounds by a capp or what she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) likes
for my dear sister, and a toy for my nephew from Uncle Hal.''


 (<font color='red'><b>the ladies</b></font>)</div><p/>The conclusion to which we came on the perusal of this document was,
that the ladies had superintended the style and spelling of my poor
Hal's letter, but that the postscript was added without their knowledge.
And I am afraid we argued that the Virginian Squire was under female
domination--as Hercules, Samson, and fortes multi had been before him (<font color='blue'><b>Samson</b></font>).




<p/>CHAPTER LXXXV. Inveni Portum


<p/>When my mother heard of my acceptance of a place at home, I think she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
was scarcely well pleased. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) may have withdrawn her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) supplies, in order
to starve me into a surrender, and force me to return with my family to
Virginia, and to dependence under her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). We never, up to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) dying day,
had any explanation on the pecuniary dispute between us. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) cut off my
allowances: I uttered not a word; but managed to live without her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) aid.
I never heard that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) repented of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) injustice, or acknowledged it,
except from Harry's private communication to me. In after days, when we
met, by a great gentleness in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) behaviour, and an uncommon respect
and affection shown to my wife, Madam Esmond may have intended I should
understand her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) tacit admission that she (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) had been wrong; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) made no
apology, nor did I ask one. Harry being provided for -LRB-whose welfare I
could not grudge-RRB-, all my mother's savings and economical schemes went
to my advantage, who was her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) heir. Time was when a few guineas would
have been more useful to me than hundreds which might come to me when
I had no need; but when Madam Esmond and I met, the period of necessity
was long passed away; I had no need to scheme ignoble savings, or to
grudge the doctor his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) fee: I had plenty, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) could but bring me
more. No doubt she (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) suffered in her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) own mind to think that my children
had been hungry, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) had offered them no food; and that strangers
had relieved the necessity from which her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) proud heart had caused her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) to
turn aside. Proud? Was she (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) prouder than I? A soft word of explanation
between us might have brought about a reconciliation years before it
came but I would never speak, nor did she (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>). When I commit a wrong, and
know it subsequently, I love to ask pardon; but `tis as a satisfaction
to my own pride, and to myself I am apologising for having been wanting
to myself. And hence, I think -LRB-out of regard to that personage of ego-RRB-,
I scarce ever could degrade myself to do a meanness. How do men feel
whose whole lives -LRB-and many men's lives are-RRB- are lies, schemes, and
subterfuges? What sort of company do they keep when they are alone?
Daily in life I watch men whose every smile is an artifice, and every
wink is an hypocrisy. Doth such a fellow wear a mask in his (<font color='blue'><b>myself</b></font>) own privacy,
and to his (<font color='blue'><b>myself</b></font>) own conscience? If I choose to pass over an injury, I fear
`tis not from a Christian and forgiving spirit: `tis because I can
afford to remit the debt, and disdain to ask a settlement of it. One
or two sweet souls I have known in my life -LRB-and perhaps tried-RRB- to whom
forgiveness is no trouble--a plant that grows naturally, as it were, in
the soil. I know how to remit, I say, not forgive. I wonder are we proud
men proud of being proud?

<p/>So I showed not the least sign of submission towards my parent in
Virginia yonder, and we continued for years to live in estrangement,
with occasionally a brief word or two -LRB-such as the announcement of the
birth of a child, or what not-RRB- passing between my wife and her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>). After
our first troubles in America about the Stamp Act, troubles fell on me
in London likewise. Though I have been on the Tory side in our quarrel
-LRB-as indeed upon the losing side in most controversies-RRB-, having no doubt
that the Imperial Government had a full right to levy taxes in the
colonies, yet at the time of the dispute I must publish a pert letter to
a member of the House of Burgesses in Virginia, in which the question
of the habitual insolence of the mother country to the colonies was so
freely handled, and sentiments were uttered so disagreeable to persons
in power, that I was deprived of my place as hackney-coach licenser, to
the terror and horror of my uncle, who never could be brought to love
people in disgrace. He (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) had grown to have an extreme affection for
my wife as well as my little boy; but towards myself, personally,
entertained a kind of pitying contempt which always infinitely amused
me. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had a natural scorn and dislike for poverty, and a corresponding
love for success and good fortune. Any opinion departing at all from the
regular track shocked and frightened him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), and all truth-telling made him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
turn pale. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) must have had originally some warmth of heart and genuine
love of kindred: for, spite of the dreadful shocks I gave him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
continued to see Theo and the child -LRB-and me too, giving me a
mournful recognition when we met-RRB-; and though broken-hearted by my
free-spokenness, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) did not refuse to speak to me as he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had done at the
time of our first differences, but looked upon me as a melancholy lost
creature, who was past all worldly help or hope. Never mind, I must cast
about for some new scheme of life; and the repayment of Harry's debt to
me at this juncture enabled me to live at least for some months even, or
years to come. O strange fatuity of youth! I often say. How was it that
we dared to be so poor and so little cast down?

<p/>At this time his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) Majesty's royal uncle of Cumberland fell down
and perished in a fit; and, strange to say, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) death occasioned a
remarkable change in my fortune. My poor Sir Miles Warrington never
missed any court ceremony to which he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) could introduce himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) was
at all the drawing-rooms, christenings, balls, funerals of the court.
If ever a prince or princess was ailing, his (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) coach was at their door:
Leicester Fields, Carlton House, Gunnersbury, were all the same to him (<font color='blue'><b>House</b></font>),
and nothing must satisfy him (<font color='blue'><b>House</b></font>) now but going to the stout duke's funeral.
He (<font color='blue'><b>House</b></font>) caught a great cold and an inflammation of the throat from standing
bareheaded at this funeral in the rain; and one morning, before almost
I had heard of his (<font color='blue'><b>House</b></font>) illness, a lawyer waits upon me at my lodgings in
Bloomsbury, and salutes me by the name of Sir George Warrington.

<p/>Party and fear of the future were over now. We laid the poor gentleman
by the side of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) little son, in the family churchyard where so many
of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) race repose. Little Miles and I were the chief mourners. An
obsequious tenantry bowed and curtseyed before us, and did their utmost
to conciliate my honour and my worship. The dowager and her (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>) daughter
withdrew to Bath presently; and I and my family took possession of the
house, of which I have been master for thirty years. Be not too eager,
O my son! Have but a little patience, and I too shall sleep under yonder
yew-trees, and the people will be tossing up their caps for Sir Miles.

<p/>The records of a prosperous country life are easily and briefly told.
The steward's books show what rents were paid and forgiven, what crops
were raised, and in what rotation. What visitors came to us, and
how long they stayed: what pensioners my wife had, and how they were
doctored and relieved, and how they died: what year I was sheriff, and
how often the hounds met near us; all these are narrated in our house
journals, which any of my heirs may read who choose to take the
trouble. We could not afford the fine mansion in Hill Street, which
my predecessor had occupied; but we took a smaller house, in which,
however, we spent more money. We made not half the show -LRB-with liveries,
equipages, and plate-RRB- for which my uncle had been famous; but our beer
was stronger, and my wife's charities were perhaps more costly than
those of the Dowager Lady Warrington. No doubt she (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) thought there was no
harm in spoiling the Philistines; for she (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) made us pay unconscionably for
the goods she (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) left behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) in our country-house, and I submitted to
most of her (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) extortions with unutterable good-humour. What a value she (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>)
imagined the potted plants in her (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) greenhouses bore! What a price she (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>)
set upon that horrible old spinet she (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) left in her (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) drawing-room! and the
framed pieces of worsted-work, performed by the accomplished Dora and
the lovely Flora, had they been masterpieces of Titian or Vandyck, to
be sure my lady dowager could hardly have valued them at a higher price.
But though we paid so generously, though we were, I may say without
boast, far kinder to our poor than ever she (<font color='blue'><b>dowager</b></font>) had been, for a while we had
the very worst reputation in the county, where all sorts of stories
had been told to my discredit. I thought I might perhaps succeed to my
uncle's seat in Parliament, as well as to his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) landed property; but I
found, I knew not how, that I was voted to be a person of very dangerous
opinions. I would not bribe: I would not coerce my own tenants to vote
for me in the election of `68. A gentleman came down from Whitehall
with a pocket-book full of bank-notes; and I found that I had no chance
against my competitor.

<p/>Bon Dieu! Now that we were at ease in respect of worldly means,--now
that obedient tenants bowed and curtseyed as we went to church; that we
drove to visit our friends, or to the neighbouring towns, in the great
family coach with the four fat horses; did we not often regret poverty,
and the dear little cottage at Lambeth, where Want was ever prowling
at the door? Did I not long to be bear-leading again, and vow that
translating for booksellers was not such very hard drudgery? When we
went to London, we made sentimental pilgrimages to all our old haunts.
I dare say my wife embraced all her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) landladies. You may be sure we asked
all the friends of those old times to share the comforts of our new home
with us. The Reverend Mr. Hagan and his (<font color='blue'><b>Hagan</b></font>) lady visited us more than once.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Hagan</b></font>) appearance in the pulpit at B-------LRB-where he (<font color='blue'><b>Hagan</b></font>) preached very finely,
as we thought-RRB- caused an awful scandal there. Sampson came too, another
unlucky Levite, and was welcome as long as he (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) would stay among us. Mr.
Johnson talked of coming, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Johnson</b></font>) put us off once or twice. I suppose our
house was dull. I know that I myself would be silent for days, and fear
that my moodiness must often have tried the sweetest-tempered woman
in the world who lived with me. I did not care for field sports. The
killing one partridge was so like killing another, that I wondered how
men could pass days after days in the pursuit of that kind of slaughter.
Their fox-hunting stories would begin at four o’clock, when the
tablecloth was removed, and last till supper-time. I sate silent, and
listened: day after day I fell asleep: no wonder I was not popular with
my company.

<p/>What admission is this I am making? Here was the storm over, the rocks
avoided, the ship in port and the sailor not overcontented? Was Susan
I had been sighing for during the voyage, not the beauty I expected to
find her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>)? In the first place, Susan and all the family can look in her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>)
William's logbook, and so, madam, I am not going to put my secrets
down there. No, Susan, I never had secrets from thee. I never cared for
another woman. I have seen more beautiful, but none that suited me as
well as your ladyship. I have met Mrs. Carter and Miss Mulso, and Mrs.
Thrale and Madam Kaufmann, and the angelical Gunnings, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Kaufmann</b></font>) Grace of
Devonshire, and a host of beauties who were not angelic, by any means:
and I was not dazzled by them. Nay, young folks, I may have led your
mother a weary life, and been a very Bluebeard over her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), but then I
had no other heads in the closet. Only, the first pleasure of taking
possession of our kingdom over, I own I began to be quickly tired of the
crown. When the captain wears it his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) Majesty will be a very different
Prince. He (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) can ride a-hunting five days in the week, and find the sport
amusing. I believe he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) would hear the same sermon at church fifty times,
and not yawn more than I do at the first delivery. But sweet Joan,
beloved Baucis! being thy faithful husband and true lover always,
thy Darby is rather ashamed of having been testy so often! and, being
arrived at the consummation of happiness, Philemon asks pardon for
falling asleep so frequently after dinner. There came a period of my
life, when having reached the summit of felicity I was quite tired of
the prospect I had there: I yawned in Eden, and said, <div class="bookquote">``Is this all?
What, no lions to bite? no rain to fall? no thorns to prick you in the
rose-bush when you sit down?--only Eve, for ever sweet and tender, and
figs for breakfast, dinner, supper, from week's end to week's end!''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Shall I make my confessions? Hearken! Well, then, if I must make a clean
breast of it.

<p/>* * * * * *

<p/>Here three pages are torn out of Sir George Warrington's MS. book, for
which the editor is sincerely sorry.


<p/>I know the theory and practice of the Roman Church; but, being bred of
another persuasion -LRB-and sceptical and heterodox regarding that-RRB-, I can't
help doubting the other, too, and wondering whether Catholics, in
their confessions, confess all? Do we Protestants ever do so; and has
education rendered those other fellow-men so different from us? At
least, amongst us, we are not accustomed to suppose Catholic priests or
laymen more frank and open than ourselves. Which brings me back to my
question,--does any man confess all? Does yonder dear creature know all
my life, who has been the partner of it for thirty years; who, whenever
I have told her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) a sorrow, has been ready with the best of her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) gentle
power to soothe it; who has watched when I did not speak, and when I was
silent has been silent herself, or with the charming hypocrisy of woman
has worn smiles and an easy appearance so as to make me imagine she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
felt no care, or would not even ask to disturb her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) lord's secret when he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>)
seemed to indicate a desire to keep it private? Oh, the dear hypocrite!
Have I not watched her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hiding the boys' peccadilloes from papa's anger?
Have I not known her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) cheat out of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) housekeeping to pay off their
little extravagances; and talk to me with an artless face, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) did
not know that our revered captain had had dealings with the gentlemen
of Duke's Place, and our learned collegian, at the end of his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) terms, had
very pressing reasons for sporting his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) oak -LRB-as the phrase is-RRB- against
some of the University tradesmen? Why, from the very earliest days, thou
wise woman, thou wert for ever concealing something from me,--this
one stealing jam from the cupboard; that one getting into disgrace at
school; that naughty rebel -LRB-put on the caps, young folks, according to
the fit-RRB- flinging an inkstand at mamma in a rage, whilst I was told
the gown and the carpet were spoiled by accident. We all hide from one
another. We have all secrets. We are all alone. We sin by ourselves,
and, let us trust, repent too. Yonder dear woman would give her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) foot to
spare mine a twinge of the gout; but, when I have the fit, the pain is
in my slipper. At the end of the novel or the play, the hero and heroine
marry or die, and so there is an end of them as far as the poet is
concerned, who huzzas for his (<font color='blue'><b>poet</b></font>) young couple till the postchaise turns the
corner; or fetches the hearse and plumes, and shovels them underground.
But when Mr. Random and Mr. Thomas Jones are married, is all over? Are
there no quarrels at home? Are there no Lady Bellastons abroad? are
there no constables to be outrun? no temptations to conquer us, or be
conquered by us? The Sirens sang after Ulysses long after his (<font color='blue'><b>Ulysses</b></font>) marriage,
and the suitors whispered in Penelope's ear, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Ulysses</b></font>) and she (<font color='blue'><b>Penelope</b></font>) had many a
weary day of doubt and care, and so have we all. As regards money I was
put out of trouble by the inheritance I made: but does not Atra Cura
sit behind baronets as well as equites? My friends in London used to
congratulate me on my happiness. Who would not like to be master of a
good house and a good estate? But can Gumbo shut the hall-door upon blue
devils, or lay them always in a red sea of claret? Does a man sleep
the better who has four-and-twenty hours to doze in? Do his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) intellects
brighten after a sermon from the dull old vicar; a ten minutes' cackle
and flattery from the village apothecary; or the conversation of Sir
John and Sir Thomas with their ladies, who come ten moonlight muddy
miles to eat a haunch, and play a rubber? `Tis all very well to
have tradesmen bowing to your carriage-door, room made for you at
quarter-sessions, and my lady wife taken down the second or the third to
dinner: but these pleasures fade--nay, have their inconveniences. In our
part of the country, for seven years after we came to Warrington Manor,
our two what they called best neighbours were my Lord Tutbury and Sir
John Mudbrook. We are of an older date than the Mudbrooks; consequently,
my Lady Tutbury always fell to my lot, when we dined together, who
was deaf and fell asleep after dinner; or if I had Lady Mudbrook, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>)
chattered with a folly so incessant and intense, that even my wife could
hardly keep her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) complacency -LRB-consummate hypocrite as her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) ladyship is-RRB-,
knowing the rage with which I was fuming at the other's clatter. I come
to London. I show my tongue to Dr. Heberden. I pour out my catalogue of
complaints. <div class="bookquote">``Psha, my dear Sir George!''  (<font color='red'><b>the physician</b></font>)</div>says the unfeeling physician.
<div class="bookquote">``Headaches, languor, bad sleep, bad temper--''  (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div>-LRB-<div class="bookquote">``Not bad temper: Sir
George has the sweetest temper in the world, only he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) is sometimes a
little melancholy,''  (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div>says my wife.-RRB- <div class="bookquote">``--Bad sleep, bad temper,''  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>continues
the implacable doctor. <div class="bookquote">``My dear lady, his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) inheritance has been his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) ruin,
and a little poverty and a great deal of occupation would do him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) all the
good in life.''

 (<font color='red'><b>brother</b></font>)</div><p/>No, my brother Harry ought to have been the squire, with remainder to
my son Miles, of course. Harry's letters were full of gaiety and good
spirits. His (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) estate prospered: his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) negroes multiplied; his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) crops were
large; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was a member of our House of Burgesses; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) adored his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wife;
could he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) but have a child his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) happiness would be complete. Had Hal
been master of Warrington Manor-house, in my place, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>) would have been
beloved through the whole country; he (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>) would have been steward at all the
races, the gayest of all the jolly huntsmen, the bien venu at all the
mansions round about, where people scarce cared to perform the ceremony
of welcome at sight of my glum face. As for my wife, all the world liked
her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), and agreed in pitying her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>). I don't know how the report got abroad,
but `twas generally agreed that I treated her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) with awful cruelty, and
that for jealousy I was a perfect Bluebeard. Ah me! And so it is true
that I have had many dark hours; that I pass days in long silence; that
the conversation of fools and whipper-snappers makes me rebellious and
peevish, and that, when I feel contempt, I sometimes don't know how to
conceal it, or I should say did not. I hope as I grow older I grow more
charitable. Because I do not love bawling and galloping after a fox,
like the captain yonder, I am not his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) superior; but, in this respect,
humbly own that he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) is mine. He (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) has perceptions which are denied me;
enjoyments which I cannot understand. Because I am blind the world is
not dark. I try now and listen with respect when Squire Codgers talks
of the day's run. I do my best to laugh when Captain Rattleton tells his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>)
garrison stories. I step up to the harpsichord with old Miss Humby -LRB-our
neighbour from Beccles-RRB- and try and listen as she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) warbles her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) ancient
ditties. I play whist laboriously. Am I not trying to do the duties of
life? and I have a right to be garrulous and egotistical, because I have
been reading Montaigne all the morning.

<p/>I was not surprised, knowing by what influences my brother was led, to
find his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) name in the list of Virginia burgesses who declared that the
sole right of imposing taxes on the inhabitants of this colony is now,
and ever hath been, legally and constitutionally vested in the House
of Burgesses, and called upon the other colonies to pray for the Royal
interposition in favour of the violated rights of America. And it was
now, after we had been some three years settled in our English home,
that a correspondence between us and Madam Esmond began to take place.
It was my wife who -LRB-upon some pretext such as women always know how to
find-RRB- re-established the relations between us. Mr. Miles must need have
the small-pox, from which he (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) miraculously recovered without losing
any portion of his (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) beauty; and on his (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) recovery the mother writes her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
prettiest little wheedling letter to the grandmother of the fortunate
babe. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) coaxes her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) with all sorts of modest phrases and humble
offerings of respect and goodwill. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) narrates anecdotes of the
precocious genius of the lad -LRB-what hath subsequently happened, I wonder,
to stop the growth of that gallant young officer's brains?-RRB-, and she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
must have sent over to his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) grandmother a lock of the darling boy's hair,
for the old lady, in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) reply, acknowledged the receipt of some such
present. I wonder, as it came from England, they allowed it to pass our
custom-house at Williamsburg. In return for these peace-offerings and
smuggled tokens of submission, comes a tolerably gracious letter from my
Lady of Castlewood. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) inveighs against the dangerous spirit pervading
the colony: she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) laments to think that her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) unhappy son is consorting with
people who, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) fears, will be no better than rebels and traitors. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>)
does not wonder, considering who his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) friends and advisers are. How can
a wife taken from an almost menial situation be expected to sympathise
with persons of rank and dignity who have the honour of the Crown at
heart? If evil times were coming for the monarchy -LRB-for the folks in
America appeared to be disinclined to pay taxes, and required that
everything should be done for them without cost-RRB-, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) remembered how
to monarchs in misfortune, the Esmonds--her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) father the Marquis
especially--had ever been faithful. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) knew not what opinions -LRB-though
she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) might judge from my newfangled Lord Chatham-RRB- were in fashion in
England. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) prayed, at least, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) might hear that one of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) sons was
not on the side of rebellion. When we came, in after days, to look over
old family papers in Virginia, we found <div class="bookquote">``Letters from my daughter Lady
Warrington,''  (<font color='red'><b>family</b></font>)</div>neatly tied up with a ribbon. My Lady Theo insisted I
should not open them; and the truth, I believe, is, that they were so
full of praises of her (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) husband that she (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) thought my vanity would suffer
from reading them.

<p/>When Madam began to write, she (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) gave us brief notices of Harry and his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
wife. <div class="bookquote">``The two women,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) wrote, <div class="bookquote">``still govern everything with my poor
boy at Fannystown -LRB-as he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) chooses to call his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) house-RRB-. They must save
money there, for I hear but a shabby account of their manner of
entertaining. The Mount Vernon gentleman continues to be his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) great
friend, and he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) votes in the House of Burgesses very much as his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
guide advises him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>). Why he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) should be so sparing of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) money I cannot
understand: I heard, of five negroes who went with his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) equipages to my
Lord Bottetourt's, only two had shoes to their feet. I had reasons to
save, having sons for whom I wished to provide, but he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) hath no children,
wherein he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) certainly is spared from much grief, though, no doubt, Heaven
in its wisdom means our good by the trials which, through our children,
it causes us to endure. His (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) mother-in-law,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) added in one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>)
letters, <div class="bookquote">``has been ailing. Ever since his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) marriage, my poor Henry has
been the creature of these two artful women, and they rule him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) entirely.
Nothing, my dear daughter, is more contrary to common sense and to
Holy Scripture than this. Are we not told, Wives, be obedient to your
husbands? Had Mr. Warrington lived, I should have endeavoured to follow
up that sacred precept, holding that nothing so becomes a woman as
humility and obedience.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Presently we had a letter sealed with black, and announcing the death
of our dear good Mountain, for whom I had a hearty regret and affection,
remembering her (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) sincere love for us as children. Harry deplored the
event in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) honest way, and with tears which actually blotted his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
paper. And Madam Esmond, alluding to the circumstance, said: <div class="bookquote">``My late
housekeeper, Mrs. Mountain, as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mountain</b></font>) found her (<font color='blue'><b>Mountain</b></font>) illness was fatal,
sent to me requesting a last interview on her (<font color='blue'><b>Mountain</b></font>) deathbed, intending,
doubtless, to pray my forgiveness for her (<font color='blue'><b>Mountain</b></font>) treachery towards me. I sent
her (<font color='blue'><b>Mountain</b></font>) word that I could forgive her (<font color='blue'><b>Mountain</b></font>) as a Christian, and heartily hope
-LRB-though I confess I doubt it-RRB- that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mountain</b></font>) had a due sense of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mountain</b></font>) crime
towards me. But our meeting, I considered, was of no use, and could
only occasion unpleasantness between us. If she (<font color='blue'><b>Mountain</b></font>) repented, though at the
eleventh hour, it was not too late, and I sincerely trusted that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mountain</b></font>)
was now doing so. And, would you believe her (<font color='blue'><b>Mountain</b></font>) lamentable and hardened
condition? she (<font color='blue'><b>Mountain</b></font>) sent me word through Dinah, my woman, whom I dispatched
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mountain</b></font>) with medicines for her (<font color='blue'><b>Mountain</b></font>) soul's and her (<font color='blue'><b>Mountain</b></font>) body's health, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mountain</b></font>)
had nothing to repent of as far as regarded her (<font color='blue'><b>Mountain</b></font>) conduct to me, and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Mountain</b></font>) wanted to be left alone! Poor Dinah distributed the medicine to my
negroes, and our people took it eagerly--whilst Mrs. Mountain, left to
herself, succumbed to the fever. Oh, the perversity of human kind! This
poor creature was too proud to take my remedies, and is now beyond the
reach of cure and physicians. You tell me your little Miles is subject
to fits of cholic. My remedy, and I will beg you to let me know if
effectual, is,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madam Esmond/Madam Esmond Warrington/Madam Warrington</b></font>)</div>etc. etc.--and here followed the prescription, which
thou didst not take, O my son, my heir, and my pride! because thy fond
mother had her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) mother's favourite powder, on which in his (<font color='blue'><b>heir</b></font>) infantine
troubles our firstborn was dutifully nurtured. Did words not exactly
consonant with truth pass between the ladies in their correspondence? I
fear my Lady Theo was not altogether candid: else how to account for a
phrase in one of Madam Esmond's letters, who said: <div class="bookquote">``I am glad to hear
the powders have done the dear child good. They are, if not on a first,
on a second or third application, almost infallible, and have been
the blessed means of relieving many persons round me, both infants and
adults, white and coloured. I send my grandson an Indian bow and arrows.
Shall these old eyes never behold him (<font color='blue'><b>grandson</b></font>) at Castlewood, I wonder, and is
Sir George so busy with his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) books and his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) politics that he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) can't afford
a few months to his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) mother in Virginia? I am much alone now. My son's
chamber is just as he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) left it: the same books are in the presses: his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
little hanger and fowling-piece over the bed, and my father's picture
over the mantelpiece. I never allow anything to be altered in his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) room
or his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) brother's. I fancy the children playing near me sometimes, and
that I can see my dear father's head as he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) dozes in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) chair. Mine is
growing almost as white as my father's. Am I never to behold my children
ere I go hence? The Lord's will be done.''




 (<font color='red'><b>Madam Esmond/Madam Esmond Warrington/Madam Warrington</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER LXXXVI. At Home


<p/>Such an appeal as this of our mother would have softened hearts much
less obdurate than ours; and we talked of a speedy visit to Virginia,
and of hiring all the Young Rachel's cabin accommodation. But our child
must fall ill, for whom the voyage would be dangerous, and from whom the
mother of course could not part; and the Young Rachel made her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) voyage
without us that year. Another year there was another difficulty, in my
worship's first attack of the gout -LRB-which occupied me a good deal, and
afterwards certainly cleared my wits and enlivened my spirits-RRB-; and now
came another much sadder cause for delay in the sad news we received
from Jamaica. Some two years after our establishment at the Manor,
our dear General returned from his (<font color='blue'><b>Young</b></font>) government, a little richer in the
world's goods than when he (<font color='blue'><b>Young</b></font>) went away, but having undergone a loss for
which no wealth could console him (<font color='blue'><b>Young</b></font>), and after which, indeed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Young</b></font>) did
not care to remain in the West Indies. My Theo's poor mother--the most
tender and affectionate friend -LRB-save one-RRB- I have ever had--died abroad
of the fever. Her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) last regret was that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) should not be allowed to live
to see our children and ourselves in prosperity.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) sees us, though we do not see her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>); and she (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) thanks you, George, for
having been good to her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) children,''  (<font color='red'><b>husband</b></font>)</div>her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) husband said.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), we thought, would not be long ere he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) joined her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). His (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) love for her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
had been the happiness and business of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) whole life. To be away from
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) seemed living no more. It was pitiable to watch the good man as
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sate with us. My wife, in her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) air and in many tones and gestures,
constantly recalled her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) mother to the bereaved widower's heart. What
cheer we could give him (<font color='blue'><b>widower</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>widower</b></font>) calamity we offered; but, especially,
little Hetty was now, under Heaven, his (<font color='blue'><b>widower</b></font>) chief support and consolation.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) had refused more than one advantageous match in the Island, the
General told us; and on her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) return to England, my Lord Wrotham's heir
laid himself at her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) feet. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) loved best to stay with her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) father,
Hetty said. As long as he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was not tired of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) cared for no husband.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said we, when this last great match was proposed, <div class="bookquote">``let the
General stay six months with us at the Manor here, and you can have him (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>)
at Oakhurst for the other six.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hetty/Miss Hetty/Lambert</b></font>)</div><p/>But Hetty declared her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) father never could bear Oakhurst again now that
her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) mother was gone; and she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) would marry no man for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) coronet and
money--not she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)! The General, when we talked this matter over, said
gravely that the child had no desire for marrying, owing possibly to
some disappointment in early life, of which she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) never spoke; and we,
respecting her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) feelings, were for our parts equally silent. My brother
Lambert had by this time a college living near to Winchester, and a wife
of course to adorn his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) parsonage. We professed but a moderate degree of
liking for this lady, though we made her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) welcome when she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) came to us.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) idea regarding our poor Hetty's determined celibacy was different
to that which I had. This Mrs. Jack was a chatterbox of a woman, in
the habit of speaking her (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) mind very freely, and of priding herself
excessively on her (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) skill in giving pain to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) friends.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear Sir George,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) was pleased to say, <div class="bookquote">``I have often and often
told our dear Theo that I wouldn't have a pretty sister in my house to
make tea for Jack when I was upstairs, and always to be at hand when I
was wanted in the kitchen or nursery, and always to be dressed neat and
in her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) best when I was very likely making pies or puddings or looking to
the children. I have every confidence in Jack, of course. I should like
to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) look at another woman, indeed! And so I have in Jemima but
they don't come together in my house when I'm upstairs--that I promise
you! And so I told my sister Warrington.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Am I to understand,''  (<font color='red'><b>the General</b></font>)</div>says the General, <div class="bookquote">``that you have done my Lady
Warrington the favour to warn her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) against her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) sister, my daughter Miss
Hester?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the General</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, pa, of course I have. A duty is a duty, and a woman is a woman,
and a man's a man, as I know very well. Don't tell me! He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is a man.
Every man is a man, with all his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sanctified airs!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You yourself have a married sister, with whom you were staying when my
son Jack first had the happiness of making your acquaintance?''  (<font color='red'><b>the General</b></font>)</div>remarks
the General.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, of course I have a married sister; every one knows that and I have
been as good as a mother to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) children, that I have!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And am I to gather from your conversation that your attractions proved
a powerful temptation for your sister's husband?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Law, General! I don't know how you can go for to say I ever said any
such a thing!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Jack</b></font>)</div>cries Mrs. Jack, red and voluble.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't you perceive, my dear madam, that it is you who have insinuated
as much, not only regarding yourself, but regarding my own two
daughters?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never, never, never, as I'm a Christian woman! And it's most cruel of
you to say so, sir. And I do say a sister is best out of the house, that
I do! And as Theo's time is coming, I warn her (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>), that's all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you discovered, my good madam, whether my poor Hetty has stolen
any of the spoons? When I came to breakfast this morning, my daughter
was alone, and there must have been a score of pieces of silver on the
table.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Law, sir! who ever said a word about spoons? Did I ever accuse the poor
dear? If I did, may I drop down dead at this moment on this hearth-rug!
And I ain't used to be spoke to in this way. And me and Jack have both
remarked it; and I've done my duty, that I have.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Jack</b></font>)</div>And here Mrs. Jack
flounces out of the room, in tears.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And has the woman had the impudence to tell you this, my child?''
 (<font color='red'><b>the General</b></font>)</div>asks the General, when Theo -LRB-who is a little delicate-RRB- comes to the
tea-table.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) has told me every day since she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) has been here. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) comes into my
dressing-room to tell me. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) comes to my nursery, and says, `Ah, I
wouldn't have a sister prowling about my nursery, that I wouldn't.' Ah,
how pleasant it is to have amiable and well-bred relatives, say I.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the General</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thy poor mother has been spared this woman,''  (<font color='red'><b>the General</b></font>)</div>groans the General.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Our mother would have made her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) better, papa,''  (<font color='red'><b>Theo/Lady Theo</b></font>)</div>says Theo, kissing him (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, dear.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>And I see that both of them are at their prayers.

<p/>But this must be owned, that to love one's relatives is not always an
easy task; to live with one's neighbours is sometimes not amusing. From
Jack Lambert's demeanour next day, I could see that his (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) wife had given
him (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) version of the conversation. Jack was sulky, but not dignified.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) was angry, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) anger did not prevent his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) appetite. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) preached a
sermon for us which was entirely stupid. And little Miles, once more in
sables, sate at his (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) grandfather's side, his (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) little hand placed in that
of the kind old man.

<p/>Would he (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) stay and keep house for us during our Virginian trip? The
housekeeper should be put under the full domination of Hetty. The
butler's keys should be handed over to him (<font color='blue'><b>butler</b></font>); for Gumbo, not I thought
with an over good grace, was to come with us to Virginia: having,
it must be premised, united himself with Mrs. Molly in the bonds of
matrimony, and peopled a cottage in my park with sundry tawny Gumbos.
Under the care of our good General and his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) daughter we left our house,
then; we travelled to London, and thence to Bristol, and our obsequious
agent there had the opportunity of declaring that he (<font color='blue'><b>agent</b></font>) should offer up
prayers for our prosperity, and of vowing that children so beautiful as
ours -LRB-we had an infant by this time to accompany Miles-RRB- were never seen
on any ship before. We made a voyage without accident. How strange the
feeling was as we landed from our boat at Richmond! A coach and a host
of negroes were there in waiting to receive us; and hard by a gentleman
on horseback, with negroes in our livery, too, who sprang from his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) horse
and rushed up to embrace us. Not a little charmed were both of us to see
our dearest Hal. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>) rode with us to our mother's door. Yonder she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) stood
on the steps to welcome us; and Theo knelt down to ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) blessing.

<p/>Harry rode in the coach with us as far as our mother's house; but would
not, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said, spoil sport by entering with us. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) sees me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
owned, <div class="bookquote">``and we are pretty good friends; but Fanny and she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) are best
apart; and there is no love lost between `em, I can promise you. Come
over to me at the Tavern, George, when thou art free. And to-morrow I
shall have the honour to present her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) sister to Theo. `Twas only from
happening to be in town yesterday that I heard the ship was signalled,
and waited to see you. I have sent a negro boy home to my wife, and
she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)'ll be here to pay her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) respects to my Lady Warrington.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And Harry,
after this brief greeting, jumped out of the carriage, and left us to
meet our mother alone.

<p/>Since I parted from her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) I had seen a great deal of fine company, and
Theo and I had paid our respects to the King and Queen at St. James's;
but we had seen no more stately person than this who welcomed us, and
raising my wife from her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) knee, embraced her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) and led her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) into the house.
`Twas a plain, wood-built place, with a gallery round, as our Virginian
houses are; but if it had been a palace, with a little empress inside,
our reception could not have been more courteous. There was old Nathan,
still the major-domo, a score of kind black faces of blacks, grinning
welcome. Some whose names I remembered as children were grown out of
remembrance, to be sure, to be buxom lads and lasses; and some I had
left with black pates were grizzling now with snowy polls: and some who
were born since my time were peering at doorways with their great eyes
and little naked feet. It was, <div class="bookquote">``I'm little Sip, Master George!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>and <div class="bookquote">``I'm
Dinah, Sir George!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>and <div class="bookquote">``I'm Master Miles's boy!''  (<font color='red'><b>a chap</b></font>)</div>says a little chap in
a new livery and boots of nature's blacking. Ere the day was over the
whole household had found a pretext for passing before us, and grinning
and bowing and making us welcome. I don't know how many repasts were
served to us. In the evening my Lady Warrington had to receive all
the gentry of the little town, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) did with perfect grace and
good-humour, and I had to shake hands with a few old acquaintances--old
enemies I was going to say; but I had come into a fortune and was no
longer a naughty prodigal. Why, a drove of fatted calves was killed
in my honour! My poor Hal was of the entertainment, but gloomy and
crestfallen. His (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>) mother spoke to him (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>), but it was as a queen to a
rebellious prince, her (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) son who was not yet forgiven. We two slipped away
from the company, and went up to the rooms assigned to me: but there, as
we began a free conversation, our mother, taper in hand, appeared with
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) pale face. Did I want anything? Was everything quite as I wished
it? She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had peeped in at the dearest children, who were sleeping like
cherubs. How she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) did caress them, and delight over them! How she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was
charmed with Miles's dominating airs, and the little Theo's smiles and
dimples! <div class="bookquote">``Supper is just coming on the table, Sir George. If you like
our cookery better than the tavern, Henry, I beg you to stay.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>What a
different welcome there was in the words and tone addressed to each of
us! Hal hung down his (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>) head, and followed to the lower room. A clergyman
begged a blessing on the meal. He (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) touched with not a little art and
eloquence upon our arrival at home, upon our safe passage across the
stormy waters, upon the love and forgiveness which awaited us in the
mansions of the Heavenly Parent when the storms of life were over.

<p/>Here was a new clergyman, quite unlike some whom I remembered about us
in earlier days, and I praised him (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>), but Madam Esmond shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) head. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>)
was afraid his (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) principles were very dangerous: she (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) was afraid others had
adopted those dangerous principles. Had I not seen the paper signed by
the burgesses and merchants at Williamsburg the year before--the Lees,
Randolphs, Bassets, Washingtons, and the like, and oh, my dear, that
I should have to say it, our name, that is, your brother's -LRB-by what
influence I do not like to say-RRB-, and this unhappy Mr. Belman's who
begged a blessing last night?

<p/>If there had been quarrels in our little colonial society when I left
home, what were these to the feuds I found raging on my return? We had
sent the Stamp Act to America, and been forced to repeal it. Then we
must try a new set of duties on glass, paper, and what not, and repeal
that Act too, with the exception of a duty on tea. From Boston to
Charleston the tea was confiscated. Even my mother, loyal as she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was,
gave up her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) favourite drink; and my poor wife would have had to forgo
hers, but we had brought a quantity for our private drinking on board
ship, which had paid four times as much duty at home. Not that I for my
part would have hesitated about paying duty. The home Government must
have some means of revenue, or its pretensions to authority were idle.
They say the colonies were tried and tyrannised over; I say the home
Government was tried and tyrannised over. -LSB-`Tis but an affair of
argument and history, now; we tried the question, and were beat; and
the matter is settled as completely as the conquest of Britain by the
Normans.-RRB- And all along, from conviction I trust, I own to have
taken the British side of the quarrel. In that brief and unfortunate
experience of war which I had had in my early life, the universal cry of
the army and well-affected persons was, that Mr. Braddock's expedition
had failed, and defeat and disaster had fallen upon us in consequence
of the remissness, the selfishness, and the rapacity of many of the very
people for whose defence against the French arms had been taken up. The
colonists were for having all done for them, and for doing nothing, They
made extortionate bargains with the champions who came to defend them;
they failed in contracts; they furnished niggardly supplies; they
multiplied delays until the hour for beneficial action was past, and
until the catastrophe came which never need have occurred but for their
ill-will. What shouts of joy were there, and what ovations for the great
British Minister who had devised and effected the conquest of Canada!
Monsieur de Vaudreuil said justly that that conquest was the signal for
the defection of the North American colonies from their allegiance to
Great Britain; and my Lord Chatham, having done his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) best to achieve
the first part of the scheme, contributed more than any man in England
towards the completion of it. The colonies were insurgent, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
applauded their rebellion. What scores of thousands of waverers must he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
have encouraged into resistance! It was a general who says to an army
in revolt, <div class="bookquote">``God save the king! My men, you have a right to mutiny!''  (<font color='red'><b>a general</b></font>)</div>No
wonder they set up his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) statue in this town, and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) picture in t'other;
whilst here and there they hanged Ministers and Governors in effigy.
To our Virginian town of Williamsburg, some wiseacres must subscribe
to bring over a portrait of my lord, in the habit of a Roman orator
speaking in the Forum, to be sure, and pointing to the palace of
Whitehall, and the special window out of which Charles I. was beheaded!
Here was a neat allegory, and a pretty compliment to a British
statesman! I hear, however, that my lord's head was painted from a bust,
and so was taken off without his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) knowledge.

<p/>Now my country is England, not America or Virginia; and I take, or
rather took, the English side of the dispute. My sympathies had always
been with home, where I was now a squire and a citizen: but had my lot
been to plant tobacco, and live on the banks of James River or Potomac,
no doubt my opinions had been altered. When, for instance, I visited
my brother at his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) new house and plantation, I found him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) wife as
staunch Americans as we were British. We had some words upon the matter
in dispute,--who had not in those troublesome times?--but our argument
was carried on without rancour; even my new sister could not bring us to
that, though she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) did her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) best when we were together, and in the curtain
lectures which I have no doubt she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) inflicted on her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) spouse, like a
notable housewife as she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) was. But we trusted in each other so entirely
that even Harry's duty towards his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wife would not make him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) quarrel with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) brother. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) loved me from old times, when my word was law with him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>);
he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) still protested that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) and every Virginian gentleman of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) side
was loyal to the Crown. War was not declared as yet, and gentlemen of
different opinions were courteous enough to one another. Nay, at
our public dinners and festivals, the health of the King was still
ostentatiously drunk; and the assembly of every colony, though preparing
for Congress, though resisting all attempts at taxation on the part of
the home authorities, was loud in its expressions of regard for the King
our Father, and pathetic in its appeals to that paternal sovereign
to put away evil counsellors from him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>), and listen to the voice of
moderation and reason. Up to the last, our Virginian gentry were a
grave, orderly, aristocratic folk, with the strongest sense of their own
dignity and station. In later days, and nearer home, we have heard of
fraternisation and equality. Amongst the great folks of our Old World I
have never seen a gentleman standing more on his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) dignity and maintaining
it better than Mr. Washington: no--not the King against whom he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) took
arms. In the eyes of all the gentry of the French court, who gaily
joined in the crusade against us, and so took their revenge for Canada,
the great American chief always appeared as anax andron, and they
allowed that his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) better could not be seen in Versailles itself. Though
they were quarrelling with the Governor, the gentlemen of the House of
Burgesses still maintained amicable relations with him (<font color='blue'><b>Governor</b></font>), and exchanged
dignified courtesies. When my Lord Bottetourt arrived, and held his (<font color='blue'><b>Bottetourt</b></font>)
court at Williamsburg in no small splendour and state, all the gentry
waited upon him (<font color='blue'><b>gentry</b></font>), Madam Esmond included. And at his (<font color='blue'><b>gentry</b></font>) death, Lord Dunmore,
who succeeded him (<font color='blue'><b>Dunmore</b></font>), and brought a fine family with him (<font color='blue'><b>Dunmore</b></font>), was treated with
the utmost respect by our gentry privately, though publicly the House of
Assembly and the Governor were at war.

<p/>Their quarrels are a matter of history, and concern me personally only
so far as this, that our burgesses being convened for the 1st of March
in the year after my arrival in Virginia, it was agreed that we should
all pay a visit to our capital, and our duty to the Governor. Since
Harry's unfortunate marriage Madam Esmond had not performed this duty,
though always previously accustomed to pay it; but now that her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) eldest
son was arrived in the colony, my mother opined that we must certainly
wait upon his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) Excellency the Governor, nor were we sorry, perhaps,
to get away from our little Richmond to enjoy the gaieties of the
provincial capital. Madam engaged, and at a great price, the best house
to be had at Richmond for herself and her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) family. Now I was rich, her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
generosity was curious. I had more than once to interpose -LRB-her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) old
servants likewise wondering at her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) new way of life-RRB-, and beg her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) not to
be so lavish. But she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) gently said, in former days she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had occasion to
save, which now existed no more. Harry had enough, sure, with such a
wife as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had taken out of the housekeeper's room. If she (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) chose to be a
little extravagant now, why should she (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) hesitate? She (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) had not her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) dearest
daughter and grandchildren with her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) every day -LRB-she (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) fell in love with all
three of them, and spoiled them as much as they were capable of being
spoiled-RRB-. Besides, in former days I could not accuse her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) of too much
extravagance, and this I think was almost the only allusion she (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) made to
the pecuniary differences between us. So she (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) had her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) people dressed in
their best, and her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) best wines, plate, and furniture from Castlewood by
sea at no small charge, and her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) dress in which she (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) had been married in
George II.'s reign, and we all flattered ourselves that our coach made
the greatest figure of any except his (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) Excellency's, and we engaged
Signor Formicalo, his (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) Excellency's major-domo, to superintend the series
of feasts that were given in my honour; and more fleshpots were set
a-stewing in our kitchens in one month, our servants said, than had been
known in the family since the young gentlemen went away. So great was
Theo's influence over my mother, that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) actually persuaded her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), that
year, to receive our sister Fanny, Hal's wife, who would have stayed
upon the plantation rather than face Madam Esmond. But, trusting to
Theo's promise of amnesty, Fanny -LRB-to whose house we had paid more than
one visit-RRB- came up to town, and made her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) curtsey to Madam Esmond, and
was forgiven. And rather than be forgiven in that way, I own, for my
part, that I would prefer perdition or utter persecution.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You know these, my dear?''  (<font color='red'><b>Madam Esmond/Madam Esmond Warrington/Madam Warrington</b></font>)</div>says Madam Esmond, pointing to her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) fine
silver sconces. <div class="bookquote">``Fanny hath often cleaned them when she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was with me
at Castlewood. And this dress, too, Fanny knows, I dare say? Her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) poor
mother had the care of it. I always had the greatest confidence in her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Lady Fanny</b></font>)</div><p/>Here there is wrath flashing from Fanny's eyes, which our mother, who
has forgiven her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), does not perceive--not she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)!

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was a treasure to me!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Madam resumes. <div class="bookquote">``I never should have
nursed my boys through their illnesses but for your mother's admirable
care of them. Colonel Lee, permit me to present you to my daughter,
my Lady Warrington. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) ladyship is a neighbour of your relatives the
Bunburys at home. Here comes his (<font color='blue'><b>Lee</b></font>) Excellency. Welcome, my lord!''

 (<font color='red'><b>princess</b></font>)</div><p/>And our princess performs before his (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) lordship one of those curtseys of
which she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) was not a little proud; and I fancy I see some of the company
venturing to smile.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``By George! madam,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lee/Mr. Lee</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Lee, <div class="bookquote">``since Count Borulawski, I have not
seen a bow so elegant as your ladyship's.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lee/Mr. Lee</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And pray, sir, who was Count Borulawski?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>asks Madam.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) was a nobleman high in favour with his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) Polish Majesty,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lee/Mr. Lee</b></font>)</div>replies Mr.
Lee. <div class="bookquote">``May I ask you, madam, to present me to your distinguished son?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``This is Sir George Warrington,''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>says my mother, pointing to me.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Pardon me, madam. I meant Captain Warrington, who was by Mr. Wolfe's
side when he (<font color='blue'><b>Wolfe</b></font>) died. I had been contented to share his (<font color='blue'><b>Wolfe</b></font>) fate, so I had been
near him (<font color='blue'><b>Wolfe</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lee/Mr. Lee</b></font>)</div><p/>And the ardent Lee swaggers up to Harry, and takes his (<font color='blue'><b>Lee</b></font>) hand with
respect, and pays him (<font color='blue'><b>Lee</b></font>) a compliment or two, which makes me, at least,
pardon him (<font color='blue'><b>Lee</b></font>) for his (<font color='blue'><b>Lee</b></font>) late impertinence; for my dearest Hal walks gloomily
through his (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>) mother's rooms in his (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>) old uniform of the famous corps which
he (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>) has quitted.

<p/>We had had many meetings, which the stern mother could not interrupt,
and in which that instinctive love which bound us to one another, and
which nothing could destroy, had opportunity to speak. Entirely unlike
each other in our pursuits, our tastes, our opinions--his (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>) life being one
of eager exercise, active sport, and all the amusements of the field,
while mine is to dawdle over books and spend my time in languid
self-contemplation--we have, nevertheless, had such a sympathy as almost
passes the love of women. My poor Hal confessed as much to me, for
his (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>) part, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>) artless manner, when we went away without wives or
womankind, except a few negroes left in the place, and passed a week at
Castlewood together.

<p/>The ladies did not love each other. I know enough of my Lady Theo,
to see after a very few glances whether or not she (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) takes a liking to
another of her (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) amiable sex. All my powers of persuasion or command fail
to change the stubborn creature's opinion. Had she (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) ever said a word
against Mrs. This or Miss That? Not she (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>)! Has she (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) been otherwise than
civil? No, assuredly! My Lady Theo is polite to a beggar-woman, treats
her (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) kitchenmaids like duchesses, and murmurs a compliment to the dentist
for his (<font color='blue'><b>dentist</b></font>) elegant manner of pulling her (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) tooth out. She (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) would black my
boots, or clean the grate, if I ordained it -LRB-always looking like a
duchess the while-RRB-; but as soon as I say to her (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``My dear creature, be
fond of this lady, or t'other!''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>all obedience ceases; she (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) executes the
most refined curtseys; smiles and kisses even to order; but performs
that mysterious undefinable freemasonic signal, which passes between
women, by which each knows that the other hates her (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>). So, with regard
to Fanny, we had met at her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) house, and at others. I remembered her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
affectionately from old days, I fully credited poor Hal's violent
protests and tearful oaths, that, by George, it was our mother's
persecution which made him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) marry her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) couldn't stand by and see a
poor thing tortured as she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was, without coming to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) rescue; no,
by heavens, he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) couldn't! I say I believed all this; and had for my
sister-in-law a genuine compassion, as well as an early regard; and yet
I had no love to give her (<font color='blue'><b>sister-in-law</b></font>); and, in reply to Hal's passionate outbreaks
in praise of her (<font color='blue'><b>sister-in-law</b></font>) beauty and worth, and eager queries to me whether I
did not think her (<font color='blue'><b>sister-in-law</b></font>) a perfect paragon? I could only answer with faint
compliments or vague approval, feeling all the while that I was
disappointing my poor ardent fellow, and cursing inwardly that revolt
against flattery and falsehood into which I sometimes frantically rush.
Why should I not say, <div class="bookquote">``Yes dear Hal, thy wife is a paragon; her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) singing
is delightful, her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) hair and shape are beautiful;''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>as I might have said
by a little common stretch of politeness? Why could I not cajole this
or that stupid neighbour or relative, as I have heard Theo do a thousand
times, finding all sorts of lively prattle to amuse them, whilst I sit
before them dumb and gloomy? I say it was a sin not to have more words
to say in praise of Fanny. We ought to have praised her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), we ought to
have liked her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>). My Lady Warrington certainly ought to have liked her (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>),
for she (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) can play the hypocrite, and I cannot. And there was this young
creature--pretty, graceful, shaped like a nymph, with beautiful black
eyes--and we cared for them no more than for two gooseberries!
At Warrington my wife and I, when we pretended to compare notes,
elaborately complimented each other on our new sister's beauty. What
lovely eyes!--Oh yes! What a sweet little dimple on her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) chin!--Ah oui!
What wonderful little feet!--Perfectly Chinese! where should we in
London get slippers small enough for her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)? And, these compliments
exhausted, we knew that we did not like Fanny the value of one
penny-piece; we knew that we disliked her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>); we knew that we ha... Well,
what hypocrites women are! We heard from many quarters how eagerly my
brother had taken up the new anti-English opinion, and what a champion
he (<font color='blue'><b>champion</b></font>) was of so-called American rights and freedom. <div class="bookquote">``It is her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) doing, my
dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>says I to my wife. <div class="bookquote">``If I had said so much, I am sure you
would have scolded me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Warrington</b></font>)</div>says my Lady Warrington, laughing: and I did
straightway begin to scold her (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>), and say it was most cruel of her (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) to
suspect our new sister; and what earthly right had we to do so? But
I say again, I know Madam Theo so well, that when once she (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) has got a
prejudice against a person in her (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) little head, not all the king's horses
nor all the king's men will get it out again. I vow nothing would induce
her (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) to believe that Harry was not henpecked--nothing.

<p/>Well, we went to Castlewood together without the women, and stayed at
the dreary, dear old place, where we had been so happy, and I, at least,
so gloomy. It was winter, and duck-time, and Harry went away to the
river, and shot dozens and scores and bushels of canvasbacks, whilst I
remained in my grandfather's library amongst the old mouldering books
which I loved in my childhood--which I see in a dim vision still resting
on a little boy's lap, as he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) sits by an old white-headed gentleman's
knee. I read my books; I slept in my own bed and room--religiously kept,
as my mother told me, and left as on the day when I went to Europe.
Hal's cheery voice would wake me, as of old. Like all men who love to
go a-field, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>) was an early riser: he (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>) would come and wake me, and sit
on the foot of the bed and perfume the air with his (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>) morning pipe, as
the house negroes laid great logs on the fire. It was a happy time! Old
Nathan had told me of cunning crypts where ancestral rum and claret
were deposited. We had had cares, struggles, battles, bitter griefs, and
disappointments; we were boys again as we sat there together. I am a boy
now even as I think of the time.

<p/>That unlucky tea-tax, which alone of the taxes lately imposed upon the
colonies, the home Government was determined to retain, was met with
defiance throughout America. `Tis true we paid a shilling in the pound
at home, and asked only threepence from Boston or Charleston; but as a
question of principle, the impost was refused by the provinces, which
indeed ever showed a most spirited determination to pay as little as
they could help. In Charleston the tea-ships were unloaded, and the
cargoes stored in cellars. From New York and Philadelphia, the vessels
were turned back to London. In Boston -LRB-where there was an armed force,
whom the inhabitants were perpetually mobbing-RRB-, certain patriots,
painted and disguised as Indians, boarded the ships, and flung the
obnoxious cargoes into the water. The wrath of our white Father was
kindled against this city of Mohocks in masquerade. The notable Boston
Port Bill was brought forward in the British House of Commons; the port
was closed, and the Custom House removed to Salem. The Massachusetts
Charter was annulled; and,--in just apprehension that riots might ensue,
in dealing with the perpetrators of which the colonial courts might be
led to act partially,--Parliament decreed that persons indicted for
acts of violence and armed resistance, might be sent home, or to
another colony, for trial. If such acts set all America in a flame, they
certainly drove all wellwisbers of our country into a fury. I might have
sentenced Master Miles Warrington, at five years old, to a whipping, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) would have cried, taken down his (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) little small-clothes and submitted:
but suppose I offered -LRB-and he (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) richly deserving it-RRB- to chastise Captain
Miles of the Prince's Dragoons? He (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) would whirl my paternal cane out of
my hand, box my hair-powder out of my ears. Lord a-mercy! I tremble at
the very idea of the controversy? He (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) would assert his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) independence in
a word; and if, I say, I think the home Parliament had a right to levy
taxes in the colonies, I own that we took means most captious, most
insolent, most irritating, and, above all, most impotent, to assert our
claim.

<p/>My Lord Dunmore, our Governor of Virginia, upon Lord Bottetourt's death,
received me into some intimacy soon after my arrival in the colony,
being willing to live on good terms with all our gentry. My mother's
severe loyalty was no secret to him (<font color='blue'><b>gentry</b></font>); indeed, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) waved the king's banner
in all companies, and talked so loudly and resolutely, that Randolph and
Patrick Henry himself were struck dumb before her (<font color='blue'><b>Randolph</b></font>). It was Madam Esmond's
celebrated reputation for loyalty -LRB-his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) Excellency laughingly told me-RRB-
which induced him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) to receive her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) eldest son to grace.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have had the worst character of you from home,''  (<font color='red'><b>lordship</b></font>)</div>his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) lordship said.
<div class="bookquote">``Little birds whisper to me, Sir George, that you are a man of the
most dangerous principles. You are a friend of Mr. Wilkes and Alderman
Beckford. I am not sure you have not been at Medmenham Abbey. You have
lived with players, poets, and all sorts of wild people. I have been
warned against you, sir, and I find you--''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not so black as I have been painted,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I interrupted his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) lordship, with
a smile.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Faith,''  (<font color='red'><b>lord</b></font>)</div>says my lord, <div class="bookquote">``if I tell Sir George Warrington that he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) seems to
me a very harmless, quiet gentleman, and that `tis a great relief to me
to talk to him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) amidst these loud politicians; these lawyers with their
perpetual noise about Greece and Rome; these Virginian squires who are
for ever professing their loyalty and respect, whilst they are shaking
their fists in my face--I hope nobody overhears us,''  (<font color='red'><b>lord</b></font>)</div>says my lord, with
an arch smile, <div class="bookquote">``and nobody will carry my opinions home.''

 (<font color='red'><b>lord nobody</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) lordship's ill opinion having been removed by a better knowledge of
me, our acquaintance daily grew more intimate; and, especially between
the ladies of his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) family and my own, a close friendship arose--between
them and my wife at least. Hal's wife, received kindly at the little
provincial court, as all ladies were, made herself by no means popular
there by the hot and eager political tone which she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) adopted. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
assailed all the Government measures with indiscriminating acrimony.
Were they lenient? She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) said the perfidious British Government was only
preparing a snare, and biding its time until it could forge heavier
chains for unhappy America. Were they angry? Why did not every American
citizen rise, assert his (<font color='blue'><b>citizen</b></font>) rights as a freeman, and serve every British
governor, officer, soldier, as they had treated the East India Company's
tea? My mother, on the other hand, was pleased to express her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) opinions
with equal frankness, and, indeed, to press her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) advice upon his (<font color='blue'><b>citizen</b></font>)
Excellency with a volubility which may have fatigued that representative
of the Sovereign. Call out the militia; send for fresh troops from New
York, from home, from anywhere; lock up the Capitol! -LRB-this advice
was followed, it must be owned-RRB- and send every one of the ringleaders
amongst those wicked burgesses to prison! was Madam Esmond's daily
counsel to the Governor by word and letter. And if not only the
burgesses, but the burgesses' wives could have been led off to
punishment and captivity, I think this Brutus of a woman would scarce
have appealed against the sentence.




<p/>CHAPTER LXXXVII. The Last of God Save the King


<p/>What perverse law of Fate is it that ever places me in a minority?
Should a law be proposed to hand over this realm to the Pretender of
Rome, or the Grand Turk, and submit it to the new sovereign's religion,
it might pass, as I should certainly be voting against it. At home in
Virginia, I found myself disagreeing with everybody as usual. By the
Patriots I was voted -LRB-as indeed I professed myself to be-RRB- a Tory; by the
Tories I was presently declared to be a dangerous Republican. The time
was utterly out of joint. O cursed spite! Ere I had been a year in
Virginia, how I wished myself back by the banks of the Waveney! But the
aspect of affairs was so troublous, that I could not leave my mother,
a lone lady, to face possible war and disaster, nor would she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) quit the
country at such a juncture, nor should a man of spirit leave it. At his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
Excellency's table, and over his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) Excellency's plentiful claret, that
point was agreed on by numbers of the well-affected, that vow was vowed
over countless brimming bumpers. No: it was statue signum, signifer!
We Cavaliers would all rally round it; and at these times, our Governor
talked like the bravest of the brave.

<p/>Now, I will say, of all my Virginian acquaintance, Madam Esmond was the
most consistent. Our gentlefolks had come in numbers to Williamsburg;
and a great number of them proposed to treat her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) Excellency, the
Governor's lady, to a ball, when the news reached us of the Boston Port
Bill. Straightway the House of Burgesses adopts an indignant protest
against this measure of the British Parliament, and decrees a solemn day
of fast and humiliation throughout the country, and of solemn prayer to
Heaven to avert the calamity of Civil War. Meanwhile, the invitation to
my Lady Dunmore having been already given and accepted, the gentlemen
agreed that their ball should take place on the appointed evening, and
then sackcloth and ashes should be assumed some days afterwards.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A ball!''  (<font color='red'><b>Madam Esmond/Madam Esmond Warrington/Madam Warrington</b></font>)</div>says Madam Esmond. <div class="bookquote">``I go to a ball which is given by a set of
rebels who are going publicly to insult his (<font color='blue'><b>Virginian</b></font>) Majesty a week afterwards!
I will die sooner!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) wrote to the gentlemen who were stewards for
the occasion to say, that viewing the dangerous state of the country,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>), for her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) part, could not think of attending a ball.

<p/>What was her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) surprise then, the next time she (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) went abroad in her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) chair,
to be cheered by a hundred persons, white and black, and shouts of
<div class="bookquote">``Huzzah, Madam!''  (<font color='red'><b>a persons</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Heaven bless your ladyship!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>They evidently thought
her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) patriotism had caused her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) determination not to go to the ball.

<p/>Madam, that there should be no mistake, puts her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) head out of the chair,
and cries out <div class="bookquote">``God save the King''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>as loud as she (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) can. The people cried
<div class="bookquote">``God save the King,''  (<font color='red'><b>The people</b></font>)</div>too. Everybody cried <div class="bookquote">``God save the King''  (<font color='red'><b>Everybody</b></font>)</div>in those
days. On the night of that entertainment, my poor Harry, as a Burgess
of the House, and one of the givers of the feast, donned his (<font color='blue'><b>Burgess</b></font>) uniform red
coat of Wolfe's -LRB-which he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgess</b></font>) so soon was to exchange for another colour-RRB-,
and went off with Madam Fanny to the ball. My Lady Warrington and her (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>)
humble servant, as being strangers in the country, and English people as
it were, were permitted by Madam to attend the assembly from which she (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>)
of course absented herself. I had the honour to dance a country-dance
with the lady of Mount Vernon, whom I found a most lively, pretty, and
amiable partner; but am bound to say that my wife's praises of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) were
received with a very grim acceptance by my mother, when Lady Warrington
came to recount the events of the evening. Could not Sir George
Warrington have danced with my Lady Dunmore or her (<font color='blue'><b>Dunmore</b></font>) daughters, or with
anybody but Mrs. Washington; to be sure the Colonel thought so well of
himself and his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) wife, that no doubt he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) considered her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) the grandest lady
in the room; and she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) who remembered him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) a road-surveyor at a guinea a
day! Well, indeed! there was no measuring the pride of these provincial
upstarts, and as for this gentleman, my Lord Dunmore's partiality for
him (<font color='blue'><b>Dunmore</b></font>) had evidently turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Dunmore</b></font>) head. I do not know about Mr. Washington's
pride, I know that my good mother never could be got to love him (<font color='blue'><b>Washington</b></font>) or
anything that was his (<font color='blue'><b>Washington</b></font>).

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was no better pleased with him (<font color='blue'><b>Washington</b></font>) for going to the ball, than with his (<font color='blue'><b>Washington</b></font>)
conduct three days afterwards, when the day of fast and humiliation
was appointed, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Washington</b></font>) attended the service which our new clergyman
performed. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) invited Mr. Belman to dinner that day, and sundry
colonial authorities. The clergyman excused himself. Madam Esmond tossed
up her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) head, and said he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) might do as he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) liked. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) made a parade of a
dinner; she (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) lighted her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) house up at night, when all the rest of the city
was in darkness and gloom; she (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) begged Mr. Hardy, one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hardy</b></font>) Excellency's
aides-de-camp, to sing <div class="bookquote">``God save the King,''  (<font color='red'><b>Excellency aides-de-camp</b></font>)</div>to which the people in
the street outside listened, thinking that it might be a part of some
religious service which Madam was celebrating; but then she (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) called
for <div class="bookquote">``Britons, strike home!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>which the simple young gentleman just from
Europe began to perform, when a great yell arose in the street, and
a large stone, flung from some rebellious hand, plumped into the
punch-bowl before me, and scattered it and its contents about our
dining-room.

<p/>My mother went to the window nothing daunted. I can see her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) rigid little
figure now, as she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) stands with a tossed-up head, outstretched frilled
arms, and the twinkling stars for a background, and sings in chorus,
<div class="bookquote">``Britons, strike home! strike home!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>The crowd in front of the palings
shout and roar, <div class="bookquote">``Silence! for shame! go back!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>but she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) will not go back,
not she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Fling more stones, if you dare!''  (<font color='red'><b>lady</b></font>)</div>says the brave little lady;
and more might have come, but some gentlemen issuing out of the Raley
Tavern interpose with the crowd. <div class="bookquote">``You mustn't insult a lady,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>says a
voice I think I know. <div class="bookquote">``Huzza, Colonel! Hurrah, Captain! God bless
your honour!''  (<font color='red'><b>the people</b></font>)</div>say the people in the street. And thus the enemies are
pacified.

<p/>My mother, protesting that the whole disturbance was over, would have
had Mr. Hardy sing another song, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Hardy</b></font>) gave a sickly grin, and said,
<div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) really did not like to sing to such accompaniments,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and the
concert for that evening was ended; though I am bound to say that some
scoundrels returned at night, frightened my poor wife almost out of
wits, and broke every single window in the front of our tenement.
<div class="bookquote">``Britons, strike home!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was a little too much; Madam should have
contented herself with <div class="bookquote">``God save the King.''  (<font color='red'><b>royal</b></font>)</div>Militia was drilled,
bullets were cast, supplies of ammunition got ready, cunning plans for
disappointing the royal ordinances devised and carried out; but, to be
sure, <div class="bookquote">``God save the King''  (<font color='red'><b>royal</b></font>)</div>was the cry everywhere, and in reply to my
objections to the gentlemen-patriots, <div class="bookquote">``Why, you are scheming for a
separation; you are bringing down upon you the inevitable wrath of the
greatest power in the world!'' (<font color='red'><b>royal</b></font>)</div>--the answer to me always was, <div class="bookquote">``We mean no
separation at all; we yield to no men in loyalty; we glory in the name
of Britons,''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>and so forth, and so forth. The powder-barrels were heaped
in the cellar, the train was laid, but Mr. Fawkes was persistent in his (<font color='blue'><b>Fawkes</b></font>)
dutiful petitions to King and Parliament and meant no harm, not he (<font color='blue'><b>Fawkes</b></font>)!
`Tis true when I spoke of the power of our country, I imagined she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>)
would exert it; that she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) would not expect to overcome three millions
of fellow-Britons on their own soil with a few battalions, a half-dozen
generals from Bond Street, and a few thousand bravos hired out of
Germany. As if we wanted to insult the thirteen colonies as well as to
subdue them, we must set upon them these hordes of Hessians, and the
murderers out of the Indian wigwams. Was our great quarrel not to be
fought without tali auxilio and istis defensoribus? Ah! `tis easy, now
we are worsted, to look over the map of the great empire wrested from
us, and show how we ought not to have lost it. Long Island ought to
have exterminated Washington's army; he (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) ought never to have come out of
Valley Forge except as a prisoner. The South was ours after the battle
of Camden, but for the inconceivable meddling of the Commander-in-Chief
at New York, who paralysed the exertions of the only capable British
General who appeared during the war, and sent him (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) into that miserable
cul-de-sac at York Town, whence he (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) could only issue defeated and a
prisoner. Oh, for a week more! a day more, an hour more of darkness
or light! In reading over our American campaigns from their unhappy
commencement to their inglorious end, now that we are able to see the
enemy's movements and conditions as well as our own, I fancy we can see
how an advance, a march, might have put enemies into our power who had
no means to withstand it, and changed the entire issue of the struggle.
But it was ordained by Heaven, and for the good, as we can now have no
doubt, of both empires, that the great Western Republic should separate
from us: and the gallant soldiers who fought on her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) side, their
indomitable and heroic Chief above all, had the glory of facing and
overcoming, not only veteran soldiers amply provided and inured to war,
but wretchedness, cold, hunger, dissensions, treason within their own
camp, where all must have gone to rack, but for the pure unquenchable
flame of patriotism that was for ever burning in the bosom of the
heroic leader. What a constancy, what a magnanimity, what a surprising
persistence against fortune! Washington before the enemy was no better
nor braver than hundreds that fought with him (<font color='blue'><b>leader</b></font>) or against him (<font color='blue'><b>leader</b></font>) -LRB-who has
not heard the repeated sneers against <div class="bookquote">``Fabius''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>in which his (<font color='blue'><b>leader</b></font>) factious
captains were accustomed to indulge?-RRB-, but Washington the Chief of a
nation in arms, doing battle with distracted parties; calm in the midst
of conspiracy; serene against the open foe before him (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) and the darker
enemies at his (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) back; Washington inspiring order and spirit into troops
hungry and in rags; stung by ingratitude, but betraying no anger, and
ever ready to forgive; in defeat invincible, magnanimous in conquest,
and never so sublime as on that day when he (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) laid down his (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) victorious
sword and sought his (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) noble retirement:--here indeed is a character to
admire and revere; a life without a stain, a fame without a flaw. Quando
invenies parem? In that more extensive work, which I have planned and
partly written on the subject of this great war, I hope I have done
justice to the character of its greatest leader. -LSB-And I trust that in
the opinions I have recorded regarding him (<font color='blue'><b>leader</b></font>), I have shown that I also
can be just and magnanimous towards those who view me personally with
no favour. For my brother Hal being at Mount Vernon, and always eager to
bring me and his (<font color='blue'><b>Vernon</b></font>) beloved Chief on good terms, showed his (<font color='blue'><b>Vernon</b></font>) Excellency some
of the early sheets of my History. General Washington -LRB-who read but
few books, and had not the slightest pretensions to literary taste-RRB-
remarked, <div class="bookquote">``If you will have my opinion, my dear General, I think Sir
George's projected work, from the specimen I have of it, is certain
to offend both parties.'' (<font color='red'><b>General</b></font>)</div>--G. E. W.-RSB-. And this from the sheer force
of respect which his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) eminent virtues extorted. With the young Mr.
Washington of my own early days I had not the honour to enjoy much
sympathy: though my brother, whose character is much more frank and
affectionate than mine, was always his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) fast friend in early times, when
they were equals, as in latter days when the General, as I do own and
think, was all mankind's superior.

<p/>I have mentioned that contrariety in my disposition, and, perhaps, in my
brother's, which somehow placed us on wrong sides in the quarrel which
ensued, and which from this time forth raged for five years, until the
mother country was fain to acknowledge her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) defeat. Harry should have
been the Tory, and I the Whig. Theoretically my opinions were very
much more liberal than those of my brother, who, especially after
his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) marriage, became what our Indian nabobs call a Bahadoor--a person
ceremonious, stately, and exacting respect. When my Lord Dunmore, for
instance, talked about liberating the negroes, so as to induce them to
join the King's standard, Hal was for hanging the Governor and the Black
Guards -LRB-as he (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>) called them-RRB- whom his (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>) Excellency had crimped. <div class="bookquote">``If you,
gentlemen are fighting for freedom,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>says I, <div class="bookquote">``sure the negroes may
fight, too.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>On which Harry roars out, shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) fist, <div class="bookquote">``Infernal
villains, if I meet any of `em, they shall die by this hand!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>And
my mother agreed that this idea of a negro insurrection was the most
abominable and parricidal notion which had ever sprung up in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) unhappy
country. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) at least was more consistent than brother Hal. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) would
have black and white obedient to the powers that be: whereas Hal only
could admit that freedom was the right of the latter colour.

<p/>As a proof of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) argument, Madam Esmond and Harry too would point to
an instance in our own family in the person of Mr. Gumbo. Having got his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>)
freedom from me, as a reward for his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) admirable love and fidelity to me
when times were hard, Gumbo, on his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) return to Virginia, was scarce a
welcome guest in his (<font color='blue'><b>guest</b></font>) old quarters, amongst my mother's servants. He (<font color='blue'><b>guest</b></font>) was
free, and they were not: he (<font color='blue'><b>guest</b></font>) was, as it were, a centre of insurrection.
He (<font color='blue'><b>guest</b></font>) gave himself no small airs of protection and consequence amongst
them; bragging of his (<font color='blue'><b>guest</b></font>) friends in Europe -LRB-<div class="bookquote">``at home,''  (<font color='red'><b>friends</b></font>)</div>as he (<font color='blue'><b>guest</b></font>) called it-RRB-,
and his (<font color='blue'><b>guest</b></font>) doings there; and for a while bringing the household round about
him (<font color='blue'><b>guest</b></font>) to listen to him (<font color='blue'><b>guest</b></font>) and admire him (<font color='blue'><b>guest</b></font>), like the monkey who had seen the
world. Now, Sady, Hal's boy, who went to America of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sady</b></font>) own desire,
was not free. Hence jealousies between him (<font color='blue'><b>Sady</b></font>) and Mr. Gum; and battles,
in which they both practised the noble art of boxing and butting, which
they had learned at Marybone Gardens and Hockley-in-the-Hole. Nor was
Sady the only jealous person: almost all my mother's servants hated
Signor Gumbo for the airs which he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) gave himself; and I am sorry to
say, that our faithful Molly, his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) wife, was as jealous as his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) old
fellow-servants. The blacks could not pardon her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) for having demeaned
herself so far as to marry one of their kind. She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) met with no respect,
could exercise no authority, came to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) mistress with ceaseless
complaints of the idleness, knavery, lies, stealing of the black people;
and finally with a story of jealousy against a certain Dinah, or Diana,
who, I heartily trust, was as innocent as her (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) namesake the moonlight
visitant of Endymion. Now, on the article of morality Madam Esmond was
a very Draconess; and a person accused was a person guilty. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) made
charges against Mr. Gumbo to which he (<font color='blue'><b>Gumbo</b></font>) replied with asperity. Forgetting
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gumbo</b></font>) was a free gentleman, my mother now ordered Gumbo to be whipped,
on which Molly flew at her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) ladyship, all her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) wrath at her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) husband's
infidelity vanishing at the idea of the indignity put upon him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>); there
was a rebellion in our house at Castlewood. A quarrel took place between
me and my mother, as I took my man's side. Hal and Fanny sided with her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>),
on the contrary; and in so far the difference did good, as it brought
about some little intimacy between Madam and her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) younger children.
This little difference was speedily healed; but it was clear that
the Standard of Insurrection must be removed out of our house; and we
determined that Mr. Gumbo and his (<font color='blue'><b>Gumbo</b></font>) lady should return to Europe.

<p/>My wife and I would willingly have gone with them, God wot, for our
boy sickened and lost his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) strength, and caught the fever in our swampy
country; but at this time she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was expecting to lie in -LRB-of our son
Henry-RRB-, and she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) knew, too, that I had promised to stay in Virginia. It
was agreed that we should send the two back; but when I offered Theo to
go, she (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) said her (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) place was with her (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) husband;--her (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) father and Hetty at
home would take care of our children; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) scarce would allow me to
see a tear in her (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) eyes whilst she (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) was making her (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) preparations for the
departure of her (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) little ones. Dost thou remember the time, madam, and
the silence round the worktables, as the piles of little shirts are made
ready for the voyage? and the stealthy visits to the children's chambers
whilst they are asleep and yet with you? and the terrible time of
parting, as our barge with the servants and children rows to the ship,
and you stand on the shore? Had the Prince of Wales been going on that
voyage, he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) could not have been better provided. Where, sirrah, is the
Tompion watch your grandmother gave you? and how did you survive the
boxes of cakes which the good lady stowed away in your cabin?

<p/>The ship which took out my poor Theo's children, returned with the
Reverend Mr. Hagan and my Lady Maria on board, who meekly chose to
resign her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) rank, and was known in the colony -LRB-which was not to be a
colony very long-RRB- only as Mrs. Hagan. At the time when I was in favour
with my Lord Dunmore, a living falling vacant in Westmoreland county, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dunmore</b></font>)
gave it to our kinsman, who arrived in Virginia time enough to christen
our boy Henry, and to preach some sermons on the then gloomy state of
affairs, which Madam Esmond pronounced to be prodigious fine. I think my
Lady Maria won Madam's heart by insisting on going out of the room after
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``My father, your brother, was an earl, `tis true,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>says she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``but
you know your ladyship is a marquis's daughter, and I never can think of
taking precedence of you!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>So fond did Madam become of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) niece, that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) even allowed Hagan to read plays--my own humble compositions amongst
others--and was fairly forced to own that there was merit in the tragedy
of Pocahontas, which our parson delivered with uncommon energy and fire.

<p/>Hal and his (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>) wife came but rarely to Castlewood and Richmond when the
chaplain and his (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>) lady were with us. Fanny was very curt and rude with
Maria, used to giggle and laugh strangely in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) company, and repeatedly
remind her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) age, to our mother's astonishment, who would
often ask, was there any cause of quarrel between her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) niece and her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>)
daughter-in-law? I kept my own counsel on these occasions, and was often
not a little touched by the meekness with which the elder lady bore her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
persecutions. Fanny loved to torture her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) husband's presence
-LRB-who, poor fellow, was also in happy ignorance about his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) wife's early
history-RRB-, and the other bore her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) agony, wincing as little as might be. I
sometimes would remonstrate with Madam Harry, and ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was she (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) a Red
Indian, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) tortured her (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) victims so? <div class="bookquote">``Have not I had torture
enough in my time?''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>says the young lady, and looked as though she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was
determined to pay back the injuries inflicted on her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>says I, <div class="bookquote">``you were bred in our wigwam, and I don't remember
anything but kindness!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Kindness!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>cries she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``No slave was ever treated as I was. The blows
which wound most, often are those which never are aimed. The people who
hate us are not those we have injured.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I thought of little Fanny in our early days, silent, smiling, willing to
run and do all our biddings for us, and I grieved for my poor brother,
who had taken this sly creature into his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) bosom.




<p/>CHAPTER LXXXVIII. Yankee Doodle comes to Town


<p/>One of the uses to which we put America in the days of our British
dominion was to make it a refuge for our sinners. Besides convicts and
assigned servants whom we transported to our colonies, we discharged
on their shores scapegraces and younger sons, for whom dissipation,
despair, and bailiffs made the old country uninhabitable. And as Mr.
Cook, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Cook</b></font>) voyages, made his (<font color='blue'><b>Cook</b></font>) newly discovered islanders presents of
English animals -LRB-and other specimens of European civilisation-RRB-, we used
to take care to send samples of our black sheep over to the colonies,
there to browse as best they might, and propagate their precious breed.
I myself was perhaps a little guilty in this matter, in busying
myself to find a living in America for the worthy Hagan, husband of my
kinswoman,--at least was guilty in so far as this, that as we could get
him (<font color='blue'><b>Hagan</b></font>) no employment in England, we were glad to ship him (<font color='blue'><b>Hagan</b></font>) to Virginia, and
give him (<font color='blue'><b>Hagan</b></font>) a colonial pulpit-cushion to thump. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hagan</b></font>) demeaned himself there
as a brave honest gentleman, to be sure; he (<font color='blue'><b>Hagan</b></font>) did his (<font color='blue'><b>Hagan</b></font>) duty thoroughly by
his (<font color='blue'><b>Hagan</b></font>) congregation, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Hagan</b></font>) king too; and in so far did credit to my
small patronage. Madam Theo used to urge this when I confided to her (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) my
scruples of conscience on this subject, and show, as her (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) custom was and
is, that my conduct in this, as in all other matters, was dictated by
the highest principle of morality and honour. But would I have given
Hagan our living at home, and selected him (<font color='blue'><b>Hagan</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Hagan</b></font>) wife to minister
to our parish? I fear not. I never had a doubt of our cousin's sincere
repentance; but I think I was secretly glad when she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) went to work it out
in the wilderness. And I say this, acknowledging my pride and my error.
Twice, when I wanted them most, this kind Maria aided me with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>)
sympathy and friendship. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) bore her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) own distresses courageously, and
soothed those of others with admirable affection and devotion. And yet
I, and some of mine -LRB-not Theo-RRB-, would look down upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>). Oh, for shame,
for shame on our pride!

<p/>My poor Lady Maria was not the only one of our family who was to be
sent out of the way to American wildernesses. Having borrowed, stolen,
cheated at home, until he (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) could cheat, borrow, and steal no more, the
Honourable William Esmond, Esquire, was accommodated with a place at New
York; and his (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) noble brother and royal master heartily desired that they
might see him (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) no more. When the troubles began, we heard of the fellow
and his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) doings in his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) new habitation. Lies and mischief were his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)
avant-couriers wherever he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) travelled. My Lord Dunmore informed me that
Mr. Will declared publicly, that our estate of Castlewood was only ours
during his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) brother's pleasure; that his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) father, out of consideration for
Madam Esmond, his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) lordship's half-sister, had given her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) the place for
life, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>), William, was in negotiation with his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) brother, the
present Lord Castlewood, for the purchase of the reversion of the
estate! We had the deed of gift in our strongroom at Castlewood, and it
was furthermore registered in due form at Williamsburg; so that we were
easy on that score. But the intention was everything; and Hal and
I promised, as soon as ever we met Mr. William, to get from him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) a
confirmation of this pretty story. What Madam Esmond's feelings and
expressions were when she (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) heard it, I need scarcely here particularise.
<div class="bookquote">``What! my father, the Marquis of Esmond, was a liar, and I am a cheat,
am I?''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>cries my mother. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>liar</b></font>) will take my son's property at my death,
will he (<font color='blue'><b>liar</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) was for writing, not only to Lord Castlewood in
England, but to his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) Majesty himself at St. James's, and was only
prevented by my assurance that Mr. Will's lies were notorious amongst
all his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) acquaintance, and that we could not expect, in our own case,
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) should be so inconsistent as to tell the truth. We heard of him (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>)
presently as one of the loudest amongst the Loyalists in New York, as
Captain, and presently Major of a corps of volunteers who were sending
their addresses to the well-disposed in all the other colonies, and
announcing their perfect readiness to die for the mother country.

<p/>We could not lie in a house without a whole window, and closing the
shutters of that unlucky mansion we had hired at Williamsburg, Madam
Esmond left our little capital, and my family returned to Richmond,
which also was deserted by the members of the -LRB-dissolved-RRB- Assembly.
Captain Hal and his (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>) wife returned pretty early to their plantation; and
I, not a little annoyed at the course which events were taking, divided
my time pretty much between my own family and that of our Governor, who
professed himself very eager to have my advice and company. There were
the strongest political differences, but as yet no actual personal
quarrel. Even after the dissolution of our House of Assembly -LRB-the
members of which adjourned to a tavern, and there held that famous
meeting where, I believe, the idea of a congress of all the colonies was
first proposed-RRB-, the gentlemen who were strongest in opposition remained
good friends with his (<font color='blue'><b>Governor</b></font>) Excellency, partook of his (<font color='blue'><b>Governor</b></font>) hospitality, and joined
him (<font color='blue'><b>Governor</b></font>) in excursions of pleasure. The session over, the gentry went home
and had meetings in their respective counties; and the Assemblies in
most of the other provinces having been also abruptly dissolved, it was
agreed everywhere that a general congress should be held. Philadelphia,
as the largest and most important city on our continent, was selected as
the place of meeting; and those celebrated conferences began, which were
but the angry preface of war. We were still at God save the King; we
were still presenting our humble petitions to the throne; but when I
went to visit my brother Harry at Fanny's Mount -LRB-his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) new plantation
lay not far from ours, but with Rappahannock between us, and towards
Mattaponey River-RRB-, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) rode out on business one morning, and I in the
afternoon happened to ride too, and was told by one of the grooms that
master was gone towards Willis's Ordinary; in which direction, thinking
no harm, I followed. And upon a clear place not far from Willis's, as I
advance out of the wood, I come on Captain Hal on horseback, with three-
or four-and-thirty countrymen round about him (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>), armed with every sort of
weapon, pike, scythe, fowling-piece, and musket; and the Captain, with
two or three likely young fellows as officers under him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>), putting the men
through their exercise. As I rode up a queer expression comes over Hal's
face. <div class="bookquote">``Present arms!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>says he (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>) -LRB-and the army tries to perform the salute
as well they could-RRB-. <div class="bookquote">``Captain Cade, this is my brother, Sir George
Warrington.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``As a relation of yours, Colonel,''  (<font color='red'><b>captain</b></font>)</div>says the individual addressed
as captain, <div class="bookquote">``the gentleman is welcome,''  (<font color='red'><b>captain</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) holds out a hand
accordingly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And--and a true friend to Virginia,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hal</b></font>)</div>says Hal, with a reddening face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, please God! gentlemen,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>say I, on which the regiment gives a
hearty huzzay for the Colonel and his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) brother. The drill over, the
officers, and the men too, were for adjourning to Willis's and taking
some refreshment, but Colonel Hal said he (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>) could not drink with them that
afternoon, and we trotted homewards together.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So, Hal, the cat's out of the bag!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>) gave me a hard look. <div class="bookquote">``I guess there's wilder cats in it. It must come
to this, George. I say, you mustn't tell Madam,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>) adds.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good God!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I cried, <div class="bookquote">``do you mean that with fellows such as those I
saw yonder, you and your friends are going to make fight against the
greatest nation and the best army in the world?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I guess we shall get an awful whipping,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hal</b></font>)</div>says Hal, <div class="bookquote">``and that's the
fact. But then, George,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hal</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>) added, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>) sweet kind smile, <div class="bookquote">``we are
young, and a whipping or two may do us good. Won't it do us good, Dolly,
you old slut?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>) gives a playful touch with his (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>) whip to an old dog
of all trades, that was running by him (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>).

<p/>I did not try to urge upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>) -LRB-I had done so in vain many times
previously-RRB- our British side of the question, the side which appears to
me to be the best. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>) was accustomed to put off my reasons by saying,
<div class="bookquote">``All mighty well, brother, you speak as an Englishman, and have cast in
your lot with your country, as I have with mine.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>To this argument I own
there is no answer, and all that remains for the disputants is to fight
the matter out, when the strongest is in the right. Which had the right
in the wars of the last century? The king or the parliament? The side
that was uppermost was the right, and on the whole much more humane
in their victory than the Cavaliers would have been had they won. Nay,
suppose we Tories had won the day in America; how frightful and bloody
that triumph would have been! What ropes and scaffolds one imagines,
what noble heads laid low! A strange feeling this, I own; I was on the
Loyalist side, and yet wanted the Whigs to win. My brother Hal, on the
other hand, who distinguished himself greatly with his (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>) regiment, never
allowed a word of disrespect against the enemy whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>) opposed. <div class="bookquote">``The
officers of the British army,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>) used to say, <div class="bookquote">``are gentlemen: at least,
I have not heard that they are very much changed since my time. There
may be scoundrels and ruffians amongst the enemy's troops; I dare say
we could find some such amongst our own. Our business is to beat his (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>)
Majesty's forces, not call them names;--any rascal can do that.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And from a name which Mr. Lee gave my brother, and many of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lee</b></font>) rough
horsemen did not understand, Harry was often called <div class="bookquote">``Chevaleer Baird''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>in
the Continental army. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was a knight, indeed, without fear and without
reproach.

<p/>As for the argument, <div class="bookquote">``What could such people as those you were drilling
do against the British army?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hal</b></font>)</div>Hal had as confident answer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They can beat them,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>says he (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``Mr. George, that's what they can do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Great heavens!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I cry, <div class="bookquote">``do you mean with your company of Wolfe's you
would hesitate to attack five hundred such?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``With my company of the 67th, I would go anywhere. And, agreed with you,
that at this present moment I know more of soldiering than they;--but
place me on that open ground where you found us, armed as you please,
and half a dozen of my friends, with rifles, in the woods round
about me; which would get the better? You know best, Mr. Braddock's
aide-de-camp!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>There was no arguing with such a determination as this. <div class="bookquote">``Thou knowest my
way of thinking, Hal,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said; <div class="bookquote">``and having surprised you at your work, I
must tell my lord what I have seen.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell him (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>), of course. You have seen our county militia exercising. You
will see as much in every colony from here to the Saint Lawrence or
Georgia. As I am an old soldier, they have elected me colonel. What more
natural? Come, brother, let us trot on; dinner will be ready, and Mrs.
Fan does not like me to keep it waiting.''  (<font color='red'><b>Virginian</b></font>)</div>And so we made for his (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>) house,
which was open like all the houses of our Virginian gentlemen, and where
not only every friend and neighbour, but every stranger and traveller,
was sure to find a welcome.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So, Mrs. Fan,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said, <div class="bookquote">``I have found out what game my brother has been
playing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I trust the Colonel will have plenty of sport ere long,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>says she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), with
a toss of her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) head.

<p/>My wife thought Harry had been hunting, and I did not care to undeceive
her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), though what I had seen and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had told me, made me naturally very
anxious.




<p/>CHAPTER LXXXIX. A Colonel without a Regiment


<p/>When my visit to my brother was concluded, and my wife and young child
had returned to our maternal house at Richmond, I made it my business to
go over to our Governor, then at his (<font color='blue'><b>Governor</b></font>) country house, near Williamsburg,
and confer with him (<font color='blue'><b>Governor</b></font>) regarding these open preparations for war, which
were being made not only in our own province, but in every one of the
colonies as far as we could learn. Gentlemen, with whose names history
has since made all the world familiar, were appointed from Virginia as
Delegates to the General Congress about to be held in Philadelphia. In
Massachusetts the people and the Royal troops were facing each other
almost in open hostility: in Maryland and Pennsylvania we flattered
ourselves that a much more loyal spirit was prevalent: in the Carolinas
and Georgia the mother country could reckon upon staunch adherents, and
a great majority of the inhabitants: and it never was to be supposed
that our own Virginia would forgo its ancient loyalty. We had but few
troops in the province, but its gentry were proud of their descent from
the Cavaliers of the old times: and round about our Governor were swarms
of loud and confident Loyalists who were only eager for the moment when
they might draw the sword, and scatter the rascally rebels before them.
Of course, in these meetings I was forced to hear many a hard word
against my poor Harry. His (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wife, all agreed -LRB-and not without good
reason, perhaps-RRB-, had led him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) to adopt these extreme anti-British
opinions which he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had of late declared; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was infatuated by his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
attachment to the gentleman of Mount Vernon, it was farther said, whose
opinions my brother always followed, and who, day by day, was committing
himself farther in the dreadful and desperate course of resistance.
<div class="bookquote">``This is your friend,''  (<font color='red'><b>the people</b></font>)</div>the people about his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) Excellency said, <div class="bookquote">``this is
the man you favoured, who has had your special confidence, and who has
repeatedly shared your hospitality!''  (<font color='red'><b>the people</b></font>)</div>It could not but be owned much of
this was true: though what some of our eager Loyalists called treachery
was indeed rather a proof of the longing desire Mr. Washington and other
gentlemen had, not to withdraw from their allegiance to the Crown, but
to remain faithful, and exhaust the very last chance of reconciliation,
before they risked the other terrible alternative of revolt and
separation. Let traitors arm, and villains draw the parricidal sword! We
at least would remain faithful; the unconquerable power of England would
be exerted, and the misguided and ungrateful provinces punished and
brought back to their obedience. With what cheers we drank his (<font color='blue'><b>Washington</b></font>) Majesty's
health after our banquets! We would die in defence of his (<font color='blue'><b>Washington</b></font>) rights; we
would have a Prince of his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) Royal house to come and govern his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) ancient
dominions! In consideration of my own and my excellent mother's loyalty,
my brother's benighted conduct should be forgiven. Was it yet too late
to secure him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) by offering him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) a good command? Would I not intercede
with him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>), who, it was known, had a great influence over him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)? In our
Williamsburg councils we were alternately in every state of exaltation
and triumph, of hope, of fury against the rebels, of anxious expectancy
of home succour, of doubt, distrust, and gloom.

<p/>I promised to intercede with my brother; and wrote to him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>), I own, with
but little hope of success, repeating, and trying to strengthen the
arguments which I had many a time used in our conversations. My mother,
too, used her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) authority; but from this, I own, I expected little
advantage. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) assailed him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>), as her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) habit was, with such texts of
Scripture as she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) thought bore out her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) own opinion, and threatened
punishment to him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) menaced him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) with the penalties which must fall
upon those who were disobedient to the powers that be. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) pointed to
his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) elder brother's example; and hinted, I fear, at his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) subjection to
his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) wife, the very worst argument she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) could use in such a controversy.
She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) did not show me her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) own letter to him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>); possibly she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) knew I might
find fault with the energy of some of the expressions she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) thought proper
to employ; but she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) showed me his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) answer, from which I gathered what the
style and tenor of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) argument had been. And if Madam Esmond brought
Scripture to her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) aid, Mr. Hal, to my surprise, brought scores of texts
to bear upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) in reply, and addressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) in a very neat, temperate,
and even elegant composition, which I thought his (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>) wife herself was
scarcely capable of penning. Indeed, I found he (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>) had enlisted the
services of Mr. Belman, the New Richmond clergyman, who had taken up
strong opinions on the Whig side, and who preached and printed sermons
against Hagan -LRB-who, as I have said, was of our faction-RRB-, in which I fear
Belman had the best of the dispute.

<p/>My exhortations to Hal had no more success than our mother's. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>) did
not answer my letters. Being still farther pressed by the friends of the
Government, I wrote over most imprudently to say I would visit him (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>) at
the end of the week at Fanny's Mount; but on arriving, I only found my
sister, who received me with perfect cordiality, but informed me that
Hal was gone into the country, ever so far towards the Blue Mountains
to look at some horses, and was to be away--she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) did not know how long he (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>)
was to be away!

<p/>I knew then there was no hope. <div class="bookquote">``My dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said, <div class="bookquote">``as far as I can judge
from the signs of the times, the train that has been laid these years
must have a match put to it before long. Harry is riding away. God knows
to what end.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The Lord prosper the righteous cause, Sir George,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>says she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Amen, with all my heart. You and he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) speak as Americans; I as an
Englishman. Tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) from me, that when anything in the course of nature
shall happen to our mother, I have enough for me and mine in England,
and shall resign all our land here in Virginia to him (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't mean that, George?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) cries, with brightening eyes. <div class="bookquote">``Well,
to be sure, it is but right and fair,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) presently added. <div class="bookquote">``Why should
you, who are the eldest but by an hour, have everything? a palace and
lands in England--the plantation here--the title--and children--and
my poor Harry none? But `tis generous of you all the same--leastways
handsome and proper, and I didn't expect it of you; and you don't take
after your mother in this, Sir George, that you don't, nohow. Give my
love to sister Theo!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) offers me a cheek to kiss, ere I ride away
from her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) door. With such a woman as Fanny to guide him (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>), how could I hope
to make a convert of my brother?

<p/>Having met with this poor success in my enterprise, I rode back to our
Governor, with whom I agreed that it was time to arm in earnest, and
prepare ourselves against the shock that certainly was at hand. He (<font color='blue'><b>Governor</b></font>) and
his (<font color='blue'><b>Governor</b></font>) whole Court of Officials were not a little agitated and excited;
needlessly savage, I thought, in their abuse of the wicked Whigs, and
loud in their shouts of Old England for ever; but they were all eager
for the day when the contending parties could meet hand to hand, and
they could have an opportunity of riding those wicked Whigs down. And I
left my lord, having received the thanks of his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) Excellency in Council,
and engaged to do my best endeavours to raise a body of men in defence
of the Crown. Hence the corps, called afterwards the Westmoreland
Defenders, had its rise, of which I had the honour to be appointed
Colonel, and which I was to command when it appeared in the field. And
that fortunate event must straightway take place, so soon as the county
knew that a gentleman of my station and name would take the command of
the force. The announcement was duly made in the Government Gazette, and
we filled in our officers readily enough; but the recruits, it must
be owned, were slow to come in, and quick to disappear. Nevertheless,
friend Hagan eagerly came forward to offer himself as chaplain. Madam
Esmond gave us our colours, and progressed about the country engaging
volunteers; but the most eager recruiter of all was my good old tutor,
little Mr. Dempster, who had been out as a boy on the Jacobite side in
Scotland, and who went specially into the Carolinas, among the children
of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) banished old comrades, who had worn the white cockade of Prince
Charles, and who most of all showed themselves in this contest still
loyal to the Crown.

<p/>Hal's expedition in search of horses led him (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>) not only so far as the Blue
Mountains in our colony, but thence on a long journey to Annapolis
and Baltimore; and from Baltimore to Philadelphia, to be sure; where
a second General Congress was now sitting, attended by our Virginian
gentlemen of the last year. Meanwhile, all the almanacs tell what had
happened. Lexington had happened, and the first shots were fired in the
war which was to end in the independence of our native country. We still
protested of our loyalty to his (<font color='blue'><b>Virginian</b></font>) Majesty; but we stated our determination
to die or be free; and some twenty thousand of our loyal petitioners
assembled round about Boston with arms in their hands and cannon, to
which they had helped themselves out of the Government stores. Mr.
Arnold had begun that career which was to end so brilliantly, by the
daring and burglarious capture of two forts, of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>) forced the
doors. Three generals from Bond Street, with a large reinforcement,
were on their way to help Mr. Gage out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) ugly position at Boston.
Presently the armies were actually engaged; and our British generals
commenced their career of conquest and pacification in the colonies by
the glorious blunder of Breed's Hill. Here they fortified themselves,
feeling themselves not strong enough for the moment to win any more
glorious victories over the rebels; and the two armies lay watching
each other whilst Congress was deliberating at Philadelphia who should
command the forces of the confederated colonies.

<p/>We all know on whom the most fortunate choice of the nation fell. Of the
Virginian regiment which marched to join the new General-in-Chief, one
was commanded by Henry Esmond Warrington, Esq., late a Captain in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) Majesty's service; and by his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) side rode his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) little wife, of whose
bravery we often subsequently heard. I was glad, for one, that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had
quitted Virginia; for, had she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) remained after her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) husband's departure,
our mother would infallibly have gone over to give her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) battle; and I was
thankful, at least, that that terrific incident of civil war was spared
to our family and history.

<p/>The rush of our farmers and country-folk was almost all directed towards
the new northern army; and our people were not a little flattered at
the selection of a Virginian gentleman for the principal command. With
a thrill of wrath and fury the provinces heard of the blood drawn
at Lexington; and men yelled denunciations against the cruelty and
wantonness of the bloody British invader. The invader was but doing his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
duty, and was met and resisted by men in arms, who wished to prevent him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
from helping himself to his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) own; but people do not stay to weigh their
words when they mean to be angry; the colonists had taken their side;
and, with what I own to be a natural spirit and ardour, were determined
to have a trial of strength with the braggart domineering mother
country. Breed's Hill became a mountain, as it were, which all men of
the American Continent might behold, with Liberty, Victory, Glory, on
its flaming summit. These dreaded troops could be withstood, then, by
farmers and ploughmen. These famous officers could be outgeneralled by
doctors, lawyers, and civilians! Granted that Britons could conquer
all the world;--here were their children who could match and conquer
Britons! Indeed, I don't know which of the two deserves the palm, either
for bravery or vainglory. We are in the habit of laughing at our French
neighbours for boasting, gasconading, and so forth; but for a steady
self-esteem and indomitable confidence in our own courage, greatness,
magnanimity;--who can compare with Britons, except their children across
the Atlantic?

<p/>The people round about us took the people's side for the most part
in the struggle, and, truth to say, Sir George Warrington found his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>)
regiment of Westmoreland Defenders but very thinly manned at the
commencement, and woefully diminished in numbers presently, not only
after the news of battle from the north, but in consequence of the
behaviour of my Lord our Governor, whose conduct enraged no one more
than his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) own immediate partisans, and the loyal adherents of the Crown
throughout the colony. That he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) would plant the King's standard, and
summon all loyal gentlemen to rally round it, had been a measure agreed
in countless meetings, and applauded over thousands of bumpers. I have a
pretty good memory, and could mention the name of many a gentleman, now
a smug officer of the United States Government, whom I have heard hiccup
out a prayer that he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) might be allowed to perish under the folds of his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>)
country's flag; or roar a challenge to the bloody traitors absent with
the rebel army. But let bygones be bygones. This, however, is matter of
public history, that his (<font color='blue'><b>rebel</b></font>) lordship, our Governor, a peer of Scotland, the
Sovereign's representative in his (<font color='blue'><b>rebel</b></font>) Old Dominion, who so loudly invited
all the lieges to join the King's standard, was the first to put it in
his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) pocket, and fly to his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) ships out of reach of danger. He (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) would not
leave them, save as a pirate at midnight to burn and destroy. Meanwhile,
we loyal gentry remained on shore, committed to our cause, and only
subject to greater danger in consequence of the weakness and cruelty of
him (<font color='blue'><b>gentry</b></font>) who ought to have been our leader. It was the beginning of June, our
orchards and gardens were all blooming with plenty and summer; a week
before I had been over at Williamsburg, exchanging compliments with his (<font color='blue'><b>gentry</b></font>)
Excellency, devising plans for future movements by which we should be
able to make good head against rebellion, shaking hands heartily at
parting, and vincere aut mori the very last words upon all our lips. Our
little family was gathered at Richmond, talking over, as we did daily,
the prospect of affairs in the north, the quarrels between our own
Assembly and his (<font color='blue'><b>gentry</b></font>) Excellency, by whom they had been afresh convened, when
our ghostly Hagan rushes into our parlour, and asks, <div class="bookquote">``Have we heard the
news of the Governor?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hagan/Mr. Hagan</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Has he (<font color='blue'><b>Governor</b></font>) dissolved the Assembly again, and put that scoundrel Patrick
Henry in irons?''  (<font color='red'><b>Madam Esmond/Madam Esmond Warrington/Madam Warrington</b></font>)</div>asks Madam Esmond.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No such thing! His (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) lordship with his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) lady and family have left their
palace privately at night. They are on board a man-of-war off York,
whence my lord has sent a despatch to the Assembly, begging them to
continue their sitting, and announcing that he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) himself had only quitted
his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) Government House out of fear of the fury of the people.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the shepherd</b></font>)</div><p/>What was to become of the sheep, now the shepherd had run away? No
entreaties could be more pathetic than those of the gentlemen of the
House of Assembly, who guaranteed their Governor security if he (<font color='blue'><b>Governor</b></font>) would
but land, and implored him (<font color='blue'><b>Governor</b></font>) to appear amongst them, if but to pass bills
and transact the necessary business. No: the man-of-war was his (<font color='blue'><b>Governor</b></font>) seat of
government, and my lord desired his (<font color='blue'><b>Governor</b></font>) House of Commons to wait upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Governor</b></font>)
there. This was erecting the King's standard with a vengeance. Our
Governor had left us; our Assembly perforce ruled in his (<font color='blue'><b>Governor</b></font>) stead; a rabble
of people followed the fugitive Viceroy on board his (<font color='blue'><b>Governor</b></font>) ships. A mob of
negroes deserted out of the plantations to join this other deserter. He (<font color='blue'><b>Governor</b></font>)
and his (<font color='blue'><b>Governor</b></font>) black allies landed here and there in darkness, and emulated the
most lawless of our opponents in their alacrity at seizing and burning.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Governor</b></font>) not only invited runaway negroes, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Governor</b></font>) sent an ambassador to
Indians with entreaties to join his (<font color='blue'><b>Governor</b></font>) standard. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Governor</b></font>) came on shore it
was to burn and destroy: when the people resisted, as at Norfolk and
Hampton, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hampton</b></font>) retreated and betook himself to his (<font color='blue'><b>Hampton</b></font>) ships again.

<p/>Even my mother, after that miserable flight of our chief, was scared
at the aspect of affairs, and doubted of the speedy putting down of
the rebellion. The arming of the negroes was, in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) opinion, the most
cowardly blow of all. The loyal gentry were ruined, and robbed, many of
them, of their only property. A score of our worst hands deserted from
Richmond and Castlewood, and fled to our courageous Governor's fleet;
not all of them, though some of them, were slain, and a couple hung by
the enemy for plunder and robbery perpetrated whilst with his (<font color='blue'><b>Governor</b></font>) lordship's
precious army. Because her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) property was wantonly injured, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Governor</b></font>)
Majesty's chief officer an imbecile, would Madam Esmond desert the
cause of Royalty and Honour? My good mother was never so prodigiously
dignified, and loudly and enthusiastically loyal, as after she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) heard of
our Governor's lamentable defection. The people round about her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), though
most of them of quite a different way of thinking, listened to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
speeches without unkindness. Her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) oddities were known far and wide
through our province; where, I am afraid, many of the wags amongst our
young men were accustomed to smoke her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), as the phrase then was, and draw
out her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) stories about the Marquis her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) father, about the splendour of
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) family, and so forth. But along with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) oddities, her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) charities and
kindness were remembered, and many a rebel, as she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) called them, had a
sneaking regard for the pompous little Tory lady.

<p/>As for the Colonel of the Westmoreland Defenders, though that
gentleman's command dwindled utterly away after the outrageous conduct
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) chief, yet I escaped from some very serious danger which might
have befallen me and mine in consequence of some disputes which I was
known to have had with my Lord Dunmore. Going on board his (<font color='blue'><b>Dunmore</b></font>) ship after
he (<font color='blue'><b>Dunmore</b></font>) had burned the stores at Hampton, and issued the proclamation calling
the negroes to his (<font color='blue'><b>Hampton</b></font>) standard, I made so free as to remonstrate with him (<font color='blue'><b>Hampton</b></font>)
in regard to both measures; I implored him (<font color='blue'><b>Hampton</b></font>) to return to Williamsburg,
where hundreds of us, thousands, I hoped, would be ready to defend him (<font color='blue'><b>Hampton</b></font>)
to the last extremity; and in my remonstrance used terms so free, or
rather, as I suspect, indicated my contempt for his (<font color='blue'><b>Hampton</b></font>) conduct so clearly
by my behaviour, that his (<font color='blue'><b>Hampton</b></font>) lordship flew into a rage, said I was a rebel
like all the rest of them, and ordered me under arrest there on board
his (<font color='blue'><b>Hampton</b></font>) own ship. In my quality of militia officer -LRB-since the breaking out
of the troubles I commonly used a red coat, to show that I wore the
King's colour-RRB- I begged for a court-martial immediately; and turning
round to two officers who had been present during our altercation,
desired them to remember all that had passed between his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) lordship
and me. These gentlemen were no doubt of my way of thinking as to
the chief's behaviour, and our interview ended in my going ashore
unaccompanied by a guard. The story got wind amongst the Whig gentry,
and was improved in the telling. I had spoken out my mind manfully to
the Governor; no Whig could have uttered sentiments more liberal. When
riots took place in Richmond, and of the Loyalists remaining there, many
were in peril of life and betook themselves to the ships, my mother's
property and house were never endangered, nor her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) family insulted.
We were still at the stage when a reconciliation was fondly thought
possible. <div class="bookquote">``Ah! if all the Tories were like you,''  (<font color='red'><b>a Whig</b></font>)</div>a distinguished Whig
has said to me, <div class="bookquote">``we and the people at home should soon come together
again.''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>This, of course, was before the famous Fourth of July, and that
Declaration which rendered reconcilement impossible. Afterwards, when
parties grew more rancorous, motives much less creditable were assigned
for my conduct, and it was said I chose to be a Liberal Tory because
I was a cunning fox, and wished to keep my estate whatever way things
went. And this, I am bound to say, is the opinion regarding my humble
self which has obtained in very high quarters at home, where a profound
regard for my own interest has been supposed not uncommonly to have
occasioned my conduct during the late unhappy troubles.

<p/>There were two or three persons in the world -LRB-for I had not told my
mother how I was resolved to cede to my brother all my life-interest
in our American property-RRB- who knew that I had no mercenary motives in
regard to the conduct I pursued. It was not worth while to undeceive
others; what were life worth, if a man were forced to feel himself a la
piste of all the calumnies uttered against him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)? And I do not quite know
to this present day, how it happened that my mother, that notorious
Loyalist, was left for several years quite undisturbed in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) house at
Castlewood, a stray troop or company of Continentals being occasionally
quartered upon her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). I do not know for certain, I say, how this piece of
good fortune happened, though I can give a pretty shrewd guess as to the
cause of it. Madam Fanny, after a campaign before Boston, came back to
Fanny's Mount, leaving her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) Colonel. My modest Hal, until the conclusion
of the war, would accept no higher rank, believing that in command of
a regiment he (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>) could be more useful than in charge of a division. Madam
Fanny, I say, came back, and it was remarkable after her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) return how
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) old asperity towards my mother seemed to be removed, and what an
affection she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) showed for her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) and all the property. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was great friends
with the Governor and some of the most influential gentlemen of the new
Assembly:--Madam Esmond was harmless, and for her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) son's sake, who
was bravely battling for his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) country, her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) errors should be lightly
visited:--I know not how it was, but for years she (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) remained unharmed,
except in respect of heavy Government requisitions, which of course she (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>)
had to pay, and it was not until the redcoats appeared about our house,
that much serious evil came to it.




<p/>CHAPTER XC

<p/>In which we both fight and run away


<p/>What was the use of a Colonel without a regiment? The Governor and
Council who had made such a parade of thanks in endowing me with mine,
were away out of sight, skulking on board ships, with an occasional
piracy and arson on shore. My Lord Dunmore's black allies frightened
away those of his (<font color='blue'><b>Dunmore</b></font>) own blood; and besides these negroes whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Dunmore</b></font>) had
summoned round him (<font color='blue'><b>Dunmore</b></font>) in arms, we heard that he (<font color='blue'><b>Dunmore</b></font>) had sent an envoy among
the Indians of the South, and that they were to come down in numbers
and tomahawk our people into good behaviour. <div class="bookquote">``And these are to be our
allies!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I say to my mother, exchanging ominous looks with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), and
remembering, with a ghastly distinctness, that savage whose face glared
over mine, and whose knife was at my throat when Florac struck him (<font color='blue'><b>Dunmore</b></font>) down
on Braddock's Field. We put our house of Castlewood into as good a state
of defence as we could devise; but, in truth, it was more of the red men
and the blacks than of the rebels we were afraid. I never saw my mother
lose courage but once, and then when she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was recounting to us the
particulars of our father's death in a foray of Indians more than forty
years ago. Seeing some figures one night moving in front of our house,
nothing could persuade the good lady but that they were savages, and
she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) sank on her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) knees crying out, <div class="bookquote">``The Lord have mercy upon us! The
Indians--the Indians!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>My lord's negro allies vanished on board his (<font color='blue'><b>allies</b></font>) ships, or where they could
find pay and plunder; but the painted heroes from the South never made
their appearance, though I own to have looked at my mother's grey head,
my wife's brown hair, and our little one's golden ringlets, with a
horrible pang of doubt lest these should fall the victims of ruffian
war. And it was we who fought with such weapons, and enlisted these
allies! But that I dare not -LRB-so to speak-RRB- be setting myself up as
interpreter of Providence, and pointing out the special finger of Heaven
-LRB-as many people are wont to do-RRB-, I would say our employment of these
Indians, and of the German mercenaries, brought their own retribution
with them in this war. In the field, where the mercenaries were attacked
by the Provincials, they yielded, and it was triumphing over them that
so raised the spirit of the Continental army; and the murder of one
woman -LRB-Miss McCrea-RRB- by a half-dozen drunken Indians, did more harm
to the Royal cause than the loss of a battle or the destruction of
regiments.

<p/>Now, the Indian panic over, Madam Esmond's courage returned: and she (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>)
began to be seriously and not unjustly uneasy at the danger which I ran
myself, and which I brought upon others, by remaining in Virginia.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What harm can they do me,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>says she (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``a poor woman? If I have one son
a colonel without a regiment, I have another with a couple of hundred
Continentals behind him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) in Mr. Washington's camp. If the Royalists come,
they will let me off for your sake; if the rebels appear, I shall have
Harry's passport. I don't wish, sir, I don't like that your delicate
wife and this dear little baby should be here, and only increase the
risk of all of us! We must have them away to Boston or New York. Don't
talk about defending me! Who will think of hurting a poor, harmless,
old woman? If the rebels come, I shall shelter behind Mrs. Fanny's
petticoats, and shall be much safer without you in the house than in
it.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>This she (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) said in part, perhaps, because `twas reasonable; more so
because she (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) would have me and my family out of the danger; and danger
or not, for her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) part felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) was determined to remain in the land
where her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) father was buried, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) was born. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) was living backwards,
so to speak. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) had seen the new generation, and blessed them, and bade
them farewell. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) belonged to the past, and old days and memories.

<p/>While we were debating about the Boston scheme, comes the news that
the British have evacuated that luckless city altogether, never having
ventured to attack Mr. Washington in his (<font color='blue'><b>Washington</b></font>) camp at Cambridge -LRB-though he (<font color='blue'><b>Washington</b></font>)
lay there for many months without powder at our mercy-RRB-; but waiting
until he (<font color='blue'><b>Washington</b></font>) procured ammunition, and seized and fortified Dorchester
heights, which commanded the town, out of which the whole British army
and colony was obliged to beat a retreat. That the King's troops won the
battle at Bunker's Hill, there is no more doubt than that they beat the
French at Blenheim; but through the war their chiefs seem constantly to
have been afraid of assaulting entrenched Continentals afterwards; else
why, from July to March, hesitate to strike an almost defenceless enemy?
Why the hesitation at Long Island, when the Continental army was in our
hand? Why that astonishing timorousness--of Howe before Valley Forge,
where the relics of a force starving, sickening, and in rags, could
scarcely man the lines, which they held before a great, victorious, and
perfectly appointed army?

<p/>As the hopes and fears of the contending parties rose and fell, it was
curious to mark the altered tone of the partisans of either. When the
news came to us in the country of the evacuation of Boston, every little
Whig in the neighbourhood made his (<font color='blue'><b>Howe</b></font>) bow to Madam, and advised her (<font color='blue'><b>partisans</b></font>) to
a speedy submission. She (<font color='blue'><b>partisans</b></font>) did not carry her (<font color='blue'><b>partisans</b></font>) loyalty quite so openly as
heretofore, and flaunt her (<font color='blue'><b>partisans</b></font>) flag in the faces of the public, but she (<font color='blue'><b>partisans</b></font>)
never swerved. Every night and morning in private poor Hagan prayed for
the Royal Family in our own household, and on Sundays any neighbours
were welcome to attend the service, where my mother acted as a very
emphatic clerk, and the prayer for the High Court of Parliament under
our most religious and gracious King was very stoutly delivered. The
brave Hagan was a parson without a living, as I was a Militia Colonel
without a regiment. Hagan had continued to pray stoutly for King George
in Williamsburg, long after his (<font color='blue'><b>Hagan</b></font>) Excellency our Governor had run away:
but on coming to church one Sunday to perform his (<font color='blue'><b>Hagan</b></font>) duty, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hagan</b></font>) found a
corporal's guard at the church-door, who told him (<font color='blue'><b>Hagan</b></font>) that the Committee of
Safety had put another divine in his (<font color='blue'><b>Hagan</b></font>) place, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Hagan</b></font>) was requested to keep
a quiet tongue in his (<font color='blue'><b>Hagan</b></font>) head. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hagan</b></font>) told the men to <div class="bookquote">``lead him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) before
their chiefs''  (<font color='red'><b>the men</b></font>)</div>-LRB-our honest friend always loved tall words and tragic
attitudes-RRB-; and accordingly was marched through the streets to the
Capitol, with a chorus of white and coloured blackguards at the skirts
of his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) gown; and had an interview with Messrs. Henry and the new State
officers, and confronted the robbers, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) said, in their den. Of
course he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) was for making an heroic speech before these gentlemen -LRB-and
was one of many men who perhaps would have no objection to be made
martyrs, so that they might be roasted coram populo, or tortured in a
full house-RRB-, but Mr. Henry was determined to give him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) no such chance.
After keeping Hagan three or four hours waiting in an anteroom in
the company of negroes, when the worthy divine entered the new chief
magistrate's room with an undaunted mien, and began a prepared speech
with--<div class="bookquote">``Sir, by what authority am I, a minister of the--''  (<font color='red'><b>the chief magistrate</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Hagan,''
 (<font color='red'><b>the chief magistrate</b></font>)</div>says the other, interrupting him (<font color='blue'><b>magistrate</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``I am too busy to listen to speeches.
And as for King George, he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) has henceforth no more authority in this
country than King Nebuchadnezzar. Mind you that, and hold your tongue,
if you please! Stick to King John, sir, and King Macbeth; and if you
will send round your benefit-tickets, all the Assembly shall come and
hear you. Did you ever see Mr. Hagan on the boards, when you was
in London, General?''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>And, so saying, Henry turns round upon Mr.
Washington's second in command, General Lee, who was now come into
Virginia upon State affairs, and our shamefaced good Hagan was bustled
out of the room, reddening, and almost crying with shame. After this
event we thought that Hagan's ministrations were best confined to us in
the country, and removed the worthy pastor from his (<font color='blue'><b>Hagan</b></font>) restive lambs in the
city.

<p/>The selection of Virginians to the very highest civil and military
appointments of the new government bribed and flattered many of our
leading people, who, otherwise, and but for the outrageous conduct of
our government, might have remained faithful to the Crown, and made
good head against the rising rebellion. But, although we Loyalists were
gagged and muzzled, though the Capitol was in the hands of the Whigs,
and our vaunted levies of loyal recruits so many Falstaff's regiments
for the most part, the faithful still kept intelligences with one
another in the colony, and with our neighbours; and though we did
not rise, and though we ran away, and though, in examination before
committees, justices, and so forth, some of our frightened people gave
themselves Republican airs, and vowed perdition to kings and nobles; yet
we knew each other pretty well, and--according as the chances were more
or less favourable to us, the master more or less hard--we concealed
our colours, showed our colours, half showed our colours, or downright
apostatised for the nonce, and cried, <div class="bookquote">``Down with King George!''  (<font color='red'><b>the master</b></font>)</div>Our
negroes bore about, from house to house, all sorts of messages and
tokens. Endless underhand plots and schemes were engaged in by those who
could not afford the light. The battle over, the neutrals come and join
the winning side, and shout as loudly as the patriots. The runaways
are not counted. Will any man tell me that the signers and ardent
well-wishers of the Declaration of Independence were not in a minority
of the nation, and that the minority did not win? We knew that apart
of the defeated army of Massachusetts was about to make an important
expedition southward, upon the success of which the very greatest hopes
were founded; and I, for one, being anxious to make a movement as soon
as there was any chance of activity, had put myself in communication
with the ex-Governor Martin, of North Carolina, whom I proposed to join,
with three or four of our Virginian gentlemen, officers of that notable
corps of which we only wanted privates. We made no particular mystery
about our departure from Castlewood; the affairs of Congress were
not going so well yet that the new government could afford to lay any
particular stress or tyranny upon persons of a doubtful way of thinking.
Gentlemen's houses were still open; and in our southern fashion we would
visit our friends for months at a time. My wife and I, with our infant
and a fitting suite of servants, took leave of Madam Esmond on a visit
to a neighbouring plantation. We went thence to another friend's house,
and then to another, till finally we reached Wilmington, in North
Carolina, which was the point at which we expected to stretch a hand to
the succours which were coming to meet us.

<p/>Ere our arrival, our brother Carolinian Royalists had shown themselves
in some force. Their encounters with the Whigs had been unlucky. The
poor Highlanders had been no more fortunate in their present contest in
favour of King George, than when they had drawn their swords against him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
in their own country. We did not reach Wilmington until the end of May,
by which time we found Admiral Parker's squadron there, with General
Clinton and five British regiments on board, whose object was a descent
upon Charleston.

<p/>The General, to whom I immediately made myself known, seeing that my
regiment consisted of Lady Warrington, our infant, whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) was nursing,
and three negro servants, received us at first with a very grim welcome.
But Captain Horner of the Sphinx frigate, who had been on the Jamaica
station, and received, like all the rest of the world, many kindnesses
from our dear Governor there, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Governor</b></font>) heard that my wife was General
Lambert's daughter, eagerly received her (<font color='blue'><b>Lambert</b></font>) on board, and gave up his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>)
best cabin to our service; and so we were refugees, too, like my Lord
Dunmore, having waved our flag, to be sure, and pocketed it, and
slipped out at the back door. From Wilmington we bore away quickly to
Charleston, and in the course of the voyage and our delay in the river,
previous to our assault on the place, I made some acquaintance with
Mr. Clinton, which increased to a further intimacy. It was the King's
birthday when we appeared in the river: we determined it was a glorious
day for the commencement of the expedition.

<p/>It did not take place for some days after, and I leave out, purposely,
all descriptions of my Penelope parting from her (<font color='blue'><b>Penelope</b></font>) Hector, going forth on
this expedition. In the first place, Hector is perfectly well -LRB-though
a little gouty-RRB-, nor has any rascal of a Pyrrhus made a prize of his (<font color='blue'><b>rascal</b></font>)
widow: and in times of war and commotion, are not such scenes of woe and
terror, and parting, occurring every hour? I can see the gentle face yet
over the bulwark, as we descend the ship's side into the boats, and the
smile of the infant on her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) arm. What old stories, to be sure! Captain
Miles, having no natural taste for poetry, you have forgot the verses,
no doubt, in Mr. Pope's Homer, in which you are described as parting
with your heroic father; but your mother often read them to you as
a boy, and keeps the gorget I wore on that day somewhere amongst her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
dressing-boxes now.

<p/>My second venture at fighting was no more lucky than my first. We came
back to our ships that evening thoroughly beaten. The madcap Lee, whom
Clinton had faced at Boston, now met him (<font color='blue'><b>Clinton</b></font>) at Charleston. Lee, and the
gallant garrison there, made a brilliant and most successful resistance.
The fort on Sullivan's Island, which we attacked, was a nut we could not
crack. The fire of all our frigates was not strong enough to pound its
shell; the passage by which we moved up to the assault of the place was
not fordable, as those officers found--Sir Henry at the head of them,
who was always the first to charge--who attempted to wade it. Death by
shot, by drowning, by catching my death of cold, I had braved before I
returned to my wife; and our frigate being aground for a time and got
off with difficulty, was agreeably cannonaded by the enemy until she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) got
off her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) bank.

<p/>A small incident in the midst of this unlucky struggle was the occasion
of a subsequent intimacy which arose between me and Sir Harry Clinton,
and bound me to that most gallant officer during the Period in which
it was my fortune to follow the war. Of his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) qualifications as a leader
there may be many opinions: I fear to say, regarding a man I heartily
respect and admire, there ought only to be one. Of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) personal bearing
and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) courage there can be no doubt; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was always eager to show it;
and whether at the final charge on Breed's Hill, when at the head of
the rallied troops he (<font color='blue'><b>Hill</b></font>) carried the Continental lines, or here before
Sullivan's Fort, or a year later at Fort Washington, when, standard in
hand, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sullivan</b></font>) swept up the height, and entered the fort at the head of the
storming column, Clinton was always foremost in the race of battle, and
the King's service knew no more admirable soldier.

<p/>We were taking to the water from our boats, with the intention of
forcing a column to the fort, through a way which our own guns had
rendered practicable, when a shot struck a boat alongside of us, so
well aimed, as actually to put three-fourths of the boat's crew hors de
combat, and knock down the officer steering, and the flag behind him (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>).
I could not help crying out, <div class="bookquote">``Bravo! well aimed!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>for no ninepins ever
went down more helplessly than these poor fellows before the round shot.
Then the General, turning round to me, says, rather grimly, <div class="bookquote">``Sir, the
behaviour of the enemy seems to please you!''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I am pleased, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>says
I, <div class="bookquote">``that my countrymen, yonder, should fight as becomes our nation.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>We floundered on towards the fort in the midst of the same amiable
attentions from small arms and great, until we found the water was up
to our breasts and deepening at every step, when we were fain to take
to our boats again and pull out of harm's way. Sir Henry waited upon my
Lady Warrington on board the Sphinx after this, and was very gracious to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>), and mighty facetious regarding the character of the humble writer
of the present memoir, whom his (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) Excellency always described as a rebel
at heart. I pray my children may live to see or engage in no great
revolutions,--such as that, for instance, raging in the country of our
miserable French neighbours. Save a very, very few indeed, the actors in
those great tragedies do not bear to be scanned too closely; the chiefs
are often no better than ranting quacks; the heroes ignoble puppets; the
heroines anything but pure. The prize is not always to the brave. In our
revolution it certainly did fall, for once and for a wonder, to the
most deserving: but who knows his (<font color='blue'><b>chiefs</b></font>) enemies now? His (<font color='blue'><b>chiefs</b></font>) great and surprising
triumphs were not in those rare engagements with the enemy where he (<font color='blue'><b>chiefs</b></font>)
obtained a trifling mastery; but over Congress; over hunger and disease;
over lukewarm friends, or smiling foes in his (<font color='blue'><b>chiefs</b></font>) own camp, whom his (<font color='blue'><b>chiefs</b></font>) great
spirit had to meet and master. When the struggle was over, and our
important chiefs who had conducted it began to squabble and accuse
each other in their own defence before the nation--what charges and
counter-charges were brought; what pretexts of delay were urged; what
piteous excuses were put forward that this fleet arrived too late; that
that regiment mistook its orders; that these cannon-balls would not fit
those guns; and so to the end of the chapter! Here was a general who
beat us with no shot at times, and no powder, and no money; and he (<font color='blue'><b>general</b></font>) never
thought of a convention; his (<font color='blue'><b>general</b></font>) courage never capitulated! Through all the
doubt and darkness, the danger and long tempest of the war, I think it
was only the American leader's indomitable soul that remained entirely
steady.

<p/>Of course our Charleston expedition was made the most of, and pronounced
a prodigious victory by the enemy, who had learnt -LRB-from their parents,
perhaps-RRB- to cry victory if a corporal's guard were surprised, as loud
as if we had won a pitched battle. Mr. Lee rushed back to New York, the
conqueror of conquerors, trumpeting his (<font color='blue'><b>Lee</b></font>) glory, and by no man received
with more eager delight than by the Commander-in-Chief of the American
Army. It was my dear Lee and my dear General between them, then; and it
hath always touched me in the history of our early Revolution to note
that simple confidence and admiration with which the General-in-Chief
was wont to regard officers under him (<font color='blue'><b>Lee</b></font>), who had happened previously to
serve with the King's army. So the Mexicans of old looked and wondered
when they first saw an armed Spanish horseman! And this mad, flashy
braggart -LRB-and another Continental general, whose name and whose luck
afterwards were sufficiently notorious-RRB- you may be sure took advantage
of the modesty of the Commander-in-Chief, and advised, and blustered,
and sneered, and disobeyed orders; daily presenting fresh obstacles
-LRB-as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Commander-in-Chief</b></font>) had not enough otherwise!-RRB- in the path over which only Mr.
Washington's astonishing endurance could have enabled him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) to march.

<p/>Whilst we were away on our South Carolina expedition, the famous Fourth
of July had taken place, and we and the thirteen United States were
parted for ever. My own native state of Virginia had also distinguished
itself by announcing that all men are equally free; that all power is
vested in the people, who have an inalienable right to alter, reform,
or abolish their form of government at pleasure, and that the idea of
an hereditary first magistrate is unnatural and absurd! Our General
presented me with this document fresh from Williamsburg, as we were
sailing northward by the Virginia capes, and, amidst not a little
amusement and laughter, pointed out to me the faith to which, from the
Fourth inst. inclusive, I was bound. There was no help for it; I was a
Virginian--my godfathers had promised and vowed, in my name, that all
men were equally free -LRB-including, of course, the race of poor Gumbo-RRB-,
that the idea of a monarchy is absurd, and that I had the right to alter
my form of government at pleasure. I thought of Madam Esmond at home,
and how she (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) would look when these articles of faith were brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) to
subscribe; how would Hagan receive them? He (<font color='blue'><b>Hagan</b></font>) demolished them in a sermon,
in which all the logic was on his (<font color='blue'><b>Hagan</b></font>) side, but the U.S. Government has not,
somehow, been affected by the discourse; and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Hagan</b></font>) came to touch upon
the point that all men being free, therefore Gumbo and Sady, and Nathan,
had assuredly a right to go to Congress: <div class="bookquote">``Tut, tut! my good Mr. Hagan,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Congress</b></font>)</div>says my mother, <div class="bookquote">``let us hear no more of this nonsense; but leave such
wickedness and folly to the rebels!''

 (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div><p/>By the middle of August we were before New York, whither Mr. Howe had
brought his (<font color='blue'><b>Howe</b></font>) army that had betaken itself to Halifax after its inglorious
expulsion from Boston. The American Commander-in-Chief was at New
York, and a great battle inevitable; and I looked forward to it with
an inexpressible feeling of doubt and anxiety, knowing that my dearest
brother and his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) regiment formed part of the troops whom we must attack,
and could not but overpower. Almost the whole of the American army came
over to fight on a small island, where every officer on both sides knew
that they were to be beaten, and whence they had not a chance of escape.
Two frigates, out of a hundred we had placed so as to command the
enemy's entrenched camp and point of retreat across East River to New
York, would have destroyed every bark in which he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) sought to fly, and
compelled him (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) to lay down his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) arms on shore. He (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) fought: his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) hasty levies
were utterly overthrown; some of his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) generals, his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) best troops, his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>)
artillery taken; the remnant huddled into their entrenched camp after
their rout, the pursuers entering it with them. The victors were called
back; the enemy was then pent up in a corner of the island, and could
not escape. <div class="bookquote">``They are at our mercy, and are ours to-morrow,''  (<font color='red'><b>the General</b></font>)</div>says the
gentle General. Not a ship was set to watch the American force; not
a sentinel of ours could see a movement in their camp. A whole army
crossed under our eyes in one single night to the mainland without the
loss of a single man; and General Howe was suffered to remain in command
after this feat, and to complete his (<font color='blue'><b>Howe</b></font>) glories of Long Island and Breed's
Hill, at Philadelphia! A friend, to be sure, crossed in the night to say
the enemy's army was being ferried over, but he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) fell upon a picket of
Germans: they could not understand him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>): their commander was boozing or
asleep. In the morning, when the spy was brought to some one who could
comprehend the American language, the whole Continental force had
crossed the East River, and the empire over thirteen colonies had
slipped away.

<p/>The opinions I had about our chief were by no means uncommon in the
army; though, perhaps, wisely kept secret by gentlemen under Mr. Howe's
immediate command. Am I more unlucky than other folks, I wonder? or why
are my imprudent sayings carried about more than my neighbours'? My rage
that such a use was made of such a victory was no greater than that of
scores of gentlemen with the army. Why must my name forsooth be given up
to the Commander-in-Chief as that of the most guilty of the
grumblers? Personally, General Howe was perfectly brave, amiable, and
good-humoured.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So, Sir George,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>says he (<font color='blue'><b>Howe</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``you find fault with me, as a military
man, because there was a fog after the battle on Long Island, and your
friends, the Continentals, gave me the slip! Surely we took and killed
enough of them; but there is no satisfying you gentlemen amateurs!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Howe</b></font>) turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Howe</b></font>) back on me, and shrugged his (<font color='blue'><b>Howe</b></font>) shoulders, and talked to some
one else. Amateur I might be, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Howe</b></font>) the most amiable of men; but if
King George had said to him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``Never more be officer of mine,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>yonder
agreeable and pleasant Cassio would most certainly have had his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) desert.

<p/>I soon found how our Chief had come in possession of his (<font color='blue'><b>Chief</b></font>) information
regarding myself. My admirable cousin, Mr. William Esmond--who of course
had forsaken New York and his (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) post, when all the Royal authorities fled
out of the place, and Washington occupied it,--returned along with our
troops and fleets; and, being a gentleman of good birth and name, and
well acquainted with the city, made himself agreeable to the newcomers
of the Royal army, the young bloods, merry fellows, and macaronis, by
introducing them to play-tables, taverns, and yet worse places, with
which the worthy gentleman continued to be familiar in the New World
as in the Old. Coelum non animum. However Will had changed his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) air, or
whithersoever he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) transported his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) carcase, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) carried a rascal in his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
skin.

<p/>I had heard a dozen stories of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) sayings regarding my family, and was
determined neither to avoid him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) nor seek him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>); but to call him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) to account
whensoever we met; and, chancing one day to be at a coffee-house in a
friend's company, my worthy kinsman swaggered in with a couple of young
lads of the army, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>kinsman</b></font>) found it was his (<font color='blue'><b>kinsman</b></font>) pleasure and profit now
to lead into every kind of dissipation. I happened to know one of Mr.
Will's young companions, an aide-de-camp of General Clinton's, who had
been in my close company both at Charleston, before Sullivan's Island,
and in the action of Brooklyn, where our General gloriously led the
right wing of the English army. They took a box without noticing us
at first, though I heard my name three or four times mentioned by
my brawling kinsman, who ended some drunken speech he (<font color='blue'><b>kinsman</b></font>) was making by
slapping his (<font color='blue'><b>kinsman</b></font>) fist on the table, and swearing, <div class="bookquote">``By--, I will do for
him (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>), and the bloody rebel, his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) brother!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! Mr. Esmond,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>says I, coming forward with my hat on. -LRB-He (<font color='blue'><b>kinsman</b></font>) looked a
little pale behind his (<font color='blue'><b>kinsman</b></font>) punch-bowl.-RRB- <div class="bookquote">``I have long wanted to see you, to
set some little matters right about which there has been a difference
between us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And what may those be, sir?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>says he (<font color='blue'><b>kinsman</b></font>), with a volley of oaths.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You have chosen to cast a doubt upon my courage, and say that I shirked
a meeting with you when we were young men. Our relationship and our age
ought to prevent us from having recourse to such murderous follies''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Will/Will/Will Esmond</b></font>)</div>-LRB-Mr.
Will started up, looking fierce and relieved-RRB-, <div class="bookquote">``but I give you notice,
that though I can afford to overlook lies against myself, if I hear from
you a word in disparagement of my brother, Colonel Warrington, of the
Continental Army, I will hold you accountable.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Will/Will/Will Esmond</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed, gentlemen! Mighty fine, indeed! You take notice of Sir George
Warrington's words!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Will/Will/Will Esmond</b></font>)</div>cries Mr. Will over his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) punch-bowl.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You have been pleased to say,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I continued, growing angry as I spoke,
and being a fool therefore for my pains, <div class="bookquote">``that the very estates we hold
in this country are not ours, but of right revert to your family!''

 (<font color='red'><b>a fool</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So they are ours! By George, they're ours! I've heard my brother
Castlewood say so a score of times!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Will/Will/Will Esmond</b></font>)</div>swears Mr. Will.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``In that case, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>says I, hotly, <div class="bookquote">``your brother, my Lord Castlewood,
tells no more truth than yourself. We have the titles at hone in
Virginia. They are registered in the courts there; and if ever I hear
one word more of this impertinence, I shall call you to account where no
constables will be at hand to interfere!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wonder,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>cries Will, in a choking voice, <div class="bookquote">``that I don't cut him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) into
twenty thousand pieces as he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) stands there before me with his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) confounded
yellow face. It was my brother Castlewood won his (<font color='blue'><b>Castlewood</b></font>) money--no, it was his (<font color='blue'><b>Castlewood</b></font>)
brother; d-- you, which are you, the rebel or the other? I hate the
ugly faces of both of you, and, hic!--if you are for the King, show you
are for the King, and drink his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) health!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) sank down into his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) box
with a hiccup and a wild laugh, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) repeated a dozen times, with
a hundred more oaths and vociferous outcries that I should drink the
King's health.

<p/>To reason with a creature in this condition, or ask explanations or
apologies from him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>), was absurd. I left Mr. Will to reel to his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) lodgings
under the care of his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) young friends--who were surprised to find an old
toper so suddenly affected and so utterly prostrated by liquor--and
limped home to my wife, whom I found happy in possession of a brief
letter from Hal, which a countryman had brought in; and who said not a
word about the affairs of the Continentals with whom he (<font color='blue'><b>countryman</b></font>) was engaged,
but wrote a couple of pages of rapturous eulogiums upon his (<font color='blue'><b>countryman</b></font>) brother's
behaviour in the field, which my dear Hal was pleased to admire, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>)
admired everything I said and did.

<p/>I rather looked for a messenger from my amiable kinsman in consequence
of the speeches which had passed between us the night before, and did
not know but that I might be called by Will to make my words good; and
when accordingly Mr. Lacy -LRB-our companion of the previous evening-RRB- made
his (<font color='blue'><b>Lacy</b></font>) appearance at an early hour of the forenoon, I was beckoning my Lady
Warrington to leave us, when, with a laugh and a cry of <div class="bookquote">``Oh dear, no!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Warrington</b></font>)</div>Mr. Lacy begged her (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) ladyship not to disturb herself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have seen,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>says he (<font color='blue'><b>Lacy</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``a gentleman who begs to send you his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) apologies
if he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) uttered a word last night which could offend you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What apologies? what words?''  (<font color='red'><b>the wife</b></font>)</div>asks the anxious wife.

<p/>I explained that roaring Will Esmond had met me in a coffee-house on the
previous evening, and quarrelled with me, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) had done with hundreds
before. <div class="bookquote">``It appears the fellow is constantly abusive, and invariably
pleads drunkenness, and apologises the next morning, unless he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) is caned
over-night,''  (<font color='red'><b>Captain</b></font>)</div>remarked Captain Lacy. And my lady, I dare say, makes a
little sermon, and asks why we gentlemen will go to idle coffee-houses
and run the risk of meeting roaring, roystering Will Esmonds?

<p/>Our sojourn in New York was enlivened by a project for burning the city
which some ardent patriots entertained and partially executed. Several
such schemes were laid in the course of the war, and each one of the
principal cities was doomed to fire; though, in the interests of peace
and goodwill, I hope it will be remembered that these plans never
originated with the cruel government of a tyrant king, but were always
proposed by gentlemen on the Continental side, who vowed that, rather
than remain under the ignominious despotism of the ruffian of Brunswick,
the fairest towns of America should burn. I presume that the sages who
were for burning down Boston were not actual proprietors in that
place, and the New York burners might come from other parts of the
country--from Philadelphia, or what not. Howbeit, the British spared
you, gentlemen, and we pray you give us credit for this act of
moderation.

<p/>I had not the fortune to be present in the action on the White Plains,
being detained by the hurt which I had received at Long Island, and
which broke out again and again, and took some time in the healing. The
tenderest of nurses watched me through my tedious malady, and was eager
for the day when I should doff my militia coat and return to the quiet
English home where Hetty and our good General were tending our children.
Indeed I don't know that I have yet forgiven myself for the pains and
terrors that I must have caused my poor wife, by keeping her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) separate
from her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) young ones, and away from her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) home, because, forsooth, I wished
to see a little more of the war then going on. Our grand tour in Europe
had been all very well. We had beheld St. Peter's at Rome, and the
Bishop thereof; the Dauphiness of France -LRB-alas, to think that glorious
head should ever have been brought so low!-RRB- at Paris; and the rightful
King of England at Florence. I had dipped my gout in a half-dozen baths
and spas, and played cards in a hundred courts, as my Travels in Europe
-LRB-which I propose to publish after my completion of the History of the
American War-RRB- will testify. -LSB-Neither of these two projected works of Sir
George Warrington were brought, as it appears, to a completion.-RSB- And,
during our peregrinations, my hypochondria diminished -LRB-which plagued me
woefully at home-RRB-; and my health and spirits visibly improved. Perhaps
it was because she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) saw the evident benefit I had from excitement and
change, that my wife was reconciled to my continuing to enjoy them; and
though secretly suffering pangs at being away from her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) nursery and her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
eldest boy -LRB-for whom she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) ever has had an absurd infatuation-RRB-, the
dear hypocrite scarce allowed a look of anxiety to appear on her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) face;
encouraged me with smiles; professed herself eager to follow me; asked
why it should be a sin in me to covet honour? and, in a word, was ready
to stay, to go, to smile, to be sad; to scale mountains, or to go down
to the sea in ships; to say that cold was pleasant, heat tolerable,
hunger good sport, dirty lodgings delightful; though she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) is wretched
sailor, very delicate about the little she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) eats, and an extreme sufferer
both of cold and heat. Hence, as I willed to stay on yet a while on my
native continent, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was certain nothing was so good for me; and when
I was minded to return home--oh, how she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) brightened, and kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
infant, and told him (<font color='blue'><b>sufferer</b></font>) how he (<font color='blue'><b>sufferer</b></font>) should see the beautiful gardens at home,
and Aunt Theo, and grandpapa, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) sister, and Miles. <div class="bookquote">``Miles!''  (<font color='red'><b>the parrot</b></font>)</div>cries
the little parrot, mocking its mother--and crowing; as if there was any
mighty privilege in seeing Mr. Miles, forsooth, who was under Doctor
Sumner's care at Harrow-on-the-Hill, where, to do the gentleman justice,
he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) showed that he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) could eat more tarts than any boy in the school, and
took most creditable prizes at football and hare-and-hounds.




<p/>CHAPTER XCI. Satis Pugnae


<p/>It has always seemed to me -LRB-I speak under the correction of military
gentlemen-RRB- that the entrenchments of Breed's Hill served the Continental
army throughout the whole of our American war. The slaughter inflicted
upon us from behind those lines was so severe, and the behaviour of the
enemy so resolute, that the British chiefs respected the barricades
of the Americans hereafter; and were they firing from behind a row of
blankets, certain of our generals rather hesitated to force them. In the
affair of the White Plains, when, for a second time, Mr. Washington's
army was quite at the mercy of the victors, we subsequently heard
that our conquering troops were held back before a barricade actually
composed of cornstalks and straw. Another opportunity was given us, and
lasted during a whole winter, during which the dwindling and dismayed
troops of Congress lay starving and unarmed under our grasp, and the
magnanimous Mr. Howe left the famous camp of Valley Forge untouched,
whilst his (<font color='blue'><b>Howe</b></font>) great, brave, and perfectly appointed army fiddled and
gambled and feasted in Philadelphia. And, by Byng's countrymen,
triumphal arches were erected, tournaments were held in pleasant mockery
of the middle ages, and wreaths and garlands offered by beautiful ladies
to this clement chief, with fantastical mottoes and posies announcing
that his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) laurels should be immortal! Why have my ungrateful countrymen
in America never erected statues to this general? They had not in all
their army an officer who fought their battles better; who enabled them
to retrieve their errors with such adroitness; who took care that their
defeats should be so little hurtful to themselves; and when, in the
course of events, the stronger force naturally got the uppermost, who
showed such an untiring tenderness, patience, and complacency in helping
the poor disabled opponent on to his (<font color='blue'><b>opponent</b></font>) legs again. Ah! think of eighteen
years before and the fiery young warrior whom England had sent out to
fight her (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) adversary on the American continent. Fancy him (<font color='blue'><b>adversary</b></font>) for ever pacing
round the defences behind which the foe lies sheltered; by night and by
day alike sleepless and eager; consuming away in his (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) fierce wrath and
longing, and never closing his (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) eye, so intent is it in watching; winding
the track with untiring scent that pants and hungers for blood and
battle; prowling through midnight forests, or climbing silent over
precipices before dawn; and watching till his (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) great heart is almost worn
out, until the foe shows himself at last, when he (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) springs on him (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) and
grapples with him (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>), and, dying, slays him (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>)! Think of Wolfe at Quebec,
and hearken to Howe's fiddles as he (<font color='blue'><b>Howe</b></font>) sits smiling amongst the dancers at
Philadelphia!

<p/>A favourite scheme with our ministers at home and some of our generals
in America, was to establish a communication between Canada and New
York, by which means it was hoped New England might be cut off from
the neighbouring colonies, overpowered in detail, and forced into
submission. Burgoyne was entrusted with the conduct of the plan, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgoyne</b></font>)
set forth from Quebec, confidently promising to bring it to a
successful issue. His (<font color='blue'><b>Burgoyne</b></font>) march began in military state: the trumpets of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Burgoyne</b></font>) proclamations blew before him (<font color='blue'><b>Burgoyne</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgoyne</b></font>) bade the colonists to remember the
immense power of England; and summoned the misguided rebels to lay down
their arms. He (<font color='blue'><b>Burgoyne</b></font>) brought with him (<font color='blue'><b>Burgoyne</b></font>) a formidable English force, an army of
German veterans not less powerful, a dreadful band of Indian warriors,
and a brilliant train of artillery. It was supposed that the people
round his (<font color='blue'><b>Burgoyne</b></font>) march would rally to the Royal cause and standards. The
Continental force in front of him (<font color='blue'><b>Burgoyne</b></font>) was small at first, and Washington's
army was weakened by the withdrawal of troops who were hurried forward
to meet this Canadian invasion. A British detachment from New York was
to force its way up the Hudson, sweeping away the enemy on the route,
and make a junction with Burgoyne at Albany. Then was the time when
Washington's weakened army should have been struck too; but a greater
Power willed otherwise: nor am I, for one, even going to regret the
termination of the war. As we look over the game now, how clear seem the
blunders which were made by the losing side! From the beginning to the
end we were for ever arriving too late. Our supplies and reinforcements
from home were too late. Our troops were in difficulty, and our succours
reached them too late. Our fleet appeared off York Town just too
late, after Cornwallis had surrendered. A way of escape was opened
to Burgoyne, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgoyne</b></font>) resolved upon retreat too late. I have heard
discomfited officers in after days prove infallibly how a different wind
would have saved America to us; how we must have destroyed the French
fleet but for a tempest or two; how once, twice, thrice, but for
nightfall, Mr. Washington and his (<font color='blue'><b>Washington</b></font>) army were in our power. Who has not
speculated, in the course of his (<font color='blue'><b>Washington</b></font>) reading of history, upon the <div class="bookquote">``Has been''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>and the <div class="bookquote">``Might have been''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>in the world? I take my tattered old map-book
from the shelf, and see the board on which the great contest was played;
I wonder at the curious chances which lost it: and, putting aside any
idle talk about the respective bravery of the two nations, can't but see
that we had the best cards, and that we lost the game.

<p/>I own the sport had a considerable fascination for me, and stirred up
my languid blood. My brother Hal, when settled on his (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>) plantation in
Virginia, was perfectly satisfied with the sports and occupations he (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>)
found there. The company of the country neighbours sufficed him (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>)
never tired of looking after his (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>) crops and people, taking his (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>) fish,
shooting his (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>) ducks, hunting in his (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>) woods, or enjoying his (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>) rubber and
his (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>) supper. Happy Hal, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>) great barn of a house, under his (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>) roomy
porches, his (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>) dogs lying round his (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>) feet; his (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>) friends, the Virginian Will
Wimbles, at free quarters in his (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>) mansion; his (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>) negroes fat, lazy, and
ragged: his (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>) shrewd little wife ruling over them and her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) husband, who
always obeyed her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) implicitly when living, and who was pretty speedily
consoled when she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) died! I say happy, though his (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>) lot would have been
intolerable to me: wife, and friends, and plantation, and town life at
Richmond -LRB-Richmond succeeded to the honour of being the capital when our
Province became a State-RRB-. How happy he (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>) whose foot fits the shoe which
fortune gives him (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>)! My income was five times as great, my house in
England as large, and built of bricks and faced with freestone; my
wife--would I have changed her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) for any other wife in the world? My
children--well, I am contented with my Lady Warrington's opinion about
them. But with all these plums and peaches and rich fruits out of
Plenty's horn poured into my lap, I fear I have been but an ingrate;
and Hodge, my gatekeeper, who shares his (<font color='blue'><b>Hodge</b></font>) bread and scrap of bacon with
a family as large as his (<font color='blue'><b>Hodge</b></font>) master's, seems to me to enjoy his (<font color='blue'><b>Hodge</b></font>) meal as much
as I do, though Mrs. Molly prepares her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) best dishes and sweetmeats, and
Mr. Gumbo uncorks the choicest bottle from the cellar. Ah me! sweetmeats
have lost their savour for me, however they may rejoice my young ones
from the nursery, and the perfume of claret palls upon old noses!
Our parson has poured out his (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) sermons many and many a time to me, and
perhaps I did not care for them much when he (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) first broached them. Dost
thou remember, honest friend? -LRB-sure he (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) does, for he (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) has repeated the
story over the bottle as many times as his (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) sermons almost, and my Lady
Warrington pretends as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) had never heard it-RRB---I say, Joe Blake,
thou rememberest full well, and with advantages, that October evening
when we scrambled up an embrasure at Fort Clinton and a clubbed musket
would have dashed these valuable brains out, had not Joe's sword whipped
my rebellious countryman through the gizzard. Joe wore a red coat in
those days -LRB-the uniform of the brave Sixty-third, whose leader, the bold
Sill, fell pierced with many wounds beside him (<font color='blue'><b>leader</b></font>)-RRB-. He (<font color='blue'><b>leader</b></font>) exchanged his (<font color='blue'><b>leader</b></font>) red
for black and my pulpit. His (<font color='blue'><b>leader</b></font>) doctrines are sound, and his (<font color='blue'><b>leader</b></font>) sermons short.
We read the papers together over our wine. Not two months ago we read
our old friend Howe's glorious deed of the first of June. We were told
how the noble Rawdon, who fought with us at Fort Clinton, had joined the
Duke of York: and to-day his (<font color='blue'><b>Clinton</b></font>) Royal Highness is in full retreat before
Pichegru: and he (<font color='blue'><b>Highness</b></font>) and my son Miles have taken Valenciennes for nothing!
Ah, parson! would you not like to put on your old Sixty-third coat?
-LRB-though I doubt Mrs. Blake could never make the buttons and button-holes
meet again over your big body-RRB-. The boys were acting a play with my
militia sword. Oh, that I were young again, Mr. Blake! that I had not
the gout in my toe; and I would saddle Rosinante and ride back into
the world, and feel the pulses beat again, and play a little of life's
glorious game!

<p/>The last <div class="bookquote">``hit''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>which I saw played, was gallantly won by our side; though
`tis true that even in this parti the Americans won the rubber--our
people gaining only the ground they stood on, and the guns, stores, and
ships which they captured and destroyed, whilst our efforts at rescue
were too late to prevent the catastrophe impending over Burgoyne's
unfortunate army. After one of those delays which always were happening
to retard our plans and weaken the blows which our chiefs intended to
deliver, an expedition was got under weigh from New York at the close
of the month of September, `77; that, could it have but advanced a
fortnight earlier, might have saved the doomed force of Burgoyne. Sed
Dis aliter visum. The delay here was not Sir Henry Clinton's fault, who
could not leave his (<font color='blue'><b>Clinton</b></font>) city unprotected; but the winds and weather which
delayed the arrival of reinforcements which we had long awaited from
England. The fleet which brought them brought us long and fond letters
from home, with the very last news of the children under the care of
their good Aunt Hetty and their grandfather. The mother's heart yearned
towards the absent young ones. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) made me no reproaches: but I could
read her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) importunities in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) anxious eyes, her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) terrors for me, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
longing for her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) children. <div class="bookquote">``Why stay longer?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) seemed to say. <div class="bookquote">``You
who have no calling to this war, or to draw the sword against your
countrymen--why continue to imperil your life and my happiness?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I
understood her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) appeal. We were to enter upon no immediate service of
danger; I told her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) Sir Henry was only going to accompany the expedition
for a part of the way. I would return with him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>), the reconnaissance over,
and Christmas, please Heaven, should see our family once more united in
England.

<p/>A force of three thousand men, including a couple of slender regiments
of American Loyalists and New York Militia -LRB-with which latter my
distinguished relative, Mr. Will Esmond, went as captain-RRB-, was embarked
at New York, and our armament sailed up the noble Hudson River, that
presents finer aspects than the Rhine in Europe to my mind: nor was
any fire opened upon us from those beetling cliffs and precipitous
<div class="bookquote">``palisades,''  (<font color='red'><b>captain</b></font>)</div>as they are called, by which we sailed; the enemy, strange
to say, being for once unaware of the movement we contemplated. Our
first landing was on the Eastern bank, at a place called Verplancks
Point, whence the Congress troops withdrew after a slight resistance,
their leader, the tough old Putnam -LRB-so famous during the war-RRB- supposing
that our march was to be directed towards the Eastern Highlands, by
which we intended to penetrate to Burgoyne. Putnam fell back to occupy
these passes, a small detachment of ours being sent forward as if in
pursuit, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgoyne</b></font>) imagined was to be followed by the rest of our force.
Meanwhile, before daylight, two thousand men without artillery, were
carried over to Stoney Point on the Western shore, opposite Verplancks,
and under a great hill called the Dunderberg by the old Dutch lords of
the stream, and which hangs precipitously over it. A little stream
at the northern base of this mountain intersects it from the opposite
height on which Fort Clinton stood, named not after our general, but
after one of the two gentlemen of the same name, who were amongst the
oldest and most respected of the provincial gentry of New York, and who
were at this moment actually in command against Sir Henry. On the next
height to Clinton is Fort Montgomery; and behind them rises a hill
called Bear Hill; whilst at the opposite side of the magnificent stream
stands <div class="bookquote">``Saint Antony's Nose,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bear</b></font>)</div>a prodigious peak indeed, which the Dutch
had quaintly christened.

<p/>The attacks on the two forts were almost simultaneous. Half our men were
detached for the assault on Fort Montgomery, under the brave Campbell,
who fell before the rampart. Sir Henry, who would never be out of danger
where he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) could find it, personally led the remainder, and hoped, he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)
said, that we should have better luck than before the Sullivan Island. A
path led up to the Dunderberg, so narrow as scarcely to admit three men
abreast, and in utter silence our whole force scaled it, wondering at
every rugged step to meet with no opposition. The enemy had not even
kept a watch on it; nor were we descried until we were descending the
height, at the base of which we easily dispersed a small force sent
hurriedly to oppose us. The firing which here took place rendered all
idea of a surprise impossible. The fort was before us. With such arms
as the troops had in their hands, they had to assault; and silently
and swiftly, in the face of the artillery playing upon them, the troops
ascended the hill. The men had orders on no account to fire. Taking the
colours of the Sixty-third, and bearing them aloft, Sir Henry mounted
with the stormers. The place was so steep that the men pushed each
other over the wall and through the embrasures; and it was there that
Lieutenant Joseph Blake, the father of a certain Joseph Clinton Blake,
who looks with the eyes of affection on a certain young lady, presented
himself to the living of Warrington by saving the life of the unworthy
patron thereof.

<p/>About a fourth part of the garrison, as we were told, escaped out of
the fort, the rest being killed or wounded, or remaining our prisoners
within the works. Fort Montgomery was, in like manner, stormed and taken
by our people; and, at night, as we looked down from the heights where
the king's standard had been just planted, we were treated to a splendid
illumination in the river below. Under Fort Montgomery, and stretching
over to that lofty prominence, called Saint Antony's Nose, a boom and
chain had been laid with a vast cost and labour, behind which several
American frigates and galleys were anchored. The fort being taken, these
ships attempted to get up the river in the darkness, out of the reach of
guns which they knew must destroy them in the morning. But the wind was
unfavourable, and escape was found to be impossible. The crews therefore
took to the boats, and so landed, having previously set the ships on
fire with all their sails set; and we beheld these magnificent pyramids
of flame burning up to the heavens and reflected in the waters below,
until, in the midst of prodigious explosions, they sank and disappeared.

<p/>On the next day a parlementaire came in from the enemy, to inquire as to
the state of his (<font color='blue'><b>parlementaire</b></font>) troops left wounded or prisoners in our hands, and the
Continental officer brought me a note, which gave me a strange shock,
for it showed that in the struggle of the previous evening my brother
had been engaged. It was dated October 7, from Major-General George
Clinton's divisional headquarters, and it stated briefly that <div class="bookquote">``Colonel
H. Warrington, of the Virginia line, hopes that Sir George Warrington
escaped unhurt in the assault of last evening, from which the Colonel
himself was so fortunate as to retire without the least injury.''  (<font color='red'><b>George Clinton</b></font>)</div>Never
did I say my prayers more heartily and gratefully than on that night,
devoutly thanking Heaven that my dearest brother was spared, and making
a vow at the same time to withdraw out of the fratricidal contest, into
which I only had entered because Honour and Duty seemed imperatively to
call me.

<p/>I own I felt an inexpressible relief when I had come to the resolution
to retire and betake myself to the peaceful shade of my own vines and
fig-trees at home. I longed, however, to see my brother ere I returned,
and asked, and easily obtained an errand to the camp of the American
General Clinton from our own chief. The headquarters of his (<font color='blue'><b>Clinton</b></font>) division
were now some miles up the river, and a boat and a flag of truce quickly
brought me to the point where his (<font color='blue'><b>Clinton</b></font>) out-pickets received me on the shore.
My brother was very soon with me. He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) had only lately joined General
Clinton's division with letters from headquarters at Philadelphia, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Clinton</b></font>) chanced to hear, after the attack on Fort Clinton, that I had been
present during the affair. We passed a brief delightful night together:
Mr. Sady, who always followed Hal to the war, cooking a feast in honour
of both his (<font color='blue'><b>Sady</b></font>) masters. There was but one bed of straw in the hut where we
had quarters, and Hal and I slept on it, side by side, as we had done
when we were boys. We had a hundred things to say regarding past times
and present. His (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>) kind heart gladdened when I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>) of my resolve to
retire to my acres and to take off the red coat which I wore: he (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>) flung
his (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>) arms round it. <div class="bookquote">``Praised be God!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Oh, heavens, George!
think what might have happened had we met in the affair two nights ago!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>) turned quite pale at the thought. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>) eased my mind with respect
to our mother. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was a bitter Tory, to be sure, but the Chief had
given special injunctions regarding her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) safety. <div class="bookquote">``And Fanny''  (<font color='red'><b>Hal</b></font>)</div>-LRB-Hal's
wife-RRB- <div class="bookquote">``watches over her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) is as good as a company!''  (<font color='red'><b>Hal wife</b></font>)</div>cried the
enthusiastic husband. <div class="bookquote">``Isn't she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) clever? Isn't she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) handsome? Isn't
she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) good?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hal</b></font>)</div>cries Hal, never, fortunately, waiting for a reply to these
ardent queries. <div class="bookquote">``And to think that I was nearly marrying Maria once! Oh,
mercy, what an escape I had!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>) added. <div class="bookquote">``Hagan prays for the King, every
morning and night, at Castlewood, but they bolt the doors, and nobody
hears. Gracious powers! his (<font color='blue'><b>Hagan</b></font>) wife is sixty if she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) is a day; and oh,
George! the quantity she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) drinks is...''  (<font color='red'><b>cousin</b></font>)</div>But why tell the failings of our
good cousin? I am pleased to think she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) lived to drink the health of King
George long after his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) Old Dominion had passed for ever from his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) sceptre.

<p/>The morning came when my brief mission to the camp was ended, and the
truest of friends and fondest of brothers accompanied me to my boat,
which lay waiting at the riverside. We exchanged an embrace at parting,
and his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) hand held mine yet for a moment ere I stepped into the barge
which bore me rapidly down the stream. <div class="bookquote">``Shall I see thee once more,
dearest and best companion of my youth?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I thought. <div class="bookquote">``Amongst our cold
Englishmen, can I ever hope to meet with a friend like thee? When hadst
thou ever a thought that was not kindly and generous? When a wish, or
a possession, but for me you would sacrifice it? How brave are you,
and how modest; how gentle, and how strong; how simple, unselfish, and
humble; how eager to see others' merit; how diffident of your own!''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
stood on the shore till his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) figure grew dim before, me. There was that
in my eyes which prevented me from seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) longer.


<p/>Brilliant as Sir Henry's success had been, it was achieved, as usual,
too late: and served but as a small set-off against the disaster of
Burgoyne which ensued immediately, and which our advance was utterly
inadequate to relieve. More than one secret messenger was despatched to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Burgoyne</b></font>) who never reached him (<font color='blue'><b>Burgoyne</b></font>), and of whom we never learned the fate. Of
one wretch who offered to carry intelligence to him (<font color='blue'><b>Burgoyne</b></font>), and whom Sir
Henry despatched with a letter of his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) own, we heard the miserable
doom. Falling in with some of the troops of General George Clinton, who
happened to be in red uniform -LRB-part of the prize of a British ship's
cargo, doubtless, which had been taken by American privateers-RRB-, the spy
thought he (<font color='blue'><b>spy</b></font>) was in the English army, and advanced towards the sentries.
He (<font color='blue'><b>spy</b></font>) found his (<font color='blue'><b>spy</b></font>) mistake too late. His (<font color='blue'><b>spy</b></font>) letter was discovered upon him (<font color='blue'><b>spy</b></font>), and
he (<font color='blue'><b>spy</b></font>) had to die for bearing it. In ten days after the success at the Forts
occurred the great disaster at Saratoga, of which we carried the dismal
particulars in the fleet which bore us home. I am afraid my wife was
unable to mourn for it. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) children, her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) father, her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) sister to
revisit, and daily and nightly thanks to pay to Heaven that had brought
her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) husband safe out of danger.




<p/>CHAPTER XCII. Under Vine and Fig-Tree


<p/>Need I describe, young folks, the delights of the meeting at home,
and the mother's happiness with all her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) brood once more under her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) fond
wings? It was wrote in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) face, and acknowledged on her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) knees. Our
house was large enough for all, but Aunt Hetty would not stay in it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
said, fairly, that to resign her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) motherhood over the elder children, who
had been hers for nearly three years, cost her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) too great a pang; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
could not bear for yet a while to be with them, and to submit to take
only the second place. So she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) father went away to a house at
Bury St. Edmunds, not far from us, where they lived, and where she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
spoiled her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) eldest nephew and niece in private. It was the year after we
came home that Mr. B, the Jamaica planter, died, who left her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) the half
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) fortune; and then I heard, for the first time, how the worthy
gentleman had been greatly enamoured of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) in Jamaica, and, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
had refused him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>), had thus shown his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) constancy to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>). Heaven knows how
much property of Aunt Hetty's Monsieur Miles hath already devoured!
the price of his (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) commission and outfit; his (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) gorgeous uniforms; his (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>)
play-debts and little transactions in the Minories;--do you think,
sirrah, I do not know what human nature is; what is the cost of
Pall Mall taverns, petits soupers, play even in moderation--at the
Cocoa-Tree; and that a gentleman cannot purchase all these enjoyments
with the five hundred a year which I allow him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)? Aunt Hetty declares she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
has made up her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) mind to be an old maid. <div class="bookquote">``I made a vow never to marry
until I could find a man as good as my dear father,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``and I
never did, Sir George. No, my dearest Theo, not half as good; and Sir
George may put that in his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) pipe and smoke it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>And yet when the good General died -LRB-calm, and full of years, and glad to
depart-RRB-, I think it was my wife who shed the most tears. <div class="bookquote">``I weep because
I think I did not love him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) enough,''  (<font color='red'><b>the tender creature</b></font>)</div>said the tender creature: whereas
Hetty scarce departed from her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) calm, at least outwardly and before any
of us; talks of him (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) constantly still, as though he (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) were alive; recalls
his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) merry sayings, his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) gentle, kind ways with his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) children -LRB-when she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)
brightens up and looks herself quite a girl again-RRB-, and sits cheerfully
looking up to the slab in church which records his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) name and some of his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>)
virtues, and for once tells no lies.

<p/>I had fancied, sometimes, that my brother Hal, for whom Hetty had a
juvenile passion, always retained a hold of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) heart; and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>) came
to see us, ten years ago, I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>) of this childish romance of Het's,
with the hope, I own, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>) would ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) to replace Mrs. Fanny, who
had been gathered to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) fathers, and regarding whom my wife -LRB-with
her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) usual propensity to consider herself a miserable sinner-RRB- always
reproached herself, because, forsooth, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) did not regret Fanny enough.
Hal, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>) came to us, was plunged in grief about her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) loss; and vowed
that the world did not contain such another woman. Our dear old General,
who was still in life then, took him (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) in and housed him (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>), as he (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) had done
in the happy early days. The women played him (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) the very same tunes which
he (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) had heard when a boy at Oakhurst. Everybody's heart was very soft
with old recollections, and Harry never tired of pouring out his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) griefs
and his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) recitals of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wife's virtues to Het, and anon of talking
fondly about his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) dear Aunt Lambert, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) loved with all his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) heart,
and whose praises, you may be sure, were welcome to the faithful old
husband, out of whose thoughts his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) wife's memory was never, I believe,
absent for any three waking minutes of the day.

<p/>General Hal went to Paris as an American General Officer in his (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>) blue and
yellow -LRB-which Mr. Fox and other gentlemen had brought into fashion here
likewise-RRB-, and was made much of at Versailles, although he (<font color='blue'><b>Fox</b></font>) was presented
by Monsieur le Marquis de Lafayette to the Most Christian King and
Queen, who did not love Monsieur le Marquis. And I believe a Marquise
took a fancy to the Virginian General, and would have married him (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) out of
hand, had he (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) not resisted, and fled back to England and Warrington and
Bury again, especially to the latter place, where the folks would listen
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) talked about his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) late wife, with an endless patience and
sympathy. As for us, who had known the poor paragon, we were civil, but
not quite so enthusiastic regarding her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), and rather puzzled sometimes to
answer our children's questions about Uncle Hal's angel wife.

<p/>The two Generals and myself, and Captain Miles, and Parson Blake -LRB-who
was knocked over at Monmouth, the year after I left America, and came
home to change his (<font color='blue'><b>Blake</b></font>) coat, and take my living-RRB-, used to fight the battles
of the Revolution over our bottle; and the parson used to cry, <div class="bookquote">``By
Jupiter, General''  (<font color='red'><b>the parson</b></font>)</div>-LRB-he (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) compounded for Jupiter, when he (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) laid down his (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>)
military habit-RRB-, <div class="bookquote">``you are the Tory, and Sir George is the Whig! He (<font color='blue'><b>Tory</b></font>) is
always finding fault with our leaders, and you are for ever standing
up for them; and when I prayed for the King last Sunday, I heard you
following me quite loud.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And so I do, Blake, with all my heart; I can't forget I wore his (<font color='blue'><b>Blake</b></font>) coat,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hal</b></font>)</div>says Hal.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, if Wolfe had been alive for twenty years more!''  (<font color='red'><b>Hetty/Miss Hetty/Lambert</b></font>)</div>says Lambert.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hal</b></font>)</div>cries Hal, <div class="bookquote">``you should hear the General talk about him (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hal</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What General?''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>says I -LRB-to vex him (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>)-RRB-.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My General,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hal</b></font>)</div>says Hal, standing up, and filling a bumper. <div class="bookquote">``His (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>)
Excellency General George Washington!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``With all my heart,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>cry I, but the parson looks as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>) did not like
the toast or the claret.

<p/>Hal never tired in speaking of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>) General; and it was on some such
evening of friendly converse, that he (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) told us how he (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) had actually been
in disgrace with this General whom he (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) loved so fondly. Their difference
seems to have been about Monsieur le Marquis de Lafayette before
mentioned, who played such a fine part in history of late, and who hath
so suddenly disappeared out of it. His (<font color='blue'><b>Lafayette</b></font>) previous rank in our own service,
and his (<font color='blue'><b>Lafayette</b></font>) acknowledged gallantry during the war, ought to have secured
Colonel Warrington's promotion in the Continental army, where a
whipper-snapper like M. de Lafayette had but to arrive and straightway
to be complimented by Congress with the rank of Major-General. Hal,
with the freedom of an old soldier, had expressed himself somewhat
contemptuously regarding some of the appointments made by Congress, with
whom all sorts of miserable intrigues and cabals were set to work by
unscrupulous officers who were greedy of promotion. Mr. Warrington,
imitating perhaps in this the example of his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) now illustrious friend of
Mount Vernon, affected to make the war en gentilhomme took his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) pay, to
be sure, but spent it upon comforts and clothing for his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) men, and as for
rank, declared it was a matter of no earthly concern to him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>), and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>)
would as soon serve as colonel as in any higher grade. No doubt he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) added
contemptuous remarks regarding certain General Officers of Congress
army, their origin, and the causes of their advancement: notably he (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>)
was very angry about the sudden promotion of the young French lad just
named--the Marquis, as they loved to call him (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>)--in the Republican army,
and who, by the way, was a prodigious favourite of the Chief himself.
There were not three officers in the whole Continental force -LRB-after
poor madcap Lee was taken prisoner and disgraced-RRB- who could speak the
Marquis's language, so that Hal could judge the young Major-General
more closely and familiarly than other gentlemen, including the
Commander-in-Chief himself. Mr. Washington good-naturedly rated friend
Hal for being jealous of the beardless commander of Auvergne; was
himself not a little pleased by the filial regard and profound
veneration which the enthusiastic young nobleman always showed for
him (<font color='blue'><b>nobleman</b></font>); and had, moreover, the very best politic reasons for treating the
Marquis with friendship and favour.

<p/>Meanwhile, as it afterwards turned out, the Commander-in-Chief was most
urgently pressing Colonel Warrington's promotion upon Congress; and, as
if his (<font color='blue'><b>Commander-in-Chief</b></font>) difficulties before the enemy were not enough, he (<font color='blue'><b>Commander-in-Chief</b></font>) being at this
hard time of winter entrenched at Valley Forge, commanding five or
six thousand men at the most, almost without fire, blankets, food, or
ammunition, in the face of Sir William Howe's army, which was perfectly
appointed, and three times as numerous as his (<font color='blue'><b>Howe</b></font>) own; as if, I say, this
difficulty was not enough to try him (<font color='blue'><b>Howe</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Howe</b></font>) had further to encounter
the cowardly distrust of Congress, and insubordination and conspiracy
amongst the officers in his (<font color='blue'><b>Howe</b></font>) own camp. During the awful winter of `77,
when one blow struck by the sluggard at the head of the British forces
might have ended the war, and all was doubt, confusion, despair in the
opposite camp -LRB-save in one indomitable breast alone-RRB-, my brother had an
interview with the Chief, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Chief</b></font>) has subsequently described to me,
and of which Hal could never speak without giving way to the deepest
emotion. Mr. Washington had won no such triumph as that which the
dare-devil courage of Arnold and the elegant imbecility of Burgoyne
had procured for Gates and the northern army. Save in one or two minor
encounters, which proved how daring his (<font color='blue'><b>Gates</b></font>) bravery was, and how unceasing
his (<font color='blue'><b>Gates</b></font>) watchfulness, General Washington had met with defeat after defeat
from an enemy in all points his (<font color='blue'><b>Gates</b></font>) superior. The Congress mistrusted
him (<font color='blue'><b>Gates</b></font>). Many an officer in his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) own camp hated him (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>). Those who had been
disappointed in ambition, those who had been detected in peculation,
those whose selfishness or incapacity his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) honest eyes had spied
out,--were all more, or less in league against him (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>). Gates was the chief
towards whom the malcontents turned. Mr. Gates was the only genius fit
to conduct the war; and with a vaingloriousness, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Gates</b></font>) afterwards
generously owned, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gates</b></font>) did not refuse the homage which was paid him (<font color='blue'><b>Gates</b></font>).

<p/>To show how dreadful were the troubles and anxieties with which General
Washington had to contend, I may mention what at this time was called
the <div class="bookquote">``Conway Cabal.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>A certain Irishman--a Chevalier of St. Louis, and an
officer in the French service--arrived in America early in the year `77
in quest of military employment. He (<font color='blue'><b>Louis</b></font>) was speedily appointed to the rank
of brigadier, and could not be contented, forsooth, without an immediate
promotion to be major-general.

<p/>Mr. C. had friends at Congress, who, as the General-in-Chief was
informed, had promised him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) speedy promotion. General Washington
remonstrated, representing the injustice of promoting to the highest
rank the youngest brigadier in the service; and whilst the matter was
pending, was put in possession of a letter from Conway to General Gates,
whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Gates</b></font>) complimented, saying, that <div class="bookquote">``Heaven had been determined to save
America, or a weak general and bad councillors would have ruined it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>The General enclosed the note to Mr. Conway, without a word of comment;
and Conway offered his (<font color='blue'><b>Conway</b></font>) resignation, which was refused by Congress,
who appointed him (<font color='blue'><b>Conway</b></font>) Inspector-General of the army, with the rank of
Major-General.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And it was at this time,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div>says Harry -LRB-with many passionate exclamations
indicating his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) rage with himself and his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) admiration of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) leader-RRB-,
``when, by heavens, the glorious Chief was oppressed by troubles enough
to drive ten thousand men mad--that I must interfere with my jealousies
about the Frenchman! I had not said much, only some nonsense to Greene
and Cadwalader about getting some frogs against the Frenchman came to
dine with us, and having a bagful of Marquises over from Paris, as we
were not able to command ourselves;--but I should have known the Chief's
troubles, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Chief</b></font>) had a better head than mine, and might have had
the grace to hold my tongue.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``For a while the General said nothing, but I could remark, by the
coldness of his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) demeanour, that something had occurred to create a
schism between him (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) and me. Mrs. Washington, who had come to camp, also
saw that something was wrong. Women have artful ways of soothing men and
finding their secrets out. I am not sure that I should have ever tried
to learn the cause of the General's displeasure, for I am as proud as
he (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) is, and besides''  (<font color='red'><b>Hal</b></font>)</div>-LRB-says Hal-RRB-, <div class="bookquote">``when the Chief is angry, it was not
pleasant coming near him (<font color='blue'><b>Chief</b></font>), I can promise you.''  (<font color='red'><b>Hal</b></font>)</div>My brother was indeed
subjugated by his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) old friend, and obeyed him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) and bowed before him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) as a
boy before a schoolmaster.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``At last,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hal</b></font>)</div>Hal resumed, ``Mrs. Washington found out the mystery.
`Speak to me after dinner, Colonel Hal,' says she (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>). `Come out to the
parade-ground, before the dining-house, and I will tell you all.' I
left a half-score of general officers and brigadiers drinking round the
General's table, and found Mrs. Washington waiting for me. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>) then told
me it was the speech I had made about the box of Marquises, with which
the General was offended. `I should not have heeded it in another,'
he (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) had said, `but I never thought Harry Warrington would have joined
against me.'

<p/>``I had to wait on him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) for the word that night, and found him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) alone at
his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) table. `Can your Excellency give me five minutes' time?' I said,
with my heart in my mouth. `Yes, surely, sir,' says he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>), pointing to the
other chair. `Will you please to be seated?'

<p/>```It used not always to be Sir and Colonel Warrington, between me and
your Excellency,' I said.

<p/>``He (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) said, calmly, `The times are altered.'

<p/>```Et nos mutamur in illis,' says I. `Times and people are both changed.'

<p/>```You had some business with me?' he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) asked.

<p/>```Am I speaking to the Commander-in-Chief or to my old friend?' I asked.

<p/>``He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) looked at me gravely. `Well,--to both, sir,' he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) said. `Pray sit,
Harry.'

<p/>```If to General Washington, I tell his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) Excellency that I, and many
officers of this army, are not well pleased to see a boy of twenty made
a major-general over us, because he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) is a Marquis, and because he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) can't
speak the English language. If I speak to my old friend, I have to say
that he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) has shown me very little of trust or friendship for the last
few weeks; and that I have no desire to sit at your table, and have
impertinent remarks made by others there, of the way in which his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)
Excellency turns his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) back on me.'

<p/>```Which charge shall I take first, Harry?' he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) asked, turning his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) chair
away from the table, and crossing his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) legs as if ready for a talk. `You
are jealous, as I gather, about the Marquis?'

<p/>```Jealous, sir!' says I. `An aide-de-camp of Mr. Wolfe is not jealous of
a Jack-a-dandy who, five years ago, was being whipped at school!'

<p/>```You yourself declined higher rank than that which you hold,' says the
Chief, turning a little red.

<p/>```But I never bargained to have a macaroni Marquis to command me!' I
cried. `I will not, for one, carry the young gentleman's orders; and
since Congress and your Excellency chooses to take your generals out
of the nursery, I shall humbly ask leave to resign, and retire to my
plantation.'

<p/>```Do, Harry; that is true friendship!' says the Chief, with a gentleness
that surprised me. `Now that your old friend is in a difficulty, `tis
surely the best time to leave him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>).'

<p/>```Sir!' says I.

<p/>```Do as so many of the rest are doing, Mr. Warrington. Et tu, Brute,
as the play says. Well, well, Harry! I did not think it of you; but, at
least, you are in the fashion.'

<p/>```You asked which charge you should take first?' I said.

<p/>```Ch, the promotion of the Marquis? I recommended the appointment to
Congress, no doubt; and you and other gentlemen disapprove it.'

<p/>```I have spoken for myself, sir,' says I.

<p/>```If you take me in that tone, Colonel Warrington, I have nothing to
answer!' says the Chief, rising up very fiercely; `and presume that
I can recommend officers for promotion without asking your previous
sanction.'

<p/>```Being on that tone, sir,' says I, `let me respectfully offer my
resignation to your Excellency, founding my desire to resign upon the
fact, that Congress, at your Excellency's recommendation, offers its
highest commands to boys of twenty, who are scarcely even acquainted
with our language.' And I rise up and make his (<font color='blue'><b>Chief</b></font>) Excellency a bow.

<p/>```Great heavens, Harry!' he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) cries---LRB-about this Marquis's appointment he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>)
was beaten, that was the fact, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) could not reply to me-RRB-, `can't you
believe that in this critical time of our affairs, there are reasons why
special favours should be shown to the first Frenchman of distinction
who comes amongst us?'

<p/>```No doubt, sir. If your Excellency acknowledges that Monsieur de
Lafayette's merits have nothing to do with the question.'

<p/>```I acknowledge or deny nothing, sir!' says the General, with a stamp of
his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) foot, and looking as though he (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) could be terribly angry if he (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) would.
`Am I here to be catechised by you? Stay. Hark, Harry! I speak to you as
a man of the world--nay, as an old friend. This appointment humiliates
you and others, you say? Be it so! Must we not bear humiliation, along
with the other burthens and griefs, for the sake of our country? It is
no more just perhaps that the Marquis should be set over you gentlemen,
than that your Prince Ferdinand or your Prince of Wales at home should
have a command over veterans. But if in appointing this young nobleman
we please a whole nation, and bring ourselves twenty millions of allies,
will you and other gentlemen sulk because we do him (<font color='blue'><b>nobleman</b></font>) honour? `Tis easy to
sneer at him (<font color='blue'><b>nobleman</b></font>) -LRB-though, believe me, the Marquis has many more merits
than you allow him (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>)-RRB-; to my mind it were more generous, as well as more
polite, of Harry Warrington to welcome this stranger for the sake of the
prodigious benefit our country may draw from him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>)--not to laugh at his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>)
peculiarities, but to aid him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) and help his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) ignorance by your experience
as an old soldier: that is what I would do--that is the part I expected
of thee--for it is the generous and manly one, Harry: but you choose
to join my enemies, and when I am in trouble you say you will leave me.
That is why I have been hurt: that is why I have been cold. I thought
I might count on your friendship--and--and you can tell whether I was
right or no. I relied on you as on a brother, and you come and tell me
you will resign. Be it so! Being embarked in this contest, by God's will
I will see it to an end. You are not the first, Mr. Warrington, has left
me on the way.'

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) spoke with so much tenderness, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) spoke his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) face wore such a
look of unhappiness, that an extreme remorse and pity seized me, and I
called out I know not what incoherent expressions regarding old times,
and vowed that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) would say the word, I never would leave him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>). You
never loved him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>), George,''  (<font color='red'><b>brother</b></font>)</div>says my brother, turning to me, <div class="bookquote">``but I did
beyond all mortal men; and, though I am not clever like you, I think my
instinct was in the right. He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) has a greatness not approached by other
men''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't say no, brother,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, <div class="bookquote">``now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Greatness, pooh!''  (<font color='red'><b>the parson</b></font>)</div>says the parson, growling over his (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) wine.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We walked into Mrs. Washington's tea-room arm-in-arm,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hal</b></font>)</div>Hal resumed;
``she (<font color='blue'><b>men</b></font>) looked up quite kind, and saw we were friends. `Is it all over,
Colonel Harry?' she (<font color='blue'><b>men</b></font>) whispered. `I know he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) has applied ever so often
about your promotion--'

<p/>```I never will take it,' says I. And that is how I came to do penance,''
says Harry, telling me the story, <div class="bookquote">``with Lafayette the next winter.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>-LRB-Hal
could imitate the Frenchman very well.-RRB- ```I will go weez heem,' says I.
`I know the way to Quebec, and when we are not in action with Sir Guy, I
can hear his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) Excellency the Major-General say his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) lesson.' There was no
fight, you know we could get no army to act in Canada, and returned to
headquarters; and what do you think disturbed the Frenchman most? The
idea that people would laugh at him (<font color='blue'><b>Frenchman</b></font>), because his (<font color='blue'><b>Frenchman</b></font>) command had come to
nothing. And so they did laugh at him (<font color='blue'><b>Frenchman</b></font>), and almost to his (<font color='blue'><b>Frenchman</b></font>) face too, and
who could help it? If our Chief had any weak point it was this Marquis.

<p/>``After our little difference we became as great friends as before--if
a man may be said to be friends with a Sovereign Prince, for as such I
somehow could not help regarding the General: and one night, when we
had sate the company out, we talked of old times, and the jolly days of
sport we had together both before and after Braddock's; and that pretty
duel you were near having when we were boys. He (<font color='blue'><b>Braddock</b></font>) laughed about it, and
said he (<font color='blue'><b>Braddock</b></font>) never saw a man look more wicked and more bent on killing than
you did: `And to do Sir George justice, I think he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) has hated me ever
since,' says the Chief. `Ah!' he (<font color='blue'><b>Chief</b></font>) added, `an open enemy I can face
readily enough. `Tis the secret foe who causes the doubt and anguish! We
have sat with more than one at my table to-day, to whom I am obliged to
show a face of civility, whose hands I must take when they are offered,
though I know they are stabbing my reputation, and are eager to pull me
down from my place. You spoke but lately of being humiliated because a
junior was set over you in command. What humiliation is yours compared
to mine, who have to play the farce of welcome to these traitors; who
have to bear the neglect of Congress, and see men who have insulted me
promoted in my own army? If I consulted my own feelings as a man, would
I continue in this command? You know whether my temper is naturally warm
or not, and whether as a private gentleman I should be likely to
suffer such slights and outrages as are put upon me daily; but in the
advancement of the sacred cause in which we are engaged, we have to
endure not only hardship and danger, but calumny and wrong, and may God
give us strength to do our duty!' And then the General showed me
the papers regarding the affair of that fellow Conway, whom Congress
promoted in spite of the intrigue, and down whose black throat John
Cadwalader sent the best ball he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) ever fired in his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) life.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And it was here,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hal</b></font>)</div>said Hal, concluding his (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>) story, ``as I looked at the
Chief talking at night in the silence of the camp, and remembered how
lonely he (<font color='blue'><b>Chief</b></font>) was, what an awful responsibility he (<font color='blue'><b>Chief</b></font>) carried, how spies and
traitors were eating out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Chief</b></font>) dish, and an enemy lay in front of him (<font color='blue'><b>Chief</b></font>)
who might at any time overpower him (<font color='blue'><b>Chief</b></font>), that I thought, `Sure, this is the
greatest man now in the world; and what a wretch I am to think of my
jealousies and annoyances, whilst he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is walking serenely under his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
immense cares!'''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We talked but now of Wolfe,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I. <div class="bookquote">``Here, indeed, is a greater than

gained--who can say this is not greatness, or show the other Englishman
who has achieved so much?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You and I thought scarlet most becoming to our complexion, Joe Blake!''
 (<font color='red'><b>George/Mr. Warrington/Mr. George</b></font>)</div>says Sir George. <div class="bookquote">``And my wife thinks there would not have been room for

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Warrington/Esmond</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry burst into a roar of laughter -LRB-in which, of course, Mr. Miles must
join his (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) uncle-RRB-.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>says he (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``it's a fact that Hagan read one at my house to the

asleep!''

her (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) head, <div class="bookquote">``and `tis all the more magnanimous of Sir George to speak so
well of him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Theo/Lady Theo</b></font>)</div><p/>And then Hal told how, his (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>) battles over, his (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>) country freed, his (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>) great
work of liberation complete, the General laid down his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) victorious sword,
and met his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) comrades of the army in a last adieu. The last
British soldier had quitted the shore of the Republic, and the
Commander-in-Chief proposed to leave New York for Annapolis, where
Congress was sitting, and there resign his (<font color='blue'><b>Commander-in-Chief</b></font>) commission. About noon, on
the 4th December, a barge was in waiting at Whitehall Ferry to convey
him (<font color='blue'><b>Commander-in-Chief</b></font>) across the Hudson. The chiefs of the army assembled at a tavern near
the ferry, and there the General joined them. Seldom as he (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) showed his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>)
emotion, outwardly, on this day he (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) could not disguise it. He (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) filled a
glass of wine, and said, `I bid you farewell with a heart full of love
and gratitude, and wish your latter days may be as prosperous and happy
as those past have been glorious and honourable.' Then he (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) drank to them.
`I cannot come to each of you to take my leave,' he (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) said, `but shall be
obliged if you will each come and shake me by the hand.'

<p/>General Knox, who was nearest, came forward, and the Chief, with tears
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Chief</b></font>) eyes, embraced him (<font color='blue'><b>Chief</b></font>). The others came, one by one, to him (<font color='blue'><b>Chief</b></font>), and
took their leave without a word. A line of infantry was formed from the
tavern to the ferry, and the General, with his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) officers following him (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>),
walked silently to the water. He (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) stood up in the barge, taking off his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>)
hat, and waving a farewell. And his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) comrades remained bareheaded on the
shore till their leader's boat was out of view.

<p/>As Harry speaks very low, in the grey of evening, with sometimes a break
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) voice, we all sit touched and silent. Hetty goes up and kisses
her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) father.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You tell us of others, General Harry,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) says, passing a handkerchief
across her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) eyes, <div class="bookquote">``of Marion and Sumpter, of Greene and Wayne, and Rawdon
and Cornwallis, too, but you never mention Colonel Warrington!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear, he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) will tell you his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) story in private!''  (<font color='red'><b>whispers wife</b></font>)</div>whispers my wife,
clinging to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) sister, <div class="bookquote">``and you can write it for him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div><p/>But it was not to be. My Lady Theo, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>) husband too, I own, catching
the infection from her (<font color='blue'><b>Theo</b></font>), never would let Harry rest, until we had coaxed,
wheedled, and ordered him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) to ask Hetty in marriage. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) obeyed, and it
was she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) who now declined. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Marion</b></font>) had always,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``the truest regard

take him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Marion</b></font>) hoped she (<font color='blue'><b>Marion</b></font>) would be too old to think of bearing any other
name but her (<font color='blue'><b>Marion</b></font>) own. Harry should have her (<font color='blue'><b>Marion</b></font>) love always as the best of
brothers; and as George and Theo have such a nurseryful of children,''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>adds Hester, <div class="bookquote">``we must show our love to them, by saving for the young
ones.''  (<font color='red'><b>Hester/Miss Hester/Miss Hester Lambert</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Hester</b></font>) sent him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>Hester</b></font>) answer in writing, leaving home on a visit to
friends at a distance, as though she (<font color='blue'><b>Hester</b></font>) would have him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) to understand that
her (<font color='blue'><b>Hester</b></font>) decision was final. As such Hal received it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>) did not break his (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>)
heart. Cupid's arrows, ladies, don't bite very deep into the tough skins
of gentlemen of our age; though, to be sure, at the time of which I
write, my brother was still a young man, being little more than fifty.
Aunt Het is now a staid little lady with a voice of which years have
touched the sweet chords, and a head which Time has powdered over with
silver. There are days when she (<font color='blue'><b>Het</b></font>) looks surprisingly young and blooming.
Ah me, my dear, it seems but a little while since the hair was golden
brown, and the cheeks as fresh as roses! And then came the bitter blast
of love unrequited which withered them; and that long loneliness of
heart which, they say, follows. Why should Theo and I have been so
happy, and thou so lonely? Why should my meal be garnished with love,
and spread with plenty, while yon solitary outcast shivers at my gate? I
bow my head humbly before the Dispenser of pain and poverty, wealth and
health; I feel sometimes as if, for the prizes which have fallen to the
lot of me unworthy, I did not dare to be grateful. But I hear the voices
of my children in their garden, or look up at their mother from my book,
or perhaps my sick-bed, and my heart fills with instinctive gratitude
towards the bountiful Heaven that has so blest me.


<p/>Since my accession to my uncle's title and estate my intercourse with
my good cousin Lord Castlewood had been very rare. I had always supposed
him (<font color='blue'><b>Castlewood</b></font>) to be a follower of the winning side in politics, and was not a
little astonished to hear of his (<font color='blue'><b>Castlewood</b></font>) sudden appearance in opposition. A
disappointment in respect to a place at court, of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Castlewood</b></font>) pretended to
have had some promise, was partly the occasion of his (<font color='blue'><b>Castlewood</b></font>) rupture with the
Ministry. It is said that the most August Person in the realm had flatly
refused to receive into the R-y-l Household a nobleman whose character
was so notoriously bad, and whose example -LRB-so the August Objector was
pleased to say-RRB- would ruin and corrupt any respectable family. I heard
of the Castlewoods during our travels in Europe, and that the mania for
play had again seized upon his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) lordship. His (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) impaired fortunes having
been retrieved by the prudence of his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) wife and father-in-law, he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) had
again begun to dissipate his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) income at hombre and lansquenet. There
were tales of malpractices in which he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) had been discovered, and even of
chastisement inflicted upon him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) by the victims of his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) unscrupulous
arts. His (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) wife's beauty and freshness faded early; we met but once at
Aix-la-Chapelle, where Lady Castlewood besought my wife to go and
see her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>), and afflicted Lady Warrington's kind heart by stories of the
neglect and outrage of which her (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) unfortunate husband was guilty. We were
willing to receive these as some excuse and palliation for the unhappy
lady's own conduct. A notorious adventurer, gambler, and spadassin,
calling himself the Chevalier de Barry, and said to be a relative of
the mistress of the French King, but afterwards turning out to be an
Irishman of low extraction, was in constant attendance upon the Earl and
Countess at this time, and conspicuous for the audacity of his (<font color='blue'><b>Earl</b></font>) lies, the
extravagance of his (<font color='blue'><b>Earl</b></font>) play, and somewhat mercenary gallantry towards the
other sex, and a ferocious bravo courage, which, however, failed him (<font color='blue'><b>Earl</b></font>)
on one or two awkward occasions, if common report said true. He (<font color='blue'><b>Earl</b></font>)
subsequently married, and rendered miserable a lady of title and fortune
in England. The poor little American lady's interested union with Lord
Castlewood was scarcely more happy.

<p/>I remember our little Miles's infantile envy being excited by learning
that Lord Castlewood's second son, a child a few months younger than
himself, was already an ensign on the Irish establishment, whose pay the
fond parents regularly drew. This piece of preferment my lord must have
got for his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) cadet whilst he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) was on good terms with the Minister, during
which period of favour Will Esmond was also shifted off to New York.
Whilst I was in America myself, we read in an English journal that
Captain Charles Esmond had resigned his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) commission in his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) Majesty's
service, as not wishing to take up arms against the countrymen of his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
mother, the Countess of Castlewood. <div class="bookquote">``It is the doing of the old fox, Van
den Bosch,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madam Esmond/Madam Esmond Warrington/Madam Warrington</b></font>)</div>Madam Esmond said; <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Bosch</b></font>) wishes to keep his (<font color='blue'><b>Bosch</b></font>) Virginian property
safe, whatever side should win!''  (<font color='red'><b>Madam Esmond/Madam Esmond Warrington/Madam Warrington</b></font>)</div>I may mention, with respect to this
old worthy, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) continued to reside in England for a while after the
Declaration of Independence, not at all denying his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) sympathy with the
American cause, but keeping a pretty quiet tongue, and alleging that
such a very old man as himself was past the age of action or mischief,
in which opinion the Government concurred, no doubt, as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was left
quite unmolested. But of a sudden a warrant was out after him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), when it
was surprising with what agility he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stirred himself, and skipped off to
France, whence he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) presently embarked upon his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) return to Virginia.

<p/>The old man bore the worst reputation amongst the Loyalists of our
colony; and was nicknamed <div class="bookquote">``Jack the Painter''  (<font color='red'><b>the Loyalists</b></font>)</div>amongst them, much to
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) indignation, after a certain miscreant who was hung in England
for burning naval stores in our ports there. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) professed to have
lost prodigious sums at home by the persecution of the Government,
distinguished himself by the loudest patriotism and the most violent
religious outcries in Virginia; where, nevertheless, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was not much
more liked by the Whigs than by the party who still remained faithful
to the Crown. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wondered that such an old Tory as Madam Esmond of
Castlewood was suffered to go at large, and was for ever crying out
against her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) amongst the gentlemen of the new Assembly, the Governor, and
officers of the State. He (<font color='blue'><b>Governor</b></font>) and Fanny had high words in Richmond one
day, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) told him (<font color='blue'><b>Governor</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Governor</b></font>) was an old swindler and traitor, and that the
mother of Colonel Henry Warrington, the bosom friend of his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) Excellency
the Commander-in-Chief, was not to be insulted by such a little
smuggling slave-driver as him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>)! I think it was in the year 1780 an
accident happened, when the old Register Office at Williamsburg was
burned down, in which there was a copy of the formal assignment of the
Virginia property from Francis Lord Castlewood to my grandfather Henry
Esmond, Esquire. <div class="bookquote">``Oh,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Lady Fanny</b></font>)</div>says Fanny, <div class="bookquote">``of course this is the work of Jack
the Painter!''  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Lady Fanny</b></font>)</div>And Mr. Van den Bosch was for prosecuting her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) for libel,
but that Fanny took to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) bed at this juncture, and died.

<p/>Van den Bosch made contracts with the new Government, and sold them
bargains, as the phrase is. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bosch</b></font>) supplied horses, meat, forage, all of bad
quality; but when Arnold came into Virginia -LRB-in the King's service-RRB- and
burned right and left, Van den Bosch's stores and tobacco-houses somehow
were spared. Some secret Whigs now took their revenge on the old rascal.
A couple of his (<font color='blue'><b>rascal</b></font>) ships in James River, his (<font color='blue'><b>rascal</b></font>) stores, and a quantity of his (<font color='blue'><b>rascal</b></font>)
cattle in their stalls were roasted amidst a hideous bellowing; and
he (<font color='blue'><b>rascal</b></font>) got a note, as he (<font color='blue'><b>rascal</b></font>) was in Arnold's company, saying that friends
had served him (<font color='blue'><b>rascal</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>rascal</b></font>) served others; and containing <div class="bookquote">``Tom the Glazier's
compliments to brother Jack the Painter.''  (<font color='red'><b>others</b></font>)</div>Nobody pitied the old man,
though he (<font color='blue'><b>rascal</b></font>) went well-nigh mad at his (<font color='blue'><b>rascal</b></font>) loss. In Arnold's suite came
the Honourable Captain William Esmond, of the New York Loyalists, as
aide-de-camp to the General. When Howe occupied Philadelphia, Will was
said to have made some money keeping a gambling-house with an officer
of the dragoons of Anspach. I know not how he (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) lost it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) could not have
had much when he (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) consented to become an aide-de-camp of Arnold.

<p/>Now, the King's officers having reappeared in the province, Madam Esmond
thought fit to open her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) house at Castlewood and invite them thither--and
actually received Mr. Arnold and his (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>) suite. <div class="bookquote">``It is not for me,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>)
said, <div class="bookquote">``to refuse my welcome to a man whom my Sovereign has admitted to
grace.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) threw her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) house open to him (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>), and treated him (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>) with great
though frigid respect whilst he (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>) remained in the district. The General
gone, and, his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) precious aide-de-camp with him (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>), some of the rascals who
followed in their suite remained behind in the house where they had
received so much hospitality, insulted the old lady in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) hall,
insulted her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) people, and finally set fire to the old mansion in a frolic
of drunken fury. Our house at Richmond was not burned, luckily, though
Mr. Arnold had fired the town; and thither the undaunted old lady
proceeded, surrounded by her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) people, and never swerving in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) loyalty,
in spite of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) ill-usage. <div class="bookquote">``The Esmonds,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``were accustomed to
Royal ingratitude.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>And now Mr. Van den Bosch, in the name of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bosch</b></font>) grandson and my Lord
Castlewood, in England, set up a claim to our property in Virginia.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Bosch</b></font>) said it was not my lord's intention to disturb Madam Esmond in her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>)
enjoyment of the estate during her (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) life, but that his (<font color='blue'><b>Bosch</b></font>) father, it had
always been understood, had given his (<font color='blue'><b>Bosch</b></font>) kinsman a life-interest in the
place, and only continued it to his (<font color='blue'><b>Bosch</b></font>) daughter out of generosity. Now my
lord proposed that his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) second son should inhabit Virginia, for which
the young gentleman had always shown the warmest sympathy. The outcry
against Van den Bosch was so great that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bosch</b></font>) would have been tarred and
feathered, had he (<font color='blue'><b>Bosch</b></font>) remained in Virginia. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bosch</b></font>) betook himself to Congress,
represented himself as a martyr ruined in the cause of liberty, and
prayed for compensation for himself and justice for his (<font color='blue'><b>Bosch</b></font>) grandson.

<p/>My mother lived long in dreadful apprehension, having in truth a secret,
which she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) did not like to disclose to any one. Her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) titles were burned!
the deed of assignment in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) own house, the copy in the Registry at
Richmond, had alike been destroyed--by chance? by villainy? who could
say? She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) did not like to confide this trouble in writing to me.
She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) opened herself to Hal, after the surrender of York Town, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>)
acquainted me with the fact in a letter by a British officer returning
home on his (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>) parole. Then I remembered the unlucky words I had let slip
before Will Esmond at the coffee-house at New York; and a part of this
iniquitous scheme broke upon me.

<p/>As for Mr. Will: there is a tablet in Castlewood Church, in Hampshire,
inscribed, Dulce et decorum est pro patria mori, and announcing that
<div class="bookquote">``This marble is placed by a mourning brother, to the memory of the
Honourable William Esmond, Esquire, who died in North America, in the
service of his (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) King.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Will/Will/Will Esmond</b></font>)</div>But how? When, towards the end of 1781, a revolt
took place in the Philadelphia Line of the Congress Army, and Sir Henry
Clinton sent out agents to the mutineers, what became of them? The men
took the spies prisoners, and proceeded to judge them, and my brother
-LRB-whom they knew and loved, and had often followed under fire-RRB-, who had
been sent from camp to make terms with the troops, recognised one of the
spies, just as execution was about to be done upon him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)--and the wretch,
with horrid outcries, grovelling and kneeling at Colonel Warrington's
feet, besought him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) for mercy, and promised to confess all to him (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>). To
confess what? Harry turned away sick at heart. Will's mother and sister
never knew the truth. They always fancied it was in action he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was
killed.

<p/>As for my lord earl, whose noble son has been the intendant of an
illustrious Prince, and who has enriched himself at play with his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) R--l
master: I went to see his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) lordship when I heard of this astounding
design against our property, and remonstrated with him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) on the matter.
For myself, as I showed him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>), I was not concerned, as I had determined
to cede my right to my brother. He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) received me with perfect courtesy;
smiled when I spoke of my disinterestedness; said he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) was sure of my
affectionate feelings towards my brother, but what must be his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) towards
his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) son? He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) had always heard from his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) father: he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) would take his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) Bible
oath of that: that, at my mother's death, the property would return to
the head of the family. At the story of the title which Colonel Esmond
had ceded, he (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) shrugged his (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) shoulders, and treated it as a fable. <div class="bookquote">``On
ne fait pas de ces folies la!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>says he (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>), offering me snuff, <div class="bookquote">``and your
grandfather was a man of esprit! My little grandmother was eprise of
him (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>): and my father, the most good-natured soul alive, lent them the
Virginian property to get them out of the way! C’etoit un scandale, mon
cher, un joli petit scandale!''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>Oh, if my mother had but heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>)! I
might have been disposed to take a high tone: but he (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) said, with the
utmost good-nature, <div class="bookquote">``My dear Knight, are you going to fight about the
character of our grandmother? Allons donc! Come, I will be fair with
you! We will compromise, if you like, about this Virginian property!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and his (<font color='blue'><b>Esmond</b></font>) lordship named a sum greater than the actual value of the
estate.

<p/>Amazed at the coolness of this worthy, I walked away to my coffee-house,
where, as it happened, an old friend was to dine with me, for whom I
have a sincere regard. I had felt a pang at not being able to give this
gentleman my living of Warrington--on-Waveney, but I could not, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>)
himself confessed honestly. His (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) life had been too loose, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) example
in my village could never have been edifying: besides, he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) would have
died of ennui there, after being accustomed to a town life; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) had
a prospect finally, he (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) told me, of settling himself most comfortably in
London and the church. -LSB-He (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) was the second Incumbent of Lady Whittlesea's
Chapel, Mayfair, and married Elizabeth, relict of Hermann Voelcker,
Esq., the eminent brewer.-RSB- My guest, I need not say, was my old friend
Sampson, who never failed to dine with me when I came to town, and I
told him (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) of my interview with his (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) old patron.

<p/>I could not have lighted upon a better confidant. <div class="bookquote">``Gracious powers!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sampson/Mr. Sampson</b></font>)</div>says Sampson, <div class="bookquote">``the man's roguery beats all belief! When I was secretary
and factotum at Castlewood, I can take my oath I saw more than once a
copy of the deed of assignment by the late lord to your grandfather:
`In consideration of the love I bear to my kinsman Henry Esmond,
Esq., husband of my dear mother Rachel, Lady Viscountess Dowager of
Castlewood, I, etc.'--so it ran. I know the place where `tis kept--let
us go thither as fast as horses will carry us to-morrow. There is
somebody there--never mind whom, Sir George--who has an old regard for
me. The papers may be there to this very day, and O Lord, O Lord, but I
shall be thankful if I can in any way show my gratitude to you and your
glorious brother!''  (<font color='red'><b>Sampson/Mr. Sampson</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) eyes filled with tears. He (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) was an altered man.
At a certain period of the port wine Sampson always alluded with
compunction to his (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) past life, and the change which had taken place in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) conduct since the awful death of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) friend Doctor Dodd.

<p/>Quick as we were, we did not arrive at Castlewood too soon. I was
looking at the fountain in the court, and listening to that sweet sad
music of its plashing, which my grandfather tells of in his (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) memoires,
and peopling the place with bygone figures, with Beatrix in her (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrix</b></font>) beauty;
with my Lord Francis in scarlet, calling to his (<font color='blue'><b>Francis</b></font>) dogs and mounting
his (<font color='blue'><b>Francis</b></font>) grey horse; with the young page of old who won the castle and the
heiress--when Sampson comes running down to me with an old volume in
rough calf-bound in his (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) hand, containing drafts of letters, copies
of agreements, and various writings, some by a secretary of my Lord
Francis, some in the slim handwriting of his (<font color='blue'><b>Francis</b></font>) wife my grandmother, some
bearing the signature of the last lord; and here was a copy of the
assignment sure enough, as it had been sent to my grandfather in
Virginia. <div class="bookquote">``Victoria, Victoria!''  (<font color='red'><b>Sampson/Mr. Sampson</b></font>)</div>cries Sampson, shaking my hand,
embracing everybody. <div class="bookquote">``Here is a guinea for thee, Betty. We'll have a
bowl of punch at the Three Castles to-night!''  (<font color='red'><b>a couple</b></font>)</div>As we were talking, the
wheels of postchaises were heard, and a couple of carriages drove into
the court containing my lord and a friend, and their servants in the
next vehicle. His (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) lordship looked only a little paler than usual at
seeing me.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What procures me the honour of Sir George Warrington's visit, and
pray, Mr. Sampson, what do you do here?''  (<font color='red'><b>lord</b></font>)</div>says my lord. I think he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) had
forgotten the existence of this book, or had never seen it; and when he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>)
offered to take his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) Bible oath of what he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) had heard from his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) father, had
simply volunteered a perjury.

<p/>I was shaking hands with his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) companion, a nobleman with whom I had had
the honour to serve in America. <div class="bookquote">``I came,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said, <div class="bookquote">``to convince myself of
a fact, about which you were mistaken yesterday; and I find the proof
in your lordship's own house. Your lordship was pleased to take your
lordship's Bible oath, that there was no agreement between your father
and his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) mother, relative to some property which I hold. When Mr. Sampson
was your lordship's secretary, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) perfectly remembered having seen a
copy of such an assignment, and here it is.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And do you mean, Sir George Warrington, that unknown to me you have
been visiting my papers?''  (<font color='red'><b>lord</b></font>)</div>cries my lord.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I doubted the correctness of your statement, though backed by your
lordship's Bible oath,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said with a bow.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This, sir, is robbery! Give the papers back!''  (<font color='red'><b>lord</b></font>)</div>bawled my lord.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Robbery is a rough word, my lord. Shall I tell the whole story to Lord
Rawdon?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What, is it about the Marquisate? Connu, connu, my dear Sir George! We
always called you the Marquis in New York. I don't know who brought the
story from Virginia.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I never had heard this absurd nickname before, and did not care
to notice it. <div class="bookquote">``My Lord Castlewood,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said, <div class="bookquote">``not only doubted, but
yesterday laid a claim to my property, taking his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) Bible oath that--''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Castlewood gave a kind of gasp, and then said, <div class="bookquote">``Great heaven! Do you
mean, Sir George, that there actually is an agreement extant? Yes. Here
it is--my father's handwriting, sure enough! Then the question is clear.
Upon my o--well, upon my honour as a gentleman! I never knew of such
an agreement, and must have been mistaken in what my father said. This
paper clearly shows the property is yours: and not being mine--why, I
wish you joy of it!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) held out his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) hand with the blandest smile.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And how thankful you will be to me, my lord, for having enabled him (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) to
establish the right,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sampson/Mr. Sampson</b></font>)</div>says Sampson, with a leer on his (<font color='blue'><b>Sampson</b></font>) face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thankful? No, confound you. Not in the least!''  (<font color='red'><b>lord</b></font>)</div>says my lord. <div class="bookquote">``I am a
plain man; I don't disguise from my cousin that I would rather have
had the property than he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>). Sir George, you will stay and dine with us.
A large party is coming down here shooting; we ought to have you one of
us!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My lord,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, buttoning the book under my coat, <div class="bookquote">``I will go and get
this document copied, and then return it to your lordship. As my mother
in Virginia has had her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) papers burned, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) will be put out of much
anxiety by having this assignment safely lodged.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What, have Madam Esmond's papers been burned? When the deuce was that?''
 (<font color='red'><b>lord</b></font>)</div>asks my lord.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My lord, I wish you a very good afternoon. Come, Sampson, you and I
will go and dine at the Three Castles.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>And I turned on my heel, making
a bow to Lord R------, and from that day to this I have never set my
foot within the halls of my ancestors.

<p/>Shall I ever see the old mother again, I wonder? She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) lives in Richmond,
never having rebuilt her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) house in the country. When Hal was in England,
we sent her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) pictures of both her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) sons, painted by the admirable Sir
Joshua Reynolds. We sate to him (<font color='blue'><b>Reynolds</b></font>), the last year Mr. Johnson was alive, I
remember. And the Doctor, peering about the studio, and seeing the image
of Hal in his (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>) uniform -LRB-the appearance of it caused no little excitement
in those days-RRB-, asked who was this? and was informed that it was the
famous American General--General Warrington, Sir George's brother.

chambers; and begins to blow my candles out, and says, <div class="bookquote">``Time, Sir

 (<font color='red'><b>crew</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Bless me! So indeed it is.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>And I close my book, and go to my rest,
with a blessing on those now around me asleep.
