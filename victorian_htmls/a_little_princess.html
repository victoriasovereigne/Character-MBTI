<p/>A Little Princess

<p/>Sara


<p/>Once on a dark winter's day, when the yellow fog hung so thick and
heavy in the streets of London that the lamps were lighted and the shop
windows blazed with gas as they do at night, an odd-looking little girl
sat in a cab with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) father and was driven rather slowly through the
big thoroughfares.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) sat with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) feet tucked under her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), and leaned against her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) father,
who held her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) arm, as she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) stared out of the window at the passing
people with a queer old-fashioned thoughtfulness in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) big eyes.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was such a little girl that one did not expect to see such a look
on her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) small face. It would have been an old look for a child of
twelve, and Sara Crewe was only seven. The fact was, however, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Crewe</b></font>)
was always dreaming and thinking odd things and could not herself
remember any time when she (<font color='blue'><b>Crewe</b></font>) had not been thinking things about grown-up
people and the world they belonged to. She (<font color='blue'><b>Crewe</b></font>) felt as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Crewe</b></font>) had lived a
long, long time.

<p/>At this moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Crewe</b></font>) was remembering the voyage she (<font color='blue'><b>Crewe</b></font>) had just made from
Bombay with her (<font color='blue'><b>Crewe</b></font>) father, Captain Crewe. She (<font color='blue'><b>Crewe</b></font>) was thinking of the big
ship, of the Lascars passing silently to and fro on it, of the children
playing about on the hot deck, and of some young officers' wives who
used to try to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Crewe</b></font>) talk to them and laugh at the things she (<font color='blue'><b>Crewe</b></font>) said.

<p/>Principally, she (<font color='blue'><b>Crewe</b></font>) was thinking of what a queer thing it was that at one
time one was in India in the blazing sun, and then in the middle of the
ocean, and then driving in a strange vehicle through strange streets
where the day was as dark as the night. She (<font color='blue'><b>Crewe</b></font>) found this so puzzling
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Crewe</b></font>) moved closer to her (<font color='blue'><b>Crewe</b></font>) father.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Papa,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Crewe</b></font>) said in a low, mysterious little voice which was almost a
whisper, <div class="bookquote">``papa.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What is it, darling?''  (<font color='red'><b>Captain</b></font>)</div>Captain Crewe answered, holding her (<font color='blue'><b>Crewe</b></font>) closer and
looking down into her (<font color='blue'><b>Crewe</b></font>) face. <div class="bookquote">``What is Sara thinking of?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is this the place?''  (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>Sara whispered, cuddling still closer to him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Is
it, papa?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, little Sara, it is. We have reached it at last.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And though she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>)
was only seven years old, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) felt sad when he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) said it.

<p/>It seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) many years since he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) had begun to prepare her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) mind for
<div class="bookquote">``the place,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) always called it. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) mother had died when she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) was
born, so she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) had never known or missed her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>). Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) young, handsome, rich,
petting father seemed to be the only relation she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) had in the world.
They had always played together and been fond of each other. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) only
knew he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was rich because she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) had heard people say so when they thought
she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) was not listening, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) had also heard them say that when she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>)
grew up she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) would be rich, too. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) did not know all that being rich
meant. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) had always lived in a beautiful bungalow, and had been used
to seeing many servants who made salaams to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) and called her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``Missee
Sahib,''  (<font color='red'><b>servants</b></font>)</div>and gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) own way in everything. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) had had toys and
pets and an ayah who worshipped her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) had gradually learned that
people who were rich had these things. That, however, was all she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) knew
about it.

<p/>During her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) short life only one thing had troubled her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>), and that thing
was <div class="bookquote">``the place''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) was to be taken to some day. The climate of India
was very bad for children, and as soon as possible they were sent away
from it--generally to England and to school. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) had seen other
children go away, and had heard their fathers and mothers talk about
the letters they received from them. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) had known that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) would be
obliged to go also, and though sometimes her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) father's stories of the
voyage and the new country had attracted her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) had been troubled by
the thought that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) could not stay with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Couldn't you go to that place with me, papa?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) had asked when she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>)
was five years old. <div class="bookquote">``Couldn't you go to school, too? I would help you
with your lessons.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you will not have to stay for a very long time, little Sara,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
had always said. <div class="bookquote">``You will go to a nice house where there will be a
lot of little girls, and you will play together, and I will send you
plenty of books, and you will grow so fast that it will seem scarcely a
year before you are big enough and clever enough to come back and take
care of papa.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) had liked to think of that. To keep the house for her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) father; to
ride with him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), and sit at the head of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) table when he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had dinner
parties; to talk to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) and read his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) books--that would be what she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>)
would like most in the world, and if one must go away to <div class="bookquote">``the place''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>in
England to attain it, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) must make up her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) mind to go. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) did not care
very much for other little girls, but if she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) had plenty of books she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>)
could console herself. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) liked books more than anything else, and
was, in fact, always inventing stories of beautiful things and telling
them to herself. Sometimes she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) had told them to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) father, and he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had
liked them as much as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) did.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, papa,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) said softly, <div class="bookquote">``if we are here I suppose we must be
resigned.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) laughed at her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) old-fashioned speech and kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was really
not at all resigned himself, though he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) knew he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) must keep that a secret.
His (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) quaint little Sara had been a great companion to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) felt
he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) should be a lonely fellow when, on his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) return to India, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) went into
his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) bungalow knowing he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) need not expect to see the small figure in its
white frock come forward to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). So he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) held her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) very closely in
his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) arms as the cab rolled into the big, dull square in which stood the
house which was their destination.

<p/>It was a big, dull, brick house, exactly like all the others in its
row, but that on the front door there shone a brass plate on which was
engraved in black letters:

<p/>MISS MINCHIN,

<p/>Select Seminary for Young Ladies.


<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here we are, Sara,''  (<font color='red'><b>Captain</b></font>)</div>said Captain Crewe, making his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) voice sound as
cheerful as possible. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) lifted her (<font color='blue'><b>Crewe</b></font>) out of the cab and they
mounted the steps and rang the bell. Sara often thought afterward that
the house was somehow exactly like Miss Minchin. It was respectable
and well furnished, but everything in it was ugly; and the very
armchairs seemed to have hard bones in them. In the hall everything
was hard and polished--even the red cheeks of the moon face on the tall
clock in the corner had a severe varnished look. The drawing room into
which they were ushered was covered by a carpet with a square pattern
upon it, the chairs were square, and a heavy marble timepiece stood
upon the heavy marble mantel.

<p/>As she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) sat down in one of the stiff mahogany chairs, Sara cast one of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) quick looks about her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't like it, papa,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``But then I dare say soldiers--even
brave ones--don't really LIKE going into battle.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Captain</b></font>)</div><p/>Captain Crewe laughed outright at this. He (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) was young and full of fun,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) never tired of hearing Sara's queer speeches.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, little Sara,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``What shall I do when I have no one to say
solemn things to me? No one else is as solemn as you are.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But why do solemn things make you laugh so?''  (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>inquired Sara.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Because you are such fun when you say them,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) answered, laughing
still more. And then suddenly he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) swept her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) into his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) arms and kissed
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) very hard, stopping laughing all at once and looking almost as if
tears had come into his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) eyes.

<p/>It was just then that Miss Minchin entered the room. She (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) was very like
her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) house, Sara felt: tall and dull, and respectable and ugly. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) had
large, cold, fishy eyes, and a large, cold, fishy smile. It spread
itself into a very large smile when she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) saw Sara and Captain Crewe.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) had heard a great many desirable things of the young soldier from
the lady who had recommended her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) school to him (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>). Among other things, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
had heard that he (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) was a rich father who was willing to spend a great
deal of money on his (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) little daughter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It will be a great privilege to have charge of such a beautiful and
promising child, Captain Crewe,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) said, taking Sara's hand and
stroking it. <div class="bookquote">``Lady Meredith has told me of her (<font color='blue'><b>Meredith</b></font>) unusual cleverness. A
clever child is a great treasure in an establishment like mine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div><p/>Sara stood quietly, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) eyes fixed upon Miss Minchin's face. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>)
was thinking something odd, as usual.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why does she (<font color='blue'><b>Meredith</b></font>) say I am a beautiful child?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) was thinking. <div class="bookquote">``I am not
beautiful at all. Colonel Grange's little girl, Isobel, is beautiful.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Isobel</b></font>) has dimples and rose-colored cheeks, and long hair the color of
gold. I have short black hair and green eyes; besides which, I am a
thin child and not fair in the least. I am one of the ugliest children
I ever saw. She (<font color='blue'><b>Isobel</b></font>) is beginning by telling a story.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) was mistaken, however, in thinking she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) was an ugly child. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) was
not in the least like Isobel Grange, who had been the beauty of the
regiment, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Isobel</b></font>) had an odd charm of her (<font color='blue'><b>Isobel</b></font>) own. She (<font color='blue'><b>Isobel</b></font>) was a slim, supple
creature, rather tall for her (<font color='blue'><b>Isobel</b></font>) age, and had an intense, attractive
little face. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Isobel</b></font>) hair was heavy and quite black and only curled at the
tips; her (<font color='blue'><b>Isobel</b></font>) eyes were greenish gray, it is true, but they were big,
wonderful eyes with long, black lashes, and though she (<font color='blue'><b>Isobel</b></font>) herself did not
like the color of them, many other people did. Still she (<font color='blue'><b>Isobel</b></font>) was very firm
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Isobel</b></font>) belief that she (<font color='blue'><b>Isobel</b></font>) was an ugly little girl, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Isobel</b></font>) was not at all
elated by Miss Minchin's flattery.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I should be telling a story if I said she (<font color='blue'><b>Isobel</b></font>) was beautiful,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) thought;
<div class="bookquote">``and I should know I was telling a story. I believe I am as ugly as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Isobel</b></font>) is--in my way. What did she (<font color='blue'><b>Isobel</b></font>) say that for?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>After she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) had known Miss Minchin longer she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) learned why she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) had said
it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) discovered that she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) said the same thing to each papa and mamma
who brought a child to her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) school.

<p/>Sara stood near her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) father and listened while he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) and Miss Minchin
talked. She (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) had been brought to the seminary because Lady Meredith's
two little girls had been educated there, and Captain Crewe had a great
respect for Lady Meredith's experience. Sara was to be what was known
as <div class="bookquote">``a parlor boarder,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) was to enjoy even greater privileges
than parlor boarders usually did. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) was to have a pretty bedroom and
sitting room of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) own; she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) was to have a pony and a carriage, and a
maid to take the place of the ayah who had been her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) nurse in India.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not in the least anxious about her (<font color='blue'><b>Isobel</b></font>) education,''  (<font color='red'><b>Captain</b></font>)</div>Captain Crewe
said, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) gay laugh, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) held Sara's hand and patted it. <div class="bookquote">``The
difficulty will be to keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Isobel</b></font>) from learning too fast and too much.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Isobel</b></font>) is always sitting with her (<font color='blue'><b>Isobel</b></font>) little nose burrowing into books. She (<font color='blue'><b>Isobel</b></font>)
doesn't read them, Miss Minchin; she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) gobbles them up as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) were a
little wolf instead of a little girl. She (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) is always starving for new
books to gobble, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) wants grown-up books--great, big, fat
ones--French and German as well as English--history and biography and
poets, and all sorts of things. Drag her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) away from her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) books when she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>)
reads too much. Make her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) ride her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) pony in the Row or go out and buy a
new doll. She (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) ought to play more with dolls.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Papa,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>said Sara, <div class="bookquote">``you see, if I went out and bought a new doll every
few days I should have more than I could be fond of. Dolls ought to be
intimate friends. Emily is going to be my intimate friend.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div><p/>Captain Crewe looked at Miss Minchin and Miss Minchin looked at Captain
Crewe.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who is Emily?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) inquired.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>), Sara,''  (<font color='red'><b>Captain</b></font>)</div>Captain Crewe said, smiling.

<p/>Sara's green-gray eyes looked very solemn and quite soft as she (<font color='blue'><b>Crewe</b></font>)
answered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) is a doll I haven't got yet,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Crewe</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) is a doll papa is
going to buy for me. We are going out together to find her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>). I have
called her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) Emily. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) is going to be my friend when papa is gone. I
want her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) to talk to about him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Minchin/MISS MINCHIN</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Minchin's large, fishy smile became very flattering indeed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What an original child!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``What a darling little creature!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Captain</b></font>)</div>said Captain Crewe, drawing Sara close. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) is a darling
little creature. Take great care of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) for me, Miss Minchin.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div><p/>Sara stayed with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) father at his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) hotel for several days; in fact, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>)
remained with him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) until he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) sailed away again to India. They went out
and visited many big shops together, and bought a great many things.
They bought, indeed, a great many more things than Sara needed; but
Captain Crewe was a rash, innocent young man and wanted his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) little girl
to have everything she (<font color='blue'><b>Crewe</b></font>) admired and everything he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) admired himself, so
between them they collected a wardrobe much too grand for a child of
seven. There were velvet dresses trimmed with costly furs, and lace
dresses, and embroidered ones, and hats with great, soft ostrich
feathers, and ermine coats and muffs, and boxes of tiny gloves and
handkerchiefs and silk stockings in such abundant supplies that the
polite young women behind the counters whispered to each other that the
odd little girl with the big, solemn eyes must be at least some foreign
princess--perhaps the little daughter of an Indian rajah.

<p/>And at last they found Emily, but they went to a number of toy shops
and looked at a great many dolls before they discovered her (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I want her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) to look as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) wasn't a doll really,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>Sara said. <div class="bookquote">``I
want her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) to look as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) LISTENS when I talk to her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>). The trouble with
dolls, papa'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) put her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) head on one side and reflected as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>)
said it--<div class="bookquote">``the trouble with dolls is that they never seem to HEAR.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>So
they looked at big ones and little ones--at dolls with black eyes and
dolls with blue--at dolls with brown curls and dolls with golden
braids, dolls dressed and dolls undressed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You see,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>Sara said when they were examining one who had no clothes.
<div class="bookquote">``If, when I find her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) has no frocks, we can take her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) to a
dressmaker and have her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) things made to fit. They will fit better if
they are tried on.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>After a number of disappointments they decided to walk and look in at
the shop windows and let the cab follow them. They had passed two or
three places without even going in, when, as they were approaching a
shop which was really not a very large one, Sara suddenly started and
clutched her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) father's arm.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, papa!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) cried. <div class="bookquote">``There is Emily!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>A flush had risen to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) face and there was an expression in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>)
green-gray eyes as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) had just recognized someone she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) was intimate
with and fond of.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>) is actually waiting there for us!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Let us go in to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Captain</b></font>)</div>said Captain Crewe, <div class="bookquote">``I feel as if we ought to have someone
to introduce us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You must introduce me and I will introduce you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>said Sara. <div class="bookquote">``But I
knew her (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>) the minute I saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>)--so perhaps she (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>) knew me, too.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Perhaps she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) had known her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) had certainly a very intelligent
expression in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) eyes when Sara took her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) arms. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) was a large
doll, but not too large to carry about easily; she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) had naturally
curling golden-brown hair, which hung like a mantle about her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>), and her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>)
eyes were a deep, clear, gray-blue, with soft, thick eyelashes which
were real eyelashes and not mere painted lines.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>said Sara, looking into her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) face as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) held her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) on her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>)
knee, <div class="bookquote">``of course papa, this is Emily.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>So Emily was bought and actually taken to a children's outfitter's shop
and measured for a wardrobe as grand as Sara's own. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) had lace
frocks, too, and velvet and muslin ones, and hats and coats and
beautiful lace-trimmed underclothes, and gloves and handkerchiefs and
furs.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I should like her (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>) always to look as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>) was a child with a good
mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>said Sara. <div class="bookquote">``I'm her (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>) mother, though I am going to make a
companion of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Captain</b></font>)</div><p/>Captain Crewe would really have enjoyed the shopping tremendously, but
that a sad thought kept tugging at his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) heart. This all meant that he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>)
was going to be separated from his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) beloved, quaint little comrade.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) got out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) bed in the middle of that night and went and stood
looking down at Sara, who lay asleep with Emily in her (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>) arms. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>) black
hair was spread out on the pillow and Emily's golden-brown hair mingled
with it, both of them had lace-ruffled nightgowns, and both had long
eyelashes which lay and curled up on their cheeks. Emily looked so like
a real child that Captain Crewe felt glad she (<font color='blue'><b>Crewe</b></font>) was there. He (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) drew a big
sigh and pulled his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) mustache with a boyish expression.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Heigh-ho, little Sara!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) said to himself <div class="bookquote">``I don't believe you know
how much your daddy will miss you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The next day he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) took her (<font color='blue'><b>Crewe</b></font>) to Miss Minchin's and left her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) there. He (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) was
to sail away the next morning. He (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) explained to Miss Minchin that his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>)
solicitors, Messrs. Barrow & Skipworth, had charge of his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) affairs in
England and would give her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) any advice she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) wanted, and that they would
pay the bills she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) sent in for Sara's expenses. He (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) would write to Sara
twice a week, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) was to be given every pleasure she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) asked for.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) is a sensible little thing, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) never wants anything it isn't
safe to give her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) said.

<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) went with Sara into her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) little sitting room and they bade each
other good-by. Sara sat on his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) knee and held the lapels of his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) coat in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) small hands, and looked long and hard at his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you learning me by heart, little Sara?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) said, stroking her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) hair.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) answered. <div class="bookquote">``I know you by heart. You are inside my heart.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>And they put their arms round each other and kissed as if they would
never let each other go.

<p/>When the cab drove away from the door, Sara was sitting on the floor of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) sitting room, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) hands under her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) chin and her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) eyes following
it until it had turned the corner of the square. Emily was sitting by
her (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>) looked after it, too. When Miss Minchin sent her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) sister,
Miss Amelia, to see what the child was doing, she (<font color='blue'><b>Amelia</b></font>) found she (<font color='blue'><b>Amelia</b></font>) could not
open the door.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have locked it,''  (<font color='red'><b>a queer voice</b></font>)</div>said a queer, polite little voice from inside. <div class="bookquote">``I
want to be quite by myself, if you please.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Amelia/Amelia</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Amelia was fat and dumpy, and stood very much in awe of her (<font color='blue'><b>Amelia</b></font>)
sister. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amelia</b></font>) was really the better-natured person of the two, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Amelia</b></font>)
never disobeyed Miss Minchin. She (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) went downstairs again, looking
almost alarmed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I never saw such a funny, old-fashioned child, sister,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)
has locked herself in, and she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) is not making the least particle of
noise.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is much better than if she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) kicked and screamed, as some of them
do,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Minchin/MISS MINCHIN</b></font>)</div>Miss Minchin answered. <div class="bookquote">``I expected that a child as much spoiled
as she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) is would set the whole house in an uproar. If ever a child was
given her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) own way in everything, she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) is.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I've been opening her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) trunks and putting her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) things away,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Amelia/Amelia</b></font>)</div>said Miss
Amelia. <div class="bookquote">``I never saw anything like them--sable and ermine on her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)
coats, and real Valenciennes lace on her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) underclothing. You have seen
some of her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) clothes. What DO you think of them?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think they are perfectly ridiculous,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Minchin/MISS MINCHIN</b></font>)</div>replied Miss Minchin, sharply;
<div class="bookquote">``but they will look very well at the head of the line when we take the
schoolchildren to church on Sunday. She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) has been provided for as if she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)
were a little princess.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Minchin/MISS MINCHIN</b></font>)</div><p/>And upstairs in the locked room Sara and Emily sat on the floor and
stared at the corner round which the cab had disappeared, while Captain
Crewe looked backward, waving and kissing his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) hand as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) could not
bear to stop.

<p/>A French Lesson


<p/>When Sara entered the schoolroom the next morning everybody looked at
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) with wide, interested eyes. By that time every pupil--from Lavinia
Herbert, who was nearly thirteen and felt quite grown up, to Lottie
Legh, who was only just four and the baby of the school--had heard a
great deal about her (<font color='blue'><b>Legh</b></font>). They knew very certainly that she (<font color='blue'><b>Legh</b></font>) was Miss
Minchin's show pupil and was considered a credit to the establishment.
One or two of them had even caught a glimpse of her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) French maid,
Mariette, who had arrived the evening before. Lavinia had managed to
pass Sara's room when the door was open, and had seen Mariette opening
a box which had arrived late from some shop.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It was full of petticoats with lace frills on them--frills and
frills,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Lavinia</b></font>) whispered to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lavinia</b></font>) friend Jessie as she (<font color='blue'><b>Lavinia</b></font>) bent over her (<font color='blue'><b>Lavinia</b></font>)
geography. <div class="bookquote">``I saw her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) shaking them out. I heard Miss Minchin say to
Miss Amelia that her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) clothes were so grand that they were ridiculous
for a child. My mamma says that children should be dressed simply. She (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>)
has got one of those petticoats on now. I saw it when she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) sat down.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) has silk stockings on!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jessie</b></font>)</div>whispered Jessie, bending over her (<font color='blue'><b>Lavinia</b></font>)
geography also. <div class="bookquote">``And what little feet! I never saw such little feet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lavinia/Lavinia Herbert</b></font>)</div>sniffed Lavinia, spitefully, <div class="bookquote">``that is the way her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) slippers are
made. My mamma says that even big feet can be made to look small if
you have a clever shoemaker. I don't think she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) is pretty at all. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>)
eyes are such a queer color.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lavinia/Lavinia Herbert</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) isn't pretty as other pretty people are,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jessie</b></font>)</div>said Jessie, stealing a
glance across the room; <div class="bookquote">``but she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) makes you want to look at her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) again.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) has tremendously long eyelashes, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) eyes are almost green.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jessie</b></font>)</div><p/>Sara was sitting quietly in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) seat, waiting to be told what to do.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) had been placed near Miss Minchin's desk. She (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) was not abashed at
all by the many pairs of eyes watching her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) was interested and
looked back quietly at the children who looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) wondered
what they were thinking of, and if they liked Miss Minchin, and if they
cared for their lessons, and if any of them had a papa at all like her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>)
own. She (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) had had a long talk with Emily about her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) papa that morning.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>shoemaker</b></font>) is on the sea now, Emily,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) had said. <div class="bookquote">``We must be very great
friends to each other and tell each other things. Emily, look at me.
You have the nicest eyes I ever saw--but I wish you could speak.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) was a child full of imaginings and whimsical thoughts, and one of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) fancies was that there would be a great deal of comfort in even
pretending that Emily was alive and really heard and understood. After
Mariette had dressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>) dark-blue schoolroom frock and tied her (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>)
hair with a dark-blue ribbon, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>) went to Emily, who sat in a chair of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>) own, and gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>) a book.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You can read that while I am downstairs,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>) said; and, seeing
Mariette looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>) curiously, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>) spoke to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>) with a serious
little face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What I believe about dolls,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``is that they can do things
they will not let us know about. Perhaps, really, Emily can read and
talk and walk, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>) will only do it when people are out of the room.
That is her (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>) secret. You see, if people knew that dolls could do
things, they would make them work. So, perhaps, they have promised
each other to keep it a secret. If you stay in the room, Emily will
just sit there and stare; but if you go out, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>) will begin to read,
perhaps, or go and look out of the window. Then if she (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>) heard either of
us coming, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>) would just run back and jump into her (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>) chair and pretend
she (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>) had been there all the time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Comme elle est drole!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mariette</b></font>)</div>Mariette said to herself, and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>) went
downstairs she (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>) told the head housemaid about it. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>) had already
begun to like this odd little girl who had such an intelligent small
face and such perfect manners. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>) had taken care of children before
who were not so polite. Sara was a very fine little person, and had a
gentle, appreciative way of saying, <div class="bookquote">``If you please, Mariette,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sara a person way</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Thank
you, Mariette,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sara a person way</b></font>)</div>which was very charming. Mariette told the head
housemaid that she (<font color='blue'><b>housemaid</b></font>) thanked her (<font color='blue'><b>housemaid</b></font>) as if she (<font color='blue'><b>housemaid</b></font>) was thanking a lady.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Elle a l'air d'une princesse, cette petite,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>housemaid</b></font>) said. Indeed, she (<font color='blue'><b>housemaid</b></font>) was
very much pleased with her (<font color='blue'><b>housemaid</b></font>) new little mistress and liked her (<font color='blue'><b>housemaid</b></font>) place
greatly.

<p/>After Sara had sat in her (<font color='blue'><b>housemaid</b></font>) seat in the schoolroom for a few minutes,
being looked at by the pupils, Miss Minchin rapped in a dignified
manner upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) desk.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Young ladies,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I wish to introduce you to your new
companion.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>All the little girls rose in their places, and Sara rose
also. <div class="bookquote">``I shall expect you all to be very agreeable to Miss Crewe; she (<font color='blue'><b>Crewe</b></font>)
has just come to us from a great distance--in fact, from India. As soon
as lessons are over you must make each other's acquaintance.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The pupils</b></font>)</div><p/>The pupils bowed ceremoniously, and Sara made a little curtsy, and then
they sat down and looked at each other again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sara,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Minchin/MISS MINCHIN</b></font>)</div>said Miss Minchin in her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) schoolroom manner, <div class="bookquote">``come here to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Minchin/MISS MINCHIN</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) had taken a book from the desk and was turning over its leaves.
Sara went to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) politely.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``As your papa has engaged a French maid for you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) began, <div class="bookquote">``I
conclude that he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) wishes you to make a special study of the French
language.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Sara felt a little awkward.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) engaged her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``because he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>)--he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) thought I would
like her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>), Miss Minchin.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am afraid,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Minchin/MISS MINCHIN</b></font>)</div>said Miss Minchin, with a slightly sour smile, <div class="bookquote">``that you
have been a very spoiled little girl and always imagine that things are
done because you like them. My impression is that your papa wished you
to learn French.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Minchin/MISS MINCHIN</b></font>)</div><p/>If Sara had been older or less punctilious about being quite polite to
people, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) could have explained herself in a very few words. But, as
it was, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) felt a flush rising on her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) cheeks. Miss Minchin was a very
severe and imposing person, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) seemed so absolutely sure that Sara
knew nothing whatever of French that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) felt as if it would be almost
rude to correct her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>). The truth was that Sara could not remember the
time when she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) had not seemed to know French. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) father had often
spoken it to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) when she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) had been a baby. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) mother had been a French
woman, and Captain Crewe had loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Crewe</b></font>) language, so it happened that
Sara had always heard and been familiar with it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I--I have never really learned French, but--but--''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) began, trying
shyly to make herself clear.

<p/>One of Miss Minchin's chief secret annoyances was that she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) did not
speak French herself, and was desirous of concealing the irritating
fact. She (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>), therefore, had no intention of discussing the matter and
laying herself open to innocent questioning by a new little pupil.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That is enough,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) said with polite tartness. <div class="bookquote">``If you have not
learned, you must begin at once. The French master, Monsieur Dufarge,
will be here in a few minutes. Take this book and look at it until he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>)
arrives.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div><p/>Sara's cheeks felt warm. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) went back to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) seat and opened the
book. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) looked at the first page with a grave face. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) knew it
would be rude to smile, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) was very determined not to be rude. But
it was very odd to find herself expected to study a page which told her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>)
that <div class="bookquote">``le pere''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>meant <div class="bookquote">``the father,''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>and <div class="bookquote">``la mere''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>meant <div class="bookquote">``the mother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Minchin glanced toward her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) scrutinizingly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You look rather cross, Sara,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I am sorry you do not like
the idea of learning French.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am very fond of it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>answered Sara, thinking she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) would try again;
<div class="bookquote">``but--''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You must not say `but' when you are told to do things,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said Miss
Minchin. <div class="bookquote">``Look at your book again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div><p/>And Sara did so, and did not smile, even when she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) found that <div class="bookquote">``le fils''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>meant <div class="bookquote">``the son,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and <div class="bookquote">``le frere''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>meant <div class="bookquote">``the brother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``When Monsieur Dufarge comes,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) thought, <div class="bookquote">``I can make him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) understand.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Monsieur Dufarge arrived very shortly afterward. He (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) was a very nice,
intelligent, middle-aged Frenchman, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) looked interested when his (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>)
eyes fell upon Sara trying politely to seem absorbed in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) little book
of phrases.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is this a new pupil for me, madame?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) said to Miss Minchin. <div class="bookquote">``I hope
that is my good fortune.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) papa--Captain Crewe--is very anxious that she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) should begin the
language. But I am afraid she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) has a childish prejudice against it. She (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>)
does not seem to wish to learn,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Minchin/MISS MINCHIN</b></font>)</div>said Miss Minchin.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sorry of that, mademoiselle,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) said kindly to Sara. <div class="bookquote">``Perhaps,
when we begin to study together, I may show you that it is a charming
tongue.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div><p/>Little Sara rose in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) seat. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) was beginning to feel rather
desperate, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) were almost in disgrace. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) looked up into
Monsieur Dufarge's face with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) big, green-gray eyes, and they were
quite innocently appealing. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) would understand as soon
as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) spoke. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) began to explain quite simply in pretty and fluent
French. Madame had not understood. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) had not learned French
exactly--not out of books--but her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) papa and other people had always
spoken it to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) had read it and written it as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) had read
and written English. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) papa loved it, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) loved it because he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>)
did. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) dear mamma, who had died when she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) was born, had been French.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) would be glad to learn anything monsieur would teach her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>), but what
she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) had tried to explain to madame was that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) already knew the words
in this book--and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) held out the little book of phrases.

<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) began to speak Miss Minchin started quite violently and sat
staring at her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) over her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) eyeglasses, almost indignantly, until she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) had
finished. Monsieur Dufarge began to smile, and his (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) smile was one of
great pleasure. To hear this pretty childish voice speaking his (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) own
language so simply and charmingly made him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) feel almost as if he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) were in
his (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) native land--which in dark, foggy days in London sometimes seemed
worlds away. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) had finished, he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) took the phrase book from her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>),
with a look almost affectionate. But he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) spoke to Miss Minchin.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, madame,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``there is not much I can teach her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) has not
LEARNED French; she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) is French. Her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) accent is exquisite.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You ought to have told me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Minchin/MISS MINCHIN</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Miss Minchin, much mortified,
turning to Sara.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I--I tried,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>said Sara. <div class="bookquote">``I--I suppose I did not begin right.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Minchin/MISS MINCHIN</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Minchin knew she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) had tried, and that it had not been her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) fault
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) was not allowed to explain. And when she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) saw that the pupils
had been listening and that Lavinia and Jessie were giggling behind
their French grammars, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lavinia</b></font>) felt infuriated.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Silence, young ladies!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Lavinia</b></font>) said severely, rapping upon the desk.
<div class="bookquote">``Silence at once!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Lavinia</b></font>) began from that minute to feel rather a grudge against her (<font color='blue'><b>Lavinia</b></font>) show
pupil.



<p/>3

<p/>Ermengarde


<p/>On that first morning, when Sara sat at Miss Minchin's side, aware that
the whole schoolroom was devoting itself to observing her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) had
noticed very soon one little girl, about her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) own age, who looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>)
very hard with a pair of light, rather dull, blue eyes. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) was a fat
child who did not look as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) were in the least clever, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) had
a good-naturedly pouting mouth. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) flaxen hair was braided in a tight
pigtail, tied with a ribbon, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) had pulled this pigtail around her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>)
neck, and was biting the end of the ribbon, resting her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) elbows on the
desk, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) stared wonderingly at the new pupil. When Monsieur
Dufarge began to speak to Sara, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) looked a little frightened; and
when Sara stepped forward and, looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>pupil</b></font>) with the innocent,
appealing eyes, answered him (<font color='blue'><b>pupil</b></font>), without any warning, in French, the fat
little girl gave a startled jump, and grew quite red in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) awed
amazement. Having wept hopeless tears for weeks in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) efforts to
remember that <div class="bookquote">``la mere''  (<font color='red'><b>a child age</b></font>)</div>meant <div class="bookquote">``the mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>a child age</b></font>)</div>and <div class="bookquote">``le pere,''  (<font color='red'><b>a child age</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``the
father,'' (<font color='red'><b>a child age</b></font>)</div>--when one spoke sensible English--it was almost too much for
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) suddenly to find herself listening to a child her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) own age who
seemed not only quite familiar with these words, but apparently knew
any number of others, and could mix them up with verbs as if they were
mere trifles.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) stared so hard and bit the ribbon on her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) pigtail so fast that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
attracted the attention of Miss Minchin, who, feeling extremely cross
at the moment, immediately pounced upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss St. John!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) exclaimed severely. <div class="bookquote">``What do you mean by such
conduct? Remove your elbows! Take your ribbon out of your mouth! Sit
up at once!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ermengarde/John/Ermengarde St. John</b></font>)</div><p/>Upon which Miss St. John gave another jump, and when Lavinia and Jessie
tittered she (<font color='blue'><b>Lavinia</b></font>) became redder than ever--so red, indeed, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lavinia</b></font>) almost
looked as if tears were coming into her (<font color='blue'><b>Lavinia</b></font>) poor, dull, childish eyes; and
Sara saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) and was so sorry for her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) began rather to like her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>)
and want to be her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) friend. It was a way of hers always to want to
spring into any fray in which someone was made uncomfortable or unhappy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If Sara had been a boy and lived a few centuries ago,''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) father used
to say, <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) would have gone about the country with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) sword drawn,
rescuing and defending everyone in distress. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) always wants to fight
when she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) sees people in trouble.''

 (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div><p/>So she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) took rather a fancy to fat, slow, little Miss St. John, and kept
glancing toward her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) through the morning. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) saw that lessons were no
easy matter to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>), and that there was no danger of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) ever being
spoiled by being treated as a show pupil. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) French lesson was a
pathetic thing. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) pronunciation made even Monsieur Dufarge smile in
spite of himself, and Lavinia and Jessie and the more fortunate girls
either giggled or looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Lavinia</b></font>) in wondering disdain. But Sara did not
laugh. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) tried to look as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) did not hear when Miss St. John
called <div class="bookquote">``le bon pain,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss St. John</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``lee bong pang.''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss St. John</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) had a fine, hot little
temper of her (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) own, and it made her (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) feel rather savage when she (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) heard
the titters and saw the poor, stupid, distressed child's face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It isn't funny, really,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) said between her (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) teeth, as she (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) bent over
her (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) book. <div class="bookquote">``They ought not to laugh.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the pupils</b></font>)</div><p/>When lessons were over and the pupils gathered together in groups to
talk, Sara looked for Miss St. John, and finding her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) bundled rather
disconsolately in a window-seat, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) walked over to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) and spoke. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>)
only said the kind of thing little girls always say to each other by
way of beginning an acquaintance, but there was something friendly
about Sara, and people always felt it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is your name?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) said.

<p/>To explain Miss St. John's amazement one must recall that a new pupil
is, for a short time, a somewhat uncertain thing; and of this new pupil
the entire school had talked the night before until it fell asleep
quite exhausted by excitement and contradictory stories. A new pupil
with a carriage and a pony and a maid, and a voyage from India to
discuss, was not an ordinary acquaintance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My name's Ermengarde St. John,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) answered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mine is Sara Crewe,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>said Sara. <div class="bookquote">``Yours is very pretty. It sounds
like a story book.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you like it?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>fluttered Ermengarde. <div class="bookquote">``I--I like yours.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ermengarde/John/Ermengarde St. John</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss St. John's chief trouble in life was that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) had a clever father.
Sometimes this seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) a dreadful calamity. If you have a father
who knows everything, who speaks seven or eight languages, and has
thousands of volumes which he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) has apparently learned by heart, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
frequently expects you to be familiar with the contents of your lesson
books at least; and it is not improbable that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) will feel you ought to
be able to remember a few incidents of history and to write a French
exercise. Ermengarde was a severe trial to Mr. St. John. He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) could not
understand how a child of his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) could be a notably and unmistakably dull
creature who never shone in anything.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good heavens!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) had said more than once, as he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) stared at her (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``there
are times when I think she (<font color='blue'><b>Crewe</b></font>) is as stupid as her (<font color='blue'><b>Crewe</b></font>) Aunt Eliza!''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>If her (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) Aunt Eliza had been slow to learn and quick to forget a thing
entirely when she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) had learned it, Ermengarde was strikingly like her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>).
She (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) was the monumental dunce of the school, and it could not be denied.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Crewe</b></font>) must be MADE to learn,''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) father said to Miss Minchin.

<p/>Consequently Ermengarde spent the greater part of her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) life in disgrace
or in tears. She (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) learned things and forgot them; or, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) remembered
them, she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) did not understand them. So it was natural that, having made
Sara's acquaintance, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) should sit and stare at her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) with profound
admiration.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You can speak French, can't you?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) said respectfully.

<p/>Sara got on to the window-seat, which was a big, deep one, and, tucking
up her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) feet, sat with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) hands clasped round her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) knees.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can speak it because I have heard it all my life,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) answered.
<div class="bookquote">``You could speak it if you had always heard it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, no, I couldn't,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ermengarde/John/Ermengarde St. John</b></font>)</div>said Ermengarde. <div class="bookquote">``I NEVER could speak it!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why?''  (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>inquired Sara, curiously.

<p/>Ermengarde shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) head so that the pigtail wobbled.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You heard me just now,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I'm always like that. I can't SAY
the words. They're so queer.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) paused a moment, and then added with a touch of awe in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) voice,
<div class="bookquote">``You are CLEVER, aren't you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>Sara looked out of the window into the dingy square, where the sparrows
were hopping and twittering on the wet, iron railings and the sooty
branches of the trees. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) reflected a few moments. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) had heard it
said very often that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) was <div class="bookquote">``clever,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) wondered if she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) was--and
IF she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) was, how it had happened.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I can't tell.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Then, seeing a mournful
look on the round, chubby face, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) gave a little laugh and changed the
subject.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Would you like to see Emily?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) inquired.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who is Emily?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ermengarde/John/Ermengarde St. John</b></font>)</div>Ermengarde asked, just as Miss Minchin had done.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come up to my room and see,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>said Sara, holding out her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) hand.

<p/>They jumped down from the window-seat together, and went upstairs.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it true,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ermengarde/John/Ermengarde St. John</b></font>)</div>Ermengarde whispered, as they went through the hall--<div class="bookquote">``is
it true that you have a playroom all to yourself?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ermengarde/John/Ermengarde St. John</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>Sara answered. <div class="bookquote">``Papa asked Miss Minchin to let me have one,
because--well, it was because when I play I make up stories and tell
them to myself, and I don't like people to hear me. It spoils it if I
think people listen.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div><p/>They had reached the passage leading to Sara's room by this time, and
Ermengarde stopped short, staring, and quite losing her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) breath.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You MAKE up stories!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) gasped. <div class="bookquote">``Can you do that--as well as speak
French? CAN you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div><p/>Sara looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) in simple surprise.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, anyone can make up things,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Have you never tried?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) put her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) hand warningly on Ermengarde's.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let us go very quietly to the door,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) whispered, <div class="bookquote">``and then I will
open it quite suddenly; perhaps we may catch her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) was half laughing, but there was a touch of mysterious hope in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>)
eyes which fascinated Ermengarde, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) had not the remotest idea
what it meant, or whom it was she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) wanted to <div class="bookquote">``catch,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>or why she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) wanted
to catch her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>). Whatsoever she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) meant, Ermengarde was sure it was
something delightfully exciting. So, quite thrilled with expectation,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) on tiptoe along the passage. They made not the least
noise until they reached the door. Then Sara suddenly turned the
handle, and threw it wide open. Its opening revealed the room quite
neat and quiet, a fire gently burning in the grate, and a wonderful
doll sitting in a chair by it, apparently reading a book.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) got back to her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) seat before we could see her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>Sara
explained. <div class="bookquote">``Of course they always do. They are as quick as lightning.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ermengarde/John/Ermengarde St. John</b></font>)</div><p/>Ermengarde looked from her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) to the doll and back again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Can she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>)--walk?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) asked breathlessly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>answered Sara. <div class="bookquote">``At least I believe she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) can. At least I PRETEND
I believe she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) can. And that makes it seem as if it were true. Have you
never pretended things?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ermengarde/John/Ermengarde St. John</b></font>)</div>said Ermengarde. <div class="bookquote">``Never. I--tell me about it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) was so bewitched by this odd, new companion that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) actually
stared at Sara instead of at Emily--notwithstanding that Emily was the
most attractive doll person she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) had ever seen.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let us sit down,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>said Sara, <div class="bookquote">``and I will tell you. It's so easy that
when you begin you can't stop. You just go on and on doing it always.
And it's beautiful. Emily, you must listen. This is Ermengarde St.
John, Emily. Ermengarde, this is Emily. Would you like to hold her (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, may I?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ermengarde/John/Ermengarde St. John</b></font>)</div>said Ermengarde. <div class="bookquote">``May I, really? She (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>) is beautiful!''  (<font color='red'><b>Emily</b></font>)</div>And
Emily was put into her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) arms.

<p/>Never in her (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>) dull, short life had Miss St. John dreamed of such an hour
as the one she (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>) spent with the queer new pupil before they heard the
lunch-bell ring and were obliged to go downstairs.

<p/>Sara sat upon the hearth-rug and told her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) strange things. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) sat
rather huddled up, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) green eyes shone and her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) cheeks flushed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>)
told stories of the voyage, and stories of India; but what fascinated
Ermengarde the most was her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) fancy about the dolls who walked and
talked, and who could do anything they chose when the human beings were
out of the room, but who must keep their powers a secret and so flew
back to their places <div class="bookquote">``like lightning''  (<font color='red'><b>the beings</b></font>)</div>when people returned to the room.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``WE couldn't do it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>said Sara, seriously. <div class="bookquote">``You see, it's a kind of
magic.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Once, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) was relating the story of the search for Emily,
Ermengarde saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>) face suddenly change. A cloud seemed to pass over
it and put out the light in her (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>) shining eyes. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>) drew her (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>) breath in
so sharply that it made a funny, sad little sound, and then she (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>) shut
her (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>) lips and held them tightly closed, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>) was determined either
to do or NOT to do something. Ermengarde had an idea that if she (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>) had
been like any other little girl, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>) might have suddenly burst out
sobbing and crying. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>) did not.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you a--a pain?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Ermengarde ventured.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>Sara answered, after a moment's silence. <div class="bookquote">``But it is not in my
body.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) added something in a low voice which she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) tried to keep
quite steady, and it was this: <div class="bookquote">``Do you love your father more than
anything else in all the whole world?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Ermengarde's mouth fell open a little. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) knew that it would be far
from behaving like a respectable child at a select seminary to say that
it had never occurred to you that you COULD love your father, that you
would do anything desperate to avoid being left alone in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) society
for ten minutes. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) was, indeed, greatly embarrassed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I--I scarcely ever see him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) stammered. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) is always in the
library--reading things.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I love mine more than all the world ten times over,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>Sara said. <div class="bookquote">``That
is what my pain is. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) has gone away.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) put her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) head quietly down on her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) little, huddled-up knees, and sat
very still for a few minutes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>)'s going to cry out loud,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>thought Ermengarde, fearfully.

<p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) did not. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) short, black locks tumbled about her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) ears, and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) sat still. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) spoke without lifting her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) head.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I promised him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) I would bear it,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``And I will. You have to
bear things. Think what soldiers bear! Papa is a soldier. If there
was a war he (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>) would have to bear marching and thirstiness and, perhaps,
deep wounds. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>) would never say a word--not one word.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ermengarde/John/Ermengarde St. John</b></font>)</div><p/>Ermengarde could only gaze at her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>), but she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) was beginning
to adore her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) was so wonderful and different from anyone else.

<p/>Presently, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) lifted her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) face and shook back her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) black locks, with a
queer little smile.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If I go on talking and talking,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``and telling you things
about pretending, I shall bear it better. You don't forget, but you
bear it better.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Ermengarde did not know why a lump came into her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) throat and her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) eyes
felt as if tears were in them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Lavinia and Jessie are `best friends,'''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) said rather huskily. <div class="bookquote">``I
wish we could be `best friends.''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>Would you have me for yours? You're
clever, and I'm the stupidest child in the school, but I--oh, I do so
like you!''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm glad of that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>said Sara. <div class="bookquote">``It makes you thankful when you are
liked. Yes. We will be friends. And I'll tell you what'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--a sudden
gleam lighting her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) face--<div class="bookquote">``I can help you with your French lessons.''



 (<font color='red'><b>Lottie kind</b></font>)</div><p/>4

<p/>Lottie


<p/>If Sara had been a different kind of child, the life she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) led at Miss
Minchin's Select Seminary for the next few years would not have been at
all good for her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) was treated more as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) were a distinguished
guest at the establishment than as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) were a mere little girl. If
she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) had been a self-opinionated, domineering child, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) might have
become disagreeable enough to be unbearable through being so much
indulged and flattered. If she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) had been an indolent child, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) would
have learned nothing. Privately Miss Minchin disliked her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>), but she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) was
far too worldly a woman to do or say anything which might make such a
desirable pupil wish to leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) school. She (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) knew quite well that if
Sara wrote to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) papa to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) was uncomfortable or unhappy,
Captain Crewe would remove her (<font color='blue'><b>Crewe</b></font>) at once. Miss Minchin's opinion was that
if a child were continually praised and never forbidden to do what she (<font color='blue'><b>Crewe</b></font>)
liked, she (<font color='blue'><b>Crewe</b></font>) would be sure to be fond of the place where she (<font color='blue'><b>Crewe</b></font>) was so
treated. Accordingly, Sara was praised for her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) quickness at her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>)
lessons, for her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) good manners, for her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) amiability to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) fellow pupils,
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) generosity if she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) gave sixpence to a beggar out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) full
little purse; the simplest thing she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) did was treated as if it were a
virtue, and if she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) had not had a disposition and a clever little brain,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) might have been a very self-satisfied young person. But the clever
little brain told her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) a great many sensible and true things about
herself and her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) circumstances, and now and then she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) talked these things
over to Ermengarde as time went on.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Things happen to people by accident,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) used to say. <div class="bookquote">``A lot of nice
accidents have happened to me. It just HAPPENED that I always liked
lessons and books, and could remember things when I learned them. It
just happened that I was born with a father who was beautiful and nice
and clever, and could give me everything I liked. Perhaps I have not
really a good temper at all, but if you have everything you want and
everyone is kind to you, how can you help but be good-tempered? I
don't know'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--looking quite serious--<div class="bookquote">``how I shall ever find out whether
I am really a nice child or a horrid one. Perhaps I'm a HIDEOUS child,
and no one will ever know, just because I never have any trials.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Lavinia has no trials,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ermengarde/John/Ermengarde St. John</b></font>)</div>said Ermengarde, stolidly, <div class="bookquote">``and she (<font color='blue'><b>Lavinia</b></font>) is horrid
enough.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ermengarde/John/Ermengarde St. John</b></font>)</div><p/>Sara rubbed the end of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) little nose reflectively, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) thought the
matter over.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) said at last, <div class="bookquote">``perhaps--perhaps that is because Lavinia is
GROWING.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>This was the result of a charitable recollection of having
heard Miss Amelia say that Lavinia was growing so fast that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lavinia</b></font>)
believed it affected her (<font color='blue'><b>Lavinia</b></font>) health and temper.

<p/>Lavinia, in fact, was spiteful. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lavinia</b></font>) was inordinately jealous of Sara.
Until the new pupil's arrival, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) had felt herself the leader in the
school. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) had led because she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) was capable of making herself
extremely disagreeable if the others did not follow her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) domineered
over the little children, and assumed grand airs with those big enough
to be her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) companions. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) was rather pretty, and had been the
best-dressed pupil in the procession when the Select Seminary walked
out two by two, until Sara's velvet coats and sable muffs appeared,
combined with drooping ostrich feathers, and were led by Miss Minchin
at the head of the line. This, at the beginning, had been bitter
enough; but as time went on it became apparent that Sara was a leader,
too, and not because she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) could make herself disagreeable, but because
she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) never did.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There's one thing about Sara Crewe,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jessie</b></font>)</div>Jessie had enraged her (<font color='blue'><b>Jessie</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``best
friend''  (<font color='red'><b>Jessie</b></font>)</div>by saying honestly, <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>Crewe</b></font>)'s never `grand' about herself the
least bit, and you know she (<font color='blue'><b>Crewe</b></font>) might be, Lavvie. I believe I couldn't
help being--just a little--if I had so many fine things and was made
such a fuss over. It's disgusting, the way Miss Minchin shows her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) off
when parents come.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jessie</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">''`Dear Sara must come into the drawing room and talk to Mrs. Musgrave
about India,'''  (<font color='red'><b>Lavinia/Lavinia Herbert</b></font>)</div>mimicked Lavinia, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lavinia</b></font>) most highly flavored imitation
of Miss Minchin. <div class="bookquote">''`Dear Sara must speak French to Lady Pitkin. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>)
accent is so perfect.''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Minchin/MISS MINCHIN</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) didn't learn her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) French at the Seminary, at
any rate. And there's nothing so clever in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) knowing it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) says
herself she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) didn't learn it at all. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) just picked it up, because she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>)
always heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) papa speak it. And, as to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) papa, there is nothing
so grand in being an Indian officer.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jessie</b></font>)</div>said Jessie, slowly, <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)'s killed tigers. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) killed the one in
the skin Sara has in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) room. That's why she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) likes it so. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) lies on
it and strokes its head, and talks to it as if it was a cat.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jessie</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>)'s always doing something silly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lavinia/Lavinia Herbert</b></font>)</div>snapped Lavinia. <div class="bookquote">``My mamma says
that way of hers of pretending things is silly. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) says she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) will grow
up eccentric.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div><p/>It was quite true that Sara was never <div class="bookquote">``grand.''  (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) was a friendly
little soul, and shared her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) privileges and belongings with a free hand.
The little ones, who were accustomed to being disdained and ordered out
of the way by mature ladies aged ten and twelve, were never made to cry
by this most envied of them all. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) was a motherly young person, and
when people fell down and scraped their knees, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) ran and helped them
up and patted them, or found in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) pocket a bonbon or some other
article of a soothing nature. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) never pushed them out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) way or
alluded to their years as a humiliation and a blot upon their small
characters.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you are four you are four,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) said severely to Lavinia on an
occasion of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lavinia</b></font>) having--it must be confessed--slapped Lottie and called
her (<font color='blue'><b>Lottie</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``a brat;''  (<font color='red'><b>Lottie/Lottie Legh</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``but you will be five next year, and six the year after
that. And,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lottie/Lottie Legh</b></font>)</div>opening large, convicting eyes, <div class="bookquote">``it takes sixteen years to
make you twenty.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lavinia/Lavinia Herbert</b></font>)</div>said Lavinia, <div class="bookquote">``how we can calculate!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lavinia/Lavinia Herbert</b></font>)</div>In fact, it was not
to be denied that sixteen and four made twenty--and twenty was an age
the most daring were scarcely bold enough to dream of.

<p/>So the younger children adored Sara. More than once she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) had been known
to have a tea party, made up of these despised ones, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) own room.
And Emily had been played with, and Emily's own tea service used--the
one with cups which held quite a lot of much-sweetened weak tea and had
blue flowers on them. No one had seen such a very real doll's tea set
before. From that afternoon Sara was regarded as a goddess and a queen
by the entire alphabet class.

<p/>Lottie Legh worshipped her (<font color='blue'><b>Legh</b></font>) to such an extent that if Sara had not been
a motherly person, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) would have found her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) tiresome. Lottie had been
sent to school by a rather flighty young papa who could not imagine
what else to do with her (<font color='blue'><b>Lottie</b></font>). Her (<font color='blue'><b>Lottie</b></font>) young mother had died, and as the child
had been treated like a favorite doll or a very spoiled pet monkey or
lap dog ever since the first hour of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lottie</b></font>) life, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lottie</b></font>) was a very appalling
little creature. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Lottie</b></font>) wanted anything or did not want anything she (<font color='blue'><b>Lottie</b></font>)
wept and howled; and, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Lottie</b></font>) always wanted the things she (<font color='blue'><b>Lottie</b></font>) could not
have, and did not want the things that were best for her (<font color='blue'><b>Lottie</b></font>), her (<font color='blue'><b>Lottie</b></font>) shrill
little voice was usually to be heard uplifted in wails in one part of
the house or another.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Lottie</b></font>) strongest weapon was that in some mysterious way she (<font color='blue'><b>Lottie</b></font>) had found out
that a very small girl who had lost her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) mother was a person who ought
to be pitied and made much of. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had probably heard some grown-up
people talking her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) over in the early days, after her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) mother's death. So
it became her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) habit to make great use of this knowledge.

<p/>The first time Sara took her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) in charge was one morning when, on passing
a sitting room, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) heard both Miss Minchin and Miss Amelia trying to
suppress the angry wails of some child who, evidently, refused to be
silenced. She (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) refused so strenuously indeed that Miss Minchin was
obliged to almost shout--in a stately and severe manner--to make
herself heard.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What IS she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) crying for?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) almost yelled.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh--oh--oh!''  (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>Sara heard; <div class="bookquote">``I haven't got any mam--ma-a!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Lottie!''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Amelia/Amelia</b></font>)</div>screamed Miss Amelia. <div class="bookquote">``Do stop, darling! Don't cry!
Please don't!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lottie/Lottie Legh</b></font>)</div>Lottie howled tempestuously.
<div class="bookquote">``Haven't--got--any--mam--ma-a!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Lottie</b></font>) ought to be whipped,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Minchin/MISS MINCHIN</b></font>)</div>Miss Minchin proclaimed. <div class="bookquote">``You SHALL be
whipped, you naughty child!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lottie/Lottie Legh</b></font>)</div><p/>Lottie wailed more loudly than ever. Miss Amelia began to cry. Miss
Minchin's voice rose until it almost thundered, then suddenly she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>)
sprang up from her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) chair in impotent indignation and flounced out of
the room, leaving Miss Amelia to arrange the matter.

<p/>Sara had paused in the hall, wondering if she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) ought to go into the
room, because she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) had recently begun a friendly acquaintance with
Lottie and might be able to quiet her (<font color='blue'><b>Lottie</b></font>). When Miss Minchin came out and
saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) looked rather annoyed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) realized that her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) voice, as
heard from inside the room, could not have sounded either dignified or
amiable.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Sara!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) exclaimed, endeavoring to produce a suitable smile.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I stopped,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>explained Sara, <div class="bookquote">``because I knew it was Lottie--and I
thought, perhaps--just perhaps, I could make her (<font color='blue'><b>Lottie</b></font>) be quiet. May I try,
Miss Minchin?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you can, you are a clever child,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Minchin/MISS MINCHIN</b></font>)</div>answered Miss Minchin, drawing in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) mouth sharply. Then, seeing that Sara looked slightly chilled by
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) asperity, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) changed her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) manner. <div class="bookquote">``But you are clever in
everything,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) said in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) approving way. <div class="bookquote">``I dare say you can manage
her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>). Go in.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) left her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>).

<p/>When Sara entered the room, Lottie was lying upon the floor, screaming
and kicking her (<font color='blue'><b>Lottie</b></font>) small fat legs violently, and Miss Amelia was bending
over her (<font color='blue'><b>Amelia</b></font>) in consternation and despair, looking quite red and damp with
heat. Lottie had always found, when in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lottie</b></font>) own nursery at home, that
kicking and screaming would always be quieted by any means she (<font color='blue'><b>Lottie</b></font>) insisted
on. Poor plump Miss Amelia was trying first one method, and then
another.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Poor darling,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Amelia</b></font>) said one moment, <div class="bookquote">``I know you haven't any mamma,
poor--''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Then in quite another tone, <div class="bookquote">``If you don't stop, Lottie, I will
shake you. Poor little angel! There--! You wicked, bad, detestable
child, I will smack you! I will!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Sara went to them quietly. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) did not know at all what she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) was going
to do, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) had a vague inward conviction that it would be better
not to say such different kinds of things quite so helplessly and
excitedly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Amelia,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) said in a low voice, <div class="bookquote">``Miss Minchin says I may try to
make her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) stop--may I?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Amelia turned and looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Amelia</b></font>) hopelessly. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, DO you think you
can?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Amelia</b></font>) gasped.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know whether I CAN'' (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>, answered Sara, still in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) half-whisper;
<div class="bookquote">``but I will try.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Amelia stumbled up from her (<font color='blue'><b>Amelia</b></font>) knees with a heavy sigh, and Lottie's
fat little legs kicked as hard as ever.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you will steal out of the room,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>said Sara, <div class="bookquote">``I will stay with her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Sara!''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Amelia/Amelia</b></font>)</div>almost whimpered Miss Amelia. <div class="bookquote">``We never had such a
dreadful child before. I don't believe we can keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) crept out of the room, and was very much relieved to find an
excuse for doing it.

<p/>Sara stood by the howling furious child for a few moments, and looked
down at her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) without saying anything. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) sat down flat on the
floor beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) and waited. Except for Lottie's angry screams, the
room was quite quiet. This was a new state of affairs for little Miss
Legh, who was accustomed, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Lottie</b></font>) screamed, to hear other people
protest and implore and command and coax by turns. To lie and kick and
shriek, and find the only person near you not seeming to mind in the
least, attracted her (<font color='blue'><b>Lottie</b></font>) attention. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lottie</b></font>) opened her (<font color='blue'><b>Lottie</b></font>) tight-shut streaming
eyes to see who this person was. And it was only another little girl.
But it was the one who owned Emily and all the nice things. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>)
was looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>) steadily and as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>) was merely thinking. Having
paused for a few seconds to find this out, Lottie thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Lottie</b></font>) must
begin again, but the quiet of the room and of Sara's odd, interested
face made her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) first howl rather half-hearted.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I--haven't--any--ma--ma--ma-a!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) announced; but her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) voice was not
so strong.

<p/>Sara looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) still more steadily, but with a sort of
understanding in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Neither have I,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) said.

<p/>This was so unexpected that it was astounding. Lottie actually dropped
her (<font color='blue'><b>Lottie</b></font>) legs, gave a wriggle, and lay and stared. A new idea will stop a
crying child when nothing else will. Also it was true that while
Lottie disliked Miss Minchin, who was cross, and Miss Amelia, who was
foolishly indulgent, she (<font color='blue'><b>Amelia</b></font>) rather liked Sara, little as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) knew her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>).
She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) did not want to give up her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) grievance, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) thoughts were
distracted from it, so she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) wriggled again, and, after a sulky sob,
said, <div class="bookquote">``Where is she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Sara paused a moment. Because she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) had been told that her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) mamma was in
heaven, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) had thought a great deal about the matter, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) thoughts
had not been quite like those of other people.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) went to heaven,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``But I am sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) comes out sometimes
to see me--though I don't see her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>). So does yours. Perhaps they can
both see us now. Perhaps they are both in this room.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lottie/Lottie Legh</b></font>)</div><p/>Lottie sat bolt upright, and looked about her (<font color='blue'><b>Lottie</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Lottie</b></font>) was a pretty,
little, curly-headed creature, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Lottie</b></font>) round eyes were like wet
forget-me-nots. If her (<font color='blue'><b>Lottie</b></font>) mamma had seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Lottie</b></font>) during the last half-hour,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Lottie</b></font>) might not have thought her (<font color='blue'><b>Lottie</b></font>) the kind of child who ought to be
related to an angel.

<p/>Sara went on talking. Perhaps some people might think that what she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>)
said was rather like a fairy story, but it was all so real to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) own
imagination that Lottie began to listen in spite of herself. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lottie</b></font>) had
been told that her (<font color='blue'><b>Lottie</b></font>) mamma had wings and a crown, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Lottie</b></font>) had been shown
pictures of ladies in beautiful white nightgowns, who were said to be
angels. But Sara seemed to be telling a real story about a lovely
country where real people were.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There are fields and fields of flowers,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) said, forgetting herself,
as usual, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) began, and talking rather as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) were in a dream,
<div class="bookquote">``fields and fields of lilies--and when the soft wind blows over them it
wafts the scent of them into the air--and everybody always breathes it,
because the soft wind is always blowing. And little children run about
in the lily fields and gather armfuls of them, and laugh and make
little wreaths. And the streets are shining. And people are never
tired, however far they walk. They can float anywhere they like. And
there are walls made of pearl and gold all round the city, but they are
low enough for the people to go and lean on them, and look down onto
the earth and smile, and send beautiful messages.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Whatsoever story she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) had begun to tell, Lottie would, no doubt, have
stopped crying, and been fascinated into listening; but there was no
denying that this story was prettier than most others. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lottie</b></font>) dragged
herself close to Sara, and drank in every word until the end came--far
too soon. When it did come, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) was so sorry that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) put up her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) lip
ominously.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I want to go there,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) cried. <div class="bookquote">``I--haven't any mamma in this school.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div><p/>Sara saw the danger signal, and came out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) dream. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) took hold
of the chubby hand and pulled her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) close to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) side with a coaxing
little laugh.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I will be your mamma,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``We will play that you are my little
girl. And Emily shall be your sister.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lottie/Lottie Legh</b></font>)</div><p/>Lottie's dimples all began to show themselves.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Shall she (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Lottie</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>answered Sara, jumping to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) feet. <div class="bookquote">``Let us go and tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>).
And then I will wash your face and brush your hair.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lottie/Lottie Legh</b></font>)</div><p/>To which Lottie agreed quite cheerfully, and trotted out of the room
and upstairs with her (<font color='blue'><b>Lottie</b></font>), without seeming even to remember that the whole
of the last hour's tragedy had been caused by the fact that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lottie</b></font>) had
refused to be washed and brushed for lunch and Miss Minchin had been
called in to use her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) majestic authority.

<p/>And from that time Sara was an adopted mother.



<p/>5

<p/>Becky


<p/>Of course the greatest power Sara possessed and the one which gained
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) even more followers than her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) luxuries and the fact that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) was
<div class="bookquote">``the show pupil,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>the power that Lavinia and certain other girls were
most envious of, and at the same time most fascinated by in spite of
themselves, was her (<font color='blue'><b>Lavinia</b></font>) power of telling stories and of making everything
she (<font color='blue'><b>Lavinia</b></font>) talked about seem like a story, whether it was one or not.

<p/>Anyone who has been at school with a teller of stories knows what the
wonder means--how he (<font color='blue'><b>teller</b></font>) or she (<font color='blue'><b>Lavinia</b></font>) is followed about and besought in a whisper
to relate romances; how groups gather round and hang on the outskirts
of the favored party in the hope of being allowed to join in and
listen. Sara not only could tell stories, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) adored telling them.
When she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) sat or stood in the midst of a circle and began to invent
wonderful things, her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) green eyes grew big and shining, her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) cheeks
flushed, and, without knowing that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) was doing it, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) began to act
and made what she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) told lovely or alarming by the raising or dropping of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) voice, the bend and sway of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) slim body, and the dramatic
movement of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) hands. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) forgot that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) was talking to listening
children; she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) saw and lived with the fairy folk, or the kings and
queens and beautiful ladies, whose adventures she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) was narrating.
Sometimes when she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) had finished her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) story, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) was quite out of breath
with excitement, and would lay her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) hand on her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) thin, little,
quick-rising chest, and half laugh as if at herself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``When I am telling it,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) would say, <div class="bookquote">``it doesn't seem as if it was
only made up. It seems more real than you are--more real than the
schoolroom. I feel as if I were all the people in the story--one after
the other. It is queer.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) had been at Miss Minchin's school about two years when, one foggy
winter's afternoon, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) was getting out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) carriage, comfortably
wrapped up in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) warmest velvets and furs and looking very much
grander than she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) knew, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) caught sight, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) crossed the pavement,
of a dingy little figure standing on the area steps, and stretching its
neck so that its wide-open eyes might peer at her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) through the railings.
Something in the eagerness and timidity of the smudgy face made her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>)
look at it, and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) looked she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) smiled because it was her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) way to
smile at people.

<p/>But the owner of the smudgy face and the wide-open eyes evidently was
afraid that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) ought not to have been caught looking at pupils of
importance. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) dodged out of sight like a jack-in-the-box and
scurried back into the kitchen, disappearing so suddenly that if she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>)
had not been such a poor little forlorn thing, Sara would have laughed
in spite of herself. That very evening, as Sara was sitting in the
midst of a group of listeners in a corner of the schoolroom telling one
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) stories, the very same figure timidly entered the room, carrying
a coal box much too heavy for her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>), and knelt down upon the hearth rug
to replenish the fire and sweep up the ashes.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) was cleaner than she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) had been when she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) peeped through the area
railings, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) looked just as frightened. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) was evidently afraid
to look at the children or seem to be listening. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) put on pieces of
coal cautiously with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) fingers so that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) might make no disturbing
noise, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) swept about the fire irons very softly. But Sara saw in
two minutes that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) was deeply interested in what was going on, and
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) was doing her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) work slowly in the hope of catching a word here
and there. And realizing this, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) raised her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) voice and spoke more
clearly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The Mermaids swam softly about in the crystal-green water, and dragged
after them a fishing-net woven of deep-sea pearls,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``The
Princess sat on the white rock and watched them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>a princess</b></font>)</div><p/>It was a wonderful story about a princess who was loved by a Prince
Merman, and went to live with him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) in shining caves under the sea.

<p/>The small drudge before the grate swept the hearth once and then swept
it again. Having done it twice, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) did it three times; and, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>)
was doing it the third time, the sound of the story so lured her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) to
listen that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) fell under the spell and actually forgot that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) had
no right to listen at all, and also forgot everything else. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) sat
down upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) heels as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) knelt on the hearth rug, and the brush hung
idly in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) fingers. The voice of the storyteller went on and drew her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>)
with it into winding grottos under the sea, glowing with soft, clear
blue light, and paved with pure golden sands. Strange sea flowers and
grasses waved about her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>), and far away faint singing and music echoed.

<p/>The hearth brush fell from the work-roughened hand, and Lavinia Herbert
looked round.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That girl has been listening,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) said.

<p/>The culprit snatched up her (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) brush, and scrambled to her (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) feet. She (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>)
caught at the coal box and simply scuttled out of the room like a
frightened rabbit.

<p/>Sara felt rather hot-tempered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I knew she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was listening,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Why shouldn't she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lavinia/Lavinia Herbert</b></font>)</div><p/>Lavinia tossed her (<font color='blue'><b>Lavinia</b></font>) head with great elegance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Lavinia</b></font>) remarked, <div class="bookquote">``I do not know whether your mamma would like you
to tell stories to servant girls, but I know MY mamma wouldn't like ME
to do it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My mamma!''  (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>said Sara, looking odd. <div class="bookquote">``I don't believe she (<font color='blue'><b>MY</b></font>) would mind in
the least. She (<font color='blue'><b>MY</b></font>) knows that stories belong to everybody.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lavinia/Lavinia Herbert</b></font>)</div>retorted Lavinia, in severe recollection, <div class="bookquote">``that your mamma
was dead. How can she (<font color='blue'><b>MY</b></font>) know things?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lavinia/Lavinia Herbert</b></font>)</div><p/>``Do you think she (<font color='blue'><b>MY</b></font>) DOESN<div class="bookquote">``T know things?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Sara, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) stern little
voice. Sometimes she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) had a rather stern little voice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sara's mamma knows everything,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lottie/Lottie Legh</b></font>)</div>piped in Lottie. <div class="bookquote">``So does my
mamma--`cept Sara is my mamma at Miss Minchin's--my other one knows
everything. The streets are shining, and there are fields and fields
of lilies, and everybody gathers them. Sara tells me when she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) puts me
to bed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You wicked thing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lavinia/Lavinia Herbert</b></font>)</div>said Lavinia, turning on Sara; <div class="bookquote">``making fairy
stories about heaven.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There are much more splendid stories in Revelation,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>returned Sara.
<div class="bookquote">``Just look and see! How do you know mine are fairy stories? But I can
tell you'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--with a fine bit of unheavenly temper--<div class="bookquote">``you will never find
out whether they are or not if you're not kinder to people than you are
now. Come along, Lottie.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) marched out of the room, rather
hoping that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) might see the little servant again somewhere, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>)
found no trace of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) when she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) got into the hall.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who is that little girl who makes the fires?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) asked Mariette that
night.

<p/>Mariette broke forth into a flow of description.

<p/>Ah, indeed, Mademoiselle Sara might well ask. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) was a forlorn little
thing who had just taken the place of scullery maid--though, as to
being scullery maid, she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) was everything else besides. She (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) blacked boots
and grates, and carried heavy coal-scuttles up and down stairs, and
scrubbed floors and cleaned windows, and was ordered about by
everybody. She (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) was fourteen years old, but was so stunted in growth
that she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) looked about twelve. In truth, Mariette was sorry for her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>).
She (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) was so timid that if one chanced to speak to her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) it appeared as if
her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) poor, frightened eyes would jump out of her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) head.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) name?''  (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>asked Sara, who had sat by the table, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) chin
on her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) hands, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) listened absorbedly to the recital.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) name was Becky. Mariette heard everyone below-stairs calling,
<div class="bookquote">``Becky, do this,''  (<font color='red'><b>everyone</b></font>)</div>and <div class="bookquote">``Becky, do that,''  (<font color='red'><b>everyone</b></font>)</div>every five minutes in the day.

<p/>Sara sat and looked into the fire, reflecting on Becky for some time
after Mariette left her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) made up a story of which Becky was the
ill-used heroine. She (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) looked as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) had never had quite
enough to eat. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) very eyes were hungry. She (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) hoped she (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) should see
her (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) again, but though she (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) caught sight of her (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) carrying things up or
down stairs on several occasions, she (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) always seemed in such a hurry and
so afraid of being seen that it was impossible to speak to her (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>).

<p/>But a few weeks later, on another foggy afternoon, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) entered her (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>)
sitting room she (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) found herself confronting a rather pathetic picture.
In her (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) own special and pet easy-chair before the bright fire,
Becky--with a coal smudge on her (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) nose and several on her (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) apron, with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) poor little cap hanging half off her (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) head, and an empty coal box on
the floor near her (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>)--sat fast asleep, tired out beyond even the
endurance of her (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) hard-working young body. She (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) had been sent up to put
the bedrooms in order for the evening. There were a great many of them,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) had been running about all day. Sara's rooms she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) had saved
until the last. They were not like the other rooms, which were plain
and bare. Ordinary pupils were expected to be satisfied with mere
necessaries. Sara's comfortable sitting room seemed a bower of luxury
to the scullery maid, though it was, in fact, merely a nice, bright
little room. But there were pictures and books in it, and curious
things from India; there was a sofa and the low, soft chair; Emily sat
in a chair of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>) own, with the air of a presiding goddess, and there
was always a glowing fire and a polished grate. Becky saved it until
the end of her (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) afternoon's work, because it rested her (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) to go into it,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) always hoped to snatch a few minutes to sit down in the soft
chair and look about her (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>), and think about the wonderful good fortune of
the child who owned such surroundings and who went out on the cold days
in beautiful hats and coats one tried to catch a glimpse of through the
area railing.

<p/>On this afternoon, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) had sat down, the sensation of relief to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) short, aching legs had been so wonderful and delightful that it had
seemed to soothe her (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) whole body, and the glow of warmth and comfort
from the fire had crept over her (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) like a spell, until, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) looked at
the red coals, a tired, slow smile stole over her (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) smudged face, her (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>)
head nodded forward without her (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) being aware of it, her (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) eyes drooped,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) fell fast asleep. She (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) had really been only about ten minutes
in the room when Sara entered, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) was in as deep a sleep as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>)
had been, like the Sleeping Beauty, slumbering for a hundred years.
But she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) did not look--poor Becky--like a Sleeping Beauty at all. She (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>)
looked only like an ugly, stunted, worn-out little scullery drudge.

<p/>Sara seemed as much unlike her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) were a creature from another
world.

<p/>On this particular afternoon she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) had been taking her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) dancing lesson,
and the afternoon on which the dancing master appeared was rather a
grand occasion at the seminary, though it occurred every week. The
pupils were attired in their prettiest frocks, and as Sara danced
particularly well, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) was very much brought forward, and Mariette was
requested to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) as diaphanous and fine as possible.

<p/>Today a frock the color of a rose had been put on her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>), and Mariette had
bought some real buds and made her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) a wreath to wear on her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) black locks.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) had been learning a new, delightful dance in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) had been
skimming and flying about the room, like a large rose-colored
butterfly, and the enjoyment and exercise had brought a brilliant,
happy glow into her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) face.

<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) entered the room, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) floated in with a few of the butterfly
steps--and there sat Becky, nodding her (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) cap sideways off her (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) head.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh!''  (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>cried Sara, softly, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``That poor thing!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>It did not occur to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) to feel cross at finding her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) pet chair occupied
by the small, dingy figure. To tell the truth, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) was quite glad to
find it there. When the ill-used heroine of her (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>) story wakened, she (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>)
could talk to her (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>) crept toward her (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>) quietly, and stood looking at
her (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>). Becky gave a little snore.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish she (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>)'d waken herself,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>Sara said. <div class="bookquote">``I don't like to waken her (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>).
But Miss Minchin would be cross if she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) found out. I'll just wait a few
minutes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) took a seat on the edge of the table, and sat swinging her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) slim,
rose-colored legs, and wondering what it would be best to do. Miss
Amelia might come in at any moment, and if she (<font color='blue'><b>Amelia</b></font>) did, Becky would be sure
to be scolded.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) is so tired,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) thought. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) is so tired!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>A piece of flaming coal ended her (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) perplexity for her (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) that very moment.
It broke off from a large lump and fell on to the fender. Becky
started, and opened her (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) eyes with a frightened gasp. She (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) did not know
she (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) had fallen asleep. She (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) had only sat down for one moment and felt
the beautiful glow--and here she (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) found herself staring in wild alarm at
the wonderful pupil, who sat perched quite near her (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>), like a
rose-colored fairy, with interested eyes.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) sprang up and clutched at her (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) cap. She (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) felt it dangling over her (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>)
ear, and tried wildly to put it straight. Oh, she (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) had got herself into
trouble now with a vengeance! To have impudently fallen asleep on such
a young lady's chair! She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) would be turned out of doors without wages.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) made a sound like a big breathless sob.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, miss! Oh, miss!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) stuttered. <div class="bookquote">``I arst yer pardon, miss! Oh, I
do, miss!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div><p/>Sara jumped down, and came quite close to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't be frightened,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) said, quite as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) had been speaking to a
little girl like herself. <div class="bookquote">``It doesn't matter the least bit.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I didn't go to do it, miss,''  (<font color='red'><b>Becky</b></font>)</div>protested Becky. ``It was the warm
fire--an' me bein' so tired. It--it WASN<div class="bookquote">``T impertience!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div><p/>Sara broke into a friendly little laugh, and put her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) hand on her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>)
shoulder.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You were tired,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``you could not help it. You are not really
awake yet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>How poor Becky stared at her (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>)! In fact, she (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) had never heard such a
nice, friendly sound in anyone's voice before. She (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) was used to being
ordered about and scolded, and having her (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) ears boxed. And this one--in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) rose-colored dancing afternoon splendor--was looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) as if
she (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) were not a culprit at all--as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) had a right to be tired--even
to fall asleep! The touch of the soft, slim little paw on her (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) shoulder
was the most amazing thing she (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) had ever known.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ain't--ain't yer angry, miss?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) gasped. <div class="bookquote">``Ain't yer goin' to tell
the missus?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>cried out Sara. <div class="bookquote">``Of course I'm not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>The woeful fright in the coal-smutted face made her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) suddenly so sorry
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) could scarcely bear it. One of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) queer thoughts rushed into
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) mind. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) put her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) hand against Becky's cheek.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``we are just the same--I am only a little girl like
you. It's just an accident that I am not you, and you are not me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Becky did not understand in the least. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) mind could not grasp such
amazing thoughts, and <div class="bookquote">``an accident''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>meant to her (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) a calamity in which
some one was run over or fell off a ladder and was carried to <div class="bookquote">``the
`orspital.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A' accident, miss,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) fluttered respectfully. <div class="bookquote">``Is it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>Sara answered, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) dreamily for a moment. But
the next she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) spoke in a different tone. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) realized that Becky did
not know what she (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) meant.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you done your work?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) asked. <div class="bookquote">``Dare you stay here a few
minutes?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Becky</b></font>)</div><p/>Becky lost her (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) breath again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here, miss? Me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div><p/>Sara ran to the door, opened it, and looked out and listened.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No one is anywhere about,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) explained. <div class="bookquote">``If your bedrooms are
finished, perhaps you might stay a tiny while. I thought--perhaps--you
might like a piece of cake.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Becky</b></font>)</div><p/>The next ten minutes seemed to Becky like a sort of delirium. Sara
opened a cupboard, and gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) a thick slice of cake. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) seemed to
rejoice when it was devoured in hungry bites. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) talked and asked
questions, and laughed until Becky's fears actually began to calm
themselves, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) once or twice gathered boldness enough to ask a
question or so herself, daring as she (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) felt it to be.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is that--''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) ventured, looking longingly at the rose-colored frock.
And she (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) asked it almost in a whisper. <div class="bookquote">``Is that there your best?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is one of my dancing-frocks,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>answered Sara. <div class="bookquote">``I like it, don't
you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Becky</b></font>)</div><p/>For a few seconds Becky was almost speechless with admiration. Then
she (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) said in an awed voice, ``Onct I see a princess. I was standin' in
the street with the crowd outside Covin' Garden, watchin' the swells go
inter the operer. An' there was one everyone stared at most. They ses
to each other, ``That's the princess.<div class="bookquote">'' She (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) was a growed-up young lady,
but she (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) was pink all over--gownd an' cloak, an' flowers an' all. I
called her (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) to mind the minnit I see you, sittin' there on the table,
miss. You looked like her (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>That the princess</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I've often thought,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>said Sara, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) reflecting voice, <div class="bookquote">``that I
should like to be a princess; I wonder what it feels like. I believe I
will begin pretending I am one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div><p/>Becky stared at her (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) admiringly, and, as before, did not understand her (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>)
in the least. She (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) watched her (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) with a sort of adoration. Very soon Sara
left her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) reflections and turned to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) with a new question.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Becky,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``weren't you listening to that story?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, miss,''  (<font color='red'><b>Becky</b></font>)</div>confessed Becky, a little alarmed again. <div class="bookquote">``I knowed I
hadn't orter, but it was that beautiful I--I couldn't help it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I liked you to listen to it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>said Sara. <div class="bookquote">``If you tell stories, you
like nothing so much as to tell them to people who want to listen. I
don't know why it is. Would you like to hear the rest?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Becky</b></font>)</div><p/>Becky lost her (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) breath again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Me hear it?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) cried. <div class="bookquote">``Like as if I was a pupil, miss! All about
the Prince--and the little white Mer-babies swimming about
laughing--with stars in their hair?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div><p/>Sara nodded.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You haven't time to hear it now, I'm afraid,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``but if you
will tell me just what time you come to do my rooms, I will try to be
here and tell you a bit of it every day until it is finished. It's a
lovely long one--and I'm always putting new bits to it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Becky</b></font>)</div>breathed Becky, devoutly, <div class="bookquote">``I wouldn't mind HOW heavy the coal
boxes was--or WHAT the cook done to me, if--if I might have that to
think of.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Becky</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You may,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>said Sara. <div class="bookquote">``I'll tell it ALL to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Becky</b></font>)</div><p/>When Becky went downstairs, she (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) was not the same Becky who had
staggered up, loaded down by the weight of the coal scuttle. She (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) had an
extra piece of cake in her (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) pocket, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) had been fed and warmed, but
not only by cake and fire. Something else had warmed and fed her (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>), and
the something else was Sara.

<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) was gone Sara sat on her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) favorite perch on the end of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>)
table. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) feet were on a chair, her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) elbows on her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) knees, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) chin
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) hands.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If I WAS a princess--a REAL princess,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) murmured, <div class="bookquote">``I could scatter
largess to the populace. But even if I am only a pretend princess, I
can invent little things to do for people. Things like this. She (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) was
just as happy as if it was largess. I'll pretend that to do things
people like is scattering largess. I've scattered largess.''

<p/>The Diamond Mines


<p/>Not very long after this a very exciting thing happened. Not only Sara,
but the entire school, found it exciting, and made it the chief subject
of conversation for weeks after it occurred. In one of his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) letters
Captain Crewe told a most interesting story. A friend who had been at
school with him (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) was a boy had unexpectedly come to see him (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) in
India. He (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) was the owner of a large tract of land upon which diamonds
had been found, and he (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) was engaged in developing the mines. If all
went as was confidently expected, he (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) would become possessed of such
wealth as it made one dizzy to think of; and because he (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) was fond of the
friend of his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) school days, he (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) had given him (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) an opportunity to share in
this enormous fortune by becoming a partner in his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) scheme. This, at
least, was what Sara gathered from his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) letters. It is true that any
other business scheme, however magnificent, would have had but small
attraction for her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) or for the schoolroom; but <div class="bookquote">``diamond mines''  (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>sounded
so like the Arabian Nights that no one could be indifferent. Sara
thought them enchanting, and painted pictures, for Ermengarde and
Lottie, of labyrinthine passages in the bowels of the earth, where
sparkling stones studded the walls and roofs and ceilings, and strange,
dark men dug them out with heavy picks. Ermengarde delighted in the
story, and Lottie insisted on its being retold to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lottie</b></font>) every evening.
Lavinia was very spiteful about it, and told Jessie that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jessie</b></font>) didn't
believe such things as diamond mines existed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My mamma has a diamond ring which cost forty pounds,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Jessie</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``And
it is not a big one, either. If there were mines full of diamonds,
people would be so rich it would be ridiculous.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps Sara will be so rich that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) will be ridiculous,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jessie</b></font>)</div>giggled
Jessie.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>)'s ridiculous without being rich,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lavinia/Lavinia Herbert</b></font>)</div>Lavinia sniffed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I believe you hate her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Jessie</b></font>)</div>said Jessie.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I don't,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lavinia/Lavinia Herbert</b></font>)</div>snapped Lavinia. <div class="bookquote">``But I don't believe in mines full of
diamonds.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, people have to get them from somewhere,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jessie</b></font>)</div>said Jessie.
<div class="bookquote">``Lavinia,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>with a new giggle, <div class="bookquote">``what do you think Gertrude says?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know, I'm sure; and I don't care if it's something more about
that everlasting Sara.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, it is. One of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) `pretends' is that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) is a princess. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>)
plays it all the time--even in school. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) says it makes her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) learn her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>)
lessons better. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) wants Ermengarde to be one, too, but Ermengarde
says she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) is too fat.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) IS too fat,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lavinia/Lavinia Herbert</b></font>)</div>said Lavinia. <div class="bookquote">``And Sara is too thin.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jessie</b></font>)</div><p/>Naturally, Jessie giggled again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) says it has nothing to do with what you look like, or what you
have. It has only to do with what you THINK of, and what you DO.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) thinks she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) could be a princess if she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) was a beggar,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Lavinia/Lavinia Herbert</b></font>)</div>said Lavinia. <div class="bookquote">``Let us begin to call her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) Your Royal Highness.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Lessons for the day were over, and they were sitting before the
schoolroom fire, enjoying the time they liked best. It was the time
when Miss Minchin and Miss Amelia were taking their tea in the sitting
room sacred to themselves. At this hour a great deal of talking was
done, and a great many secrets changed hands, particularly if the
younger pupils behaved themselves well, and did not squabble or run
about noisily, which it must be confessed they usually did. When they
made an uproar the older girls usually interfered with scolding and
shakes. They were expected to keep order, and there was danger that if
they did not, Miss Minchin or Miss Amelia would appear and put an end
to festivities. Even as Lavinia spoke the door opened and Sara entered
with Lottie, whose habit was to trot everywhere after her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) like a little
dog.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) is, with that horrid child!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lavinia/Lavinia Herbert</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Lavinia in a whisper.
<div class="bookquote">``If she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>)'s so fond of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>), why doesn't she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) own room? She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>)
will begin howling about something in five minutes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lottie/Lottie Legh</b></font>)</div><p/>It happened that Lottie had been seized with a sudden desire to play in
the schoolroom, and had begged her (<font color='blue'><b>Lottie</b></font>) adopted parent to come with her (<font color='blue'><b>Lottie</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Lottie</b></font>)
joined a group of little ones who were playing in a corner. Sara curled
herself up in the window-seat, opened a book, and began to read. It
was a book about the French Revolution, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) was soon lost in a
harrowing picture of the prisoners in the Bastille--men who had spent
so many years in dungeons that when they were dragged out by those who
rescued them, their long, gray hair and beards almost hid their faces,
and they had forgotten that an outside world existed at all, and were
like beings in a dream.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) was so far away from the schoolroom that it was not agreeable to be
dragged back suddenly by a howl from Lottie. Never did she (<font color='blue'><b>Lottie</b></font>) find
anything so difficult as to keep herself from losing her (<font color='blue'><b>Lottie</b></font>) temper when
she (<font color='blue'><b>Lottie</b></font>) was suddenly disturbed while absorbed in a book. People who are
fond of books know the feeling of irritation which sweeps over them at
such a moment. The temptation to be unreasonable and snappish is one
not easy to manage.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It makes me feel as if someone had hit me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>Sara had told Ermengarde
once in confidence. <div class="bookquote">``And as if I want to hit back. I have to remember
things quickly to keep from saying something ill-tempered.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) had to remember things quickly when she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) laid her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) book on the
window-seat and jumped down from her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) comfortable corner.

<p/>Lottie had been sliding across the schoolroom floor, and, having first
irritated Lavinia and Jessie by making a noise, had ended by falling
down and hurting her (<font color='blue'><b>Jessie</b></font>) fat knee. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jessie</b></font>) was screaming and dancing up and
down in the midst of a group of friends and enemies, who were
alternately coaxing and scolding her (<font color='blue'><b>Jessie</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Stop this minute, you cry-baby! Stop this minute!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lavinia/Lavinia Herbert</b></font>)</div>Lavinia commanded.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm not a cry-baby ... I'm not!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lottie/Lottie Legh</b></font>)</div>wailed Lottie. <div class="bookquote">``Sara, Sa--ra!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) doesn't stop, Miss Minchin will hear her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Jessie</b></font>)</div>cried Jessie.
<div class="bookquote">``Lottie darling, I'll give you a penny!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't want your penny,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lottie/Lottie Legh</b></font>)</div>sobbed Lottie; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Lottie</b></font>) looked down at the
fat knee, and, seeing a drop of blood on it, burst forth again.

<p/>Sara flew across the room and, kneeling down, put her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) arms round her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, Lottie,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Now, Lottie, you PROMISED Sara.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Lottie</b></font>) said I was a cry-baby,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lottie/Lottie Legh</b></font>)</div>wept Lottie.

<p/>Sara patted her (<font color='blue'><b>Lottie</b></font>), but spoke in the steady voice Lottie knew.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But if you cry, you will be one, Lottie pet. You PROMISED.''  (<font color='red'><b>Lottie/Lottie Legh</b></font>)</div>Lottie
remembered that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lottie</b></font>) had promised, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Lottie</b></font>) preferred to lift up her (<font color='blue'><b>Lottie</b></font>)
voice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I haven't any mamma,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Lottie</b></font>) proclaimed. <div class="bookquote">``I haven't--a bit--of mamma.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, you have,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>said Sara, cheerfully. <div class="bookquote">``Have you forgotten? Don't
you know that Sara is your mamma? Don't you want Sara for your mamma?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lottie/Lottie Legh</b></font>)</div><p/>Lottie cuddled up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lottie</b></font>) with a consoled sniff.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come and sit in the window-seat with me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>Sara went on, <div class="bookquote">``and I'll
whisper a story to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Will you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lottie/Lottie Legh</b></font>)</div>whimpered Lottie. <div class="bookquote">``Will you--tell me--about the diamond
mines?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The diamond mines?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lavinia/Lavinia Herbert</b></font>)</div>broke out Lavinia. <div class="bookquote">``Nasty, little spoiled thing,
I should like to SLAP her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div><p/>Sara got up quickly on her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) feet. It must be remembered that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) had
been very deeply absorbed in the book about the Bastille, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) had
had to recall several things rapidly when she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) realized that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) must go
and take care of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) adopted child. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) was not an angel, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) was
not fond of Lavinia.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Lavinia</b></font>) said, with some fire, <div class="bookquote">``I should like to slap YOU--but I
don't want to slap you!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>restraining herself. ``At least I both want to
slap you--and I should LIKE to slap you--but I WON<div class="bookquote">``T slap you. We are
not little gutter children. We are both old enough to know better.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lavinia/Lavinia Herbert</b></font>)</div><p/>Here was Lavinia's opportunity.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, yes, your royal highness,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Lavinia</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``We are princesses, I
believe. At least one of us is. The school ought to be very
fashionable now Miss Minchin has a princess for a pupil.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div><p/>Sara started toward her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) looked as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) were going to box her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>)
ears. Perhaps she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) was. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) trick of pretending things was the joy of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) life. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) never spoke of it to girls she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) was not fond of. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) new
<div class="bookquote">``pretend''  (<font color='red'><b>a princess</b></font>)</div>about being a princess was very near to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) heart, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>)
was shy and sensitive about it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) had meant it to be rather a
secret, and here was Lavinia deriding it before nearly all the school.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Lavinia</b></font>) felt the blood rush up into her (<font color='blue'><b>Lavinia</b></font>) face and tingle in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lavinia</b></font>) ears. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lavinia</b></font>)
only just saved herself. If you were a princess, you did not fly into
rages. Her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) hand dropped, and she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) stood quite still a moment. When she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>)
spoke it was in a quiet, steady voice; she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) held her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) head up, and
everybody listened to her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's true,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Sometimes I do pretend I am a princess. I
pretend I am a princess, so that I can try and behave like one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lavinia/Lavinia Herbert</b></font>)</div><p/>Lavinia could not think of exactly the right thing to say. Several
times she (<font color='blue'><b>Lavinia</b></font>) had found that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lavinia</b></font>) could not think of a satisfactory reply
when she (<font color='blue'><b>Lavinia</b></font>) was dealing with Sara. The reason for this was that, somehow,
the rest always seemed to be vaguely in sympathy with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) opponent. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>)
saw now that they were pricking up their ears interestedly. The truth
was, they liked princesses, and they all hoped they might hear
something more definite about this one, and drew nearer Sara
accordingly.

<p/>Lavinia could only invent one remark, and it fell rather flat.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear me,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Lavinia</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I hope, when you ascend the throne, you won't
forget us!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I won't,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>said Sara, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) did not utter another word, but stood
quite still, and stared at her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) steadily as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) take Jessie's
arm and turn away.

<p/>After this, the girls who were jealous of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) used to speak of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) as
<div class="bookquote">``Princess Sara''  (<font color='red'><b>the girls</b></font>)</div>whenever they wished to be particularly disdainful, and
those who were fond of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) the name among themselves as a term
of affection. No one called her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``princess''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Minchin/MISS MINCHIN</b></font>)</div>instead of <div class="bookquote">``Sara,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Minchin/MISS MINCHIN</b></font>)</div>but her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>)
adorers were much pleased with the picturesqueness and grandeur of the
title, and Miss Minchin, hearing of it, mentioned it more than once to
visiting parents, feeling that it rather suggested a sort of royal
boarding school.

<p/>To Becky it seemed the most appropriate thing in the world. The
acquaintance begun on the foggy afternoon when she (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) had jumped up
terrified from her (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) sleep in the comfortable chair, had ripened and
grown, though it must be confessed that Miss Minchin and Miss Amelia
knew very little about it. They were aware that Sara was <div class="bookquote">``kind''  (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>to the
scullery maid, but they knew nothing of certain delightful moments
snatched perilously when, the upstairs rooms being set in order with
lightning rapidity, Sara's sitting room was reached, and the heavy coal
box set down with a sigh of joy. At such times stories were told by
installments, things of a satisfying nature were either produced and
eaten or hastily tucked into pockets to be disposed of at night, when
Becky went upstairs to her (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) attic to bed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But I has to eat 'em careful, miss,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) said once; <div class="bookquote">''`cos if I leaves
crumbs the rats come out to get 'em.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Rats!''  (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Sara, in horror. <div class="bookquote">``Are there RATS there?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Lots of 'em, miss,''  (<font color='red'><b>Becky</b></font>)</div>Becky answered in quite a matter-of-fact manner.
<div class="bookquote">``There mostly is rats an' mice in attics. You gets used to the noise
they makes scuttling about. I've got so I don't mind 'em s' long as
they don't run over my piller.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ugh!''  (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>said Sara.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You gets used to anythin' after a bit,''  (<font color='red'><b>Becky</b></font>)</div>said Becky. <div class="bookquote">``You have to,
miss, if you're born a scullery maid. I'd rather have rats than
cockroaches.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So would I,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>said Sara; <div class="bookquote">``I suppose you might make friends with a rat
in time, but I don't believe I should like to make friends with a
cockroach.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div><p/>Sometimes Becky did not dare to spend more than a few minutes in the
bright, warm room, and when this was the case perhaps only a few words
could be exchanged, and a small purchase slipped into the old-fashioned
pocket Becky carried under her (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) dress skirt, tied round her (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) waist with a
band of tape. The search for and discovery of satisfying things to eat
which could be packed into small compass, added a new interest to
Sara's existence. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) drove or walked out, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) used to look into
shop windows eagerly. The first time it occurred to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) to bring home
two or three little meat pies, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) had hit upon a
discovery. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) exhibited them, Becky's eyes quite sparkled.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, miss!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) murmured. <div class="bookquote">``Them will be nice an' fillin.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>It's
fillin`ness that's best. Sponge cake's a `evenly thing, but it melts
away like--if you understand, miss. These'll just STAY in yer
stummick.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>hesitated Sara, <div class="bookquote">``I don't think it would be good if they stayed
always, but I do believe they will be satisfying.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div><p/>They were satisfying--and so were beef sandwiches, bought at a
cook-shop--and so were rolls and Bologna sausage. In time, Becky began
to lose her (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) hungry, tired feeling, and the coal box did not seem so
unbearably heavy.

<p/>However heavy it was, and whatsoever the temper of the cook, and the
hardness of the work heaped upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) shoulders, she (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) had always the
chance of the afternoon to look forward to--the chance that Miss Sara
would be able to be in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) sitting room. In fact, the mere seeing of
Miss Sara would have been enough without meat pies. If there was time
only for a few words, they were always friendly, merry words that put
heart into one; and if there was time for more, then there was an
installment of a story to be told, or some other thing one remembered
afterward and sometimes lay awake in one's bed in the attic to think
over. Sara--who was only doing what she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) unconsciously liked better
than anything else, Nature having made her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) for a giver--had not the
least idea what she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) meant to poor Becky, and how wonderful a benefactor
she (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) seemed. If Nature has made you for a giver, your hands are born
open, and so is your heart; and though there may be times when your
hands are empty, your heart is always full, and you can give things out
of that--warm things, kind things, sweet things--help and comfort and
laughter--and sometimes gay, kind laughter is the best help of all.

<p/>Becky had scarcely known what laughter was through all her (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) poor, little
hard-driven life. Sara made her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) laugh, and laughed with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>); and,
though neither of them quite knew it, the laughter was as <div class="bookquote">``fillin'''  (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>as
the meat pies.

<p/>A few weeks before Sara's eleventh birthday a letter came to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) from
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) father, which did not seem to be written in such boyish high
spirits as usual. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was not very well, and was evidently overweighted
by the business connected with the diamond mines.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You see, little Sara,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) wrote, <div class="bookquote">``your daddy is not a businessman at
all, and figures and documents bother him (<font color='blue'><b>businessman</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>businessman</b></font>) does not really
understand them, and all this seems so enormous. Perhaps, if I was not
feverish I should not be awake, tossing about, one half of the night
and spend the other half in troublesome dreams. If my little missus
were here, I dare say she (<font color='blue'><b>missus</b></font>) would give me some solemn, good advice. You
would, wouldn't you, Little Missus?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>One of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) many jokes had been to call her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``little missus''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>because
she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) had such an old-fashioned air.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had made wonderful preparations for her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) birthday. Among other
things, a new doll had been ordered in Paris, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) wardrobe was to
be, indeed, a marvel of splendid perfection. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) had replied to
the letter asking her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) if the doll would be an acceptable present, Sara
had been very quaint.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am getting very old,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) wrote; ``you see, I shall never live to
have another doll given me. This will be my last doll. There is
something solemn about it. If I could write poetry, I am sure a poem
about <div class="bookquote">``A Last Doll' would be very nice. But I cannot write poetry. I
have tried, and it made me laugh. It did not sound like Watts or
Coleridge or Shakespeare at all. No one could ever take Emily's place,
but I should respect the Last Doll very much; and I am sure the school
would love it. They all like dolls, though some of the big ones--the
almost fifteen ones--pretend they are too grown up.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Captain</b></font>)</div><p/>Captain Crewe had a splitting headache when he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) read this letter in his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>)
bungalow in India. The table before him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) was heaped with papers and
letters which were alarming him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) and filling him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) with anxious dread, but
he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) laughed as he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) had not laughed for weeks.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) said, ``she (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>)'s better fun every year she (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>) lives. God grant this
business may right itself and leave me free to run home and see her (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>).
What wouldn't I give to have her (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>) little arms round my neck this minute!
What WOULDN<div class="bookquote">``T I give!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The birthday was to be celebrated by great festivities. The schoolroom
was to be decorated, and there was to be a party. The boxes containing
the presents were to be opened with great ceremony, and there was to be
a glittering feast spread in Miss Minchin's sacred room. When the day
arrived the whole house was in a whirl of excitement. How the morning
passed nobody quite knew, because there seemed such preparations to be
made. The schoolroom was being decked with garlands of holly; the
desks had been moved away, and red covers had been put on the forms
which were arrayed round the room against the wall.

<p/>When Sara went into her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) sitting room in the morning, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) found on the
table a small, dumpy package, tied up in a piece of brown paper. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>)
knew it was a present, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) could guess whom it came
from. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) opened it quite tenderly. It was a square pincushion, made
of not quite clean red flannel, and black pins had been stuck carefully
into it to form the words, <div class="bookquote">``Menny hapy returns.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh!''  (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>cried Sara, with a warm feeling in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) heart. <div class="bookquote">``What pains she (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>)
has taken! I like it so, it--it makes me feel sorrowful.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>But the next moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) was mystified. On the under side of the
pincushion was secured a card, bearing in neat letters the name <div class="bookquote">``Miss
Amelia Minchin.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div><p/>Sara turned it over and over.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Amelia!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) said to herself <div class="bookquote">``How CAN it be!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>And just at that very moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) heard the door being cautiously pushed
open and saw Becky peeping round it.

<p/>There was an affectionate, happy grin on her (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) face, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) shuffled
forward and stood nervously pulling at her (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) fingers.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do yer like it, Miss Sara?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Do yer?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Like it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>cried Sara. <div class="bookquote">``You darling Becky, you made it all yourself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Becky</b></font>)</div><p/>Becky gave a hysteric but joyful sniff, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) eyes looked quite moist
with delight.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It ain't nothin' but flannin, an' the flannin ain't new; but I wanted
to give yer somethin' an' I made it of nights. I knew yer could PRETEND
it was satin with diamond pins in. _I_ tried to when I was makin' it.

 (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div><p/>Sara flew at her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) and hugged her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) could not have told herself or
anyone else why there was a lump in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) throat.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Becky!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) cried out, with a queer little laugh, <div class="bookquote">``I love you,
Becky--I do, I do!''

 (<font color='red'><b>queer</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, miss!''  (<font color='red'><b>Becky</b></font>)</div>breathed Becky. <div class="bookquote">``Thank yer, miss, kindly; it ain't good
enough for that. The--the flannin wasn't new.''

<p/>The Diamond Mines Again


<p/>When Sara entered the holly-hung schoolroom in the afternoon, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) did
so as the head of a sort of procession. Miss Minchin, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) grandest
silk dress, led her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) by the hand. A manservant followed, carrying the
box containing the Last Doll, a housemaid carried a second box, and
Becky brought up the rear, carrying a third and wearing a clean apron
and a new cap. Sara would have much preferred to enter in the usual
way, but Miss Minchin had sent for her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>), and, after an interview in her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>)
private sitting room, had expressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) wishes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This is not an ordinary occasion,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I do not desire that it
should be treated as one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div><p/>So Sara was led grandly in and felt shy when, on her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) entry, the big
girls stared at her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) and touched each other's elbows, and the little
ones began to squirm joyously in their seats.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Silence, young ladies!''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Minchin/MISS MINCHIN</b></font>)</div>said Miss Minchin, at the murmur which arose.
<div class="bookquote">``James, place the box on the table and remove the lid. Emma, put yours
upon a chair. Becky!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>suddenly and severely.

<p/>Becky had quite forgotten herself in her (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) excitement, and was grinning
at Lottie, who was wriggling with rapturous expectation. She (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) almost
dropped her (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) box, the disapproving voice so startled her (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>), and her (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>)
frightened, bobbing curtsy of apology was so funny that Lavinia and
Jessie tittered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is not your place to look at the young ladies,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Minchin/MISS MINCHIN</b></font>)</div>said Miss Minchin.
<div class="bookquote">``You forget yourself. Put your box down.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Becky</b></font>)</div><p/>Becky obeyed with alarmed haste and hastily backed toward the door.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You may leave us,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Minchin/MISS MINCHIN</b></font>)</div>Miss Minchin announced to the servants with a wave
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) hand.

<p/>Becky stepped aside respectfully to allow the superior servants to pass
out first. She (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) could not help casting a longing glance at the box on
the table. Something made of blue satin was peeping from between the
folds of tissue paper.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you please, Miss Minchin,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>said Sara, suddenly, <div class="bookquote">``mayn't Becky stay?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div><p/>It was a bold thing to do. Miss Minchin was betrayed into something
like a slight jump. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) put her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) eyeglass up, and gazed at her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>)
show pupil disturbedly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Becky!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) exclaimed. <div class="bookquote">``My dearest Sara!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div><p/>Sara advanced a step toward her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I want her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) because I know she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) will like to see the presents,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>)
explained. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) is a little girl, too, you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Minchin/MISS MINCHIN</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Minchin was scandalized. She (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) glanced from one figure to the other.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear Sara,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Becky is the scullery maid. Scullery
maids--er--are not little girls.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>It really had not occurred to her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) to think of them in that light.
Scullery maids were machines who carried coal scuttles and made fires.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But Becky is,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>said Sara. <div class="bookquote">``And I know she (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) would enjoy herself.
Please let her (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) stay--because it is my birthday.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Minchin/MISS MINCHIN</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Minchin replied with much dignity:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``As you ask it as a birthday favor--she (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) may stay. Rebecca, thank Miss
Sara for her (<font color='blue'><b>Rebecca</b></font>) great kindness.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Minchin/MISS MINCHIN</b></font>)</div><p/>Becky had been backing into the corner, twisting the hem of her (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) apron
in delighted suspense. She (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) came forward, bobbing curtsies, but between
Sara's eyes and her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) own there passed a gleam of friendly understanding,
while her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) words tumbled over each other.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, if you please, miss! I'm that grateful, miss! I did want to see
the doll, miss, that I did. Thank you, miss. And thank you,
ma'am,'' (<font color='red'><b>Miss Minchin/MISS MINCHIN</b></font>)</div>--turning and making an alarmed bob to Miss Minchin--<div class="bookquote">``for
letting me take the liberty.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Minchin/MISS MINCHIN</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Minchin waved her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) hand again--this time it was in the direction of
the corner near the door.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Go and stand there,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) commanded. <div class="bookquote">``Not too near the young ladies.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Becky</b></font>)</div><p/>Becky went to her (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) place, grinning. She (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) did not care where she (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) was
sent, so that she (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) might have the luck of being inside the room, instead
of being downstairs in the scullery, while these delights were going
on. She (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) did not even mind when Miss Minchin cleared her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) throat
ominously and spoke again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, young ladies, I have a few words to say to you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) announced.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Rebecca</b></font>)'s going to make a speech,''  (<font color='red'><b>the girls</b></font>)</div>whispered one of the girls. <div class="bookquote">``I wish it
was over.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div><p/>Sara felt rather uncomfortable. As this was her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) party, it was probable
that the speech was about her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>). It is not agreeable to stand in a
schoolroom and have a speech made about you.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are aware, young ladies,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>the speech began--for it was a
speech--<div class="bookquote">``that dear Sara is eleven years old today.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``DEAR Sara!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lavinia/Lavinia Herbert</b></font>)</div>murmured Lavinia.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Several of you here have also been eleven years old, but Sara's
birthdays are rather different from other little girls' birthdays. When
she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) is older she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) will be heiress to a large fortune, which it will be
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) duty to spend in a meritorious manner.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The diamond mines,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jessie</b></font>)</div>giggled Jessie, in a whisper.

<p/>Sara did not hear her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>); but as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) stood with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) green-gray eyes fixed
steadily on Miss Minchin, she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) felt herself growing rather hot. When
Miss Minchin talked about money, she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) felt somehow that she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) always hated
her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>)--and, of course, it was disrespectful to hate grown-up people.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``When her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) dear papa, Captain Crewe, brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) from India and gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>)
into my care,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>the speech proceeded, ``he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) said to me, in a jesting way,
``I am afraid she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) will be very rich, Miss Minchin.'' My reply was, ``Her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>)
education at my seminary, Captain Crewe, shall be such as will adorn
the largest fortune.'' Sara has become my most accomplished pupil. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>)
French and her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) dancing are a credit to the seminary. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>)
manners--which have caused you to call her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) Princess Sara--are perfect.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) amiability she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) exhibits by giving you this afternoon's party. I
hope you appreciate her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) generosity. I wish you to express your
appreciation of it by saying aloud all together, <div class="bookquote">``Thank you, Sara!'''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div><p/>The entire schoolroom rose to its feet as it had done the morning Sara
remembered so well.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you, Sara!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lottie/Lottie Legh</b></font>)</div>it said, and it must be confessed that Lottie jumped
up and down. Sara looked rather shy for a moment. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) made a
curtsy--and it was a very nice one.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``for coming to my party.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very pretty, indeed, Sara,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Minchin/MISS MINCHIN</b></font>)</div>approved Miss Minchin. <div class="bookquote">``That is what a
real princess does when the populace applauds her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>).
Lavinia'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--scathingly--<div class="bookquote">``the sound you just made was extremely like a
snort. If you are jealous of your fellow-pupil, I beg you will express
your feelings in some more lady-like manner. Now I will leave you to
enjoy yourselves.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>The instant she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) had swept out of the room the spell her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) presence always
had upon them was broken. The door had scarcely closed before every
seat was empty. The little girls jumped or tumbled out of theirs; the
older ones wasted no time in deserting theirs. There was a rush toward
the boxes. Sara had bent over one of them with a delighted face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``These are books, I know,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) said.

<p/>The little children broke into a rueful murmur, and Ermengarde looked
aghast.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Does your papa send you books for a birthday present?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) exclaimed.
<div class="bookquote">``Why, he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>)'s as bad as mine. Don't open them, Sara.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I like them,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>Sara laughed, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) turned to the biggest box. When
she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) took out the Last Doll it was so magnificent that the children
uttered delighted groans of joy, and actually drew back to gaze at it
in breathless rapture.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) is almost as big as Lottie,''  (<font color='red'><b>someone</b></font>)</div>someone gasped.

<p/>Lottie clapped her (<font color='blue'><b>Lottie</b></font>) hands and danced about, giggling.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Lottie</b></font>)'s dressed for the theater,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lavinia/Lavinia Herbert</b></font>)</div>said Lavinia. <div class="bookquote">``Her (<font color='blue'><b>Lottie</b></font>) cloak is lined
with ermine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>cried Ermengarde, darting forward, <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>Lottie</b></font>) has an opera-glass in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lottie</b></font>)
hand--a blue-and-gold one!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Here is her (<font color='blue'><b>Lottie</b></font>) trunk,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>said Sara. <div class="bookquote">``Let us open it and look at her (<font color='blue'><b>Lottie</b></font>)
things.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) sat down upon the floor and turned the key. The children crowded
clamoring around her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>), as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) lifted tray after tray and revealed their
contents. Never had the schoolroom been in such an uproar. There were
lace collars and silk stockings and handkerchiefs; there was a jewel
case containing a necklace and a tiara which looked quite as if they
were made of real diamonds; there was a long sealskin and muff, there
were ball dresses and walking dresses and visiting dresses; there were
hats and tea gowns and fans. Even Lavinia and Jessie forgot that they
were too elderly to care for dolls, and uttered exclamations of delight
and caught up things to look at them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Suppose,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>Sara said, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) stood by the table, putting a large,
black-velvet hat on the impassively smiling owner of all these
splendors--<div class="bookquote">``suppose she (<font color='blue'><b>Lottie</b></font>) understands human talk and feels proud of being
admired.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the owner</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are always supposing things,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lavinia/Lavinia Herbert</b></font>)</div>said Lavinia, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Lavinia</b></font>) air was very
superior.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I know I am,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>answered Sara, undisturbedly. <div class="bookquote">``I like it. There is
nothing so nice as supposing. It's almost like being a fairy. If you
suppose anything hard enough it seems as if it were real.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's all very well to suppose things if you have everything,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lavinia/Lavinia Herbert</b></font>)</div>said
Lavinia. <div class="bookquote">``Could you suppose and pretend if you were a beggar and lived
in a garret?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div><p/>Sara stopped arranging the Last Doll's ostrich plumes, and looked
thoughtful.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I BELIEVE I could,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``If one was a beggar, one would have to
suppose and pretend all the time. But it mightn't be easy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) often thought afterward how strange it was that just as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) had
finished saying this--just at that very moment--Miss Amelia came into
the room.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sara,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Amelia</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``your papa's solicitor, Mr. Barrow, has called to see
Miss Minchin, and, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) must talk to him (<font color='blue'><b>Barrow</b></font>) alone and the refreshments
are laid in her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) parlor, you had all better come and have your feast
now, so that my sister can have her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) interview here in the schoolroom.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Refreshments were not likely to be disdained at any hour, and many
pairs of eyes gleamed. Miss Amelia arranged the procession into
decorum, and then, with Sara at her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) side heading it, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) led it away,
leaving the Last Doll sitting upon a chair with the glories of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>)
wardrobe scattered about her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>); dresses and coats hung upon chair backs,
piles of lace-frilled petticoats lying upon their seats.

<p/>Becky, who was not expected to partake of refreshments, had the
indiscretion to linger a moment to look at these beauties--it really
was an indiscretion.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Go back to your work, Becky,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Amelia/Amelia</b></font>)</div>Miss Amelia had said; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Amelia</b></font>) had
stopped to pick up reverently first a muff and then a coat, and while
she (<font color='blue'><b>Amelia</b></font>) stood looking at them adoringly, she (<font color='blue'><b>Amelia</b></font>) heard Miss Minchin upon the
threshold, and, being smitten with terror at the thought of being
accused of taking liberties, she (<font color='blue'><b>Amelia</b></font>) rashly darted under the table, which
hid her (<font color='blue'><b>Amelia</b></font>) by its tablecloth.

<p/>Miss Minchin came into the room, accompanied by a sharp-featured, dry
little gentleman, who looked rather disturbed. Miss Minchin herself
also looked rather disturbed, it must be admitted, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) gazed at the
dry little gentleman with an irritated and puzzled expression.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) sat down with stiff dignity, and waved him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) to a chair.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Pray, be seated, Mr. Barrow,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) said.

<p/>Mr. Barrow did not sit down at once. His (<font color='blue'><b>Barrow</b></font>) attention seemed attracted by
the Last Doll and the things which surrounded her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Barrow</b></font>) settled his (<font color='blue'><b>Barrow</b></font>)
eyeglasses and looked at them in nervous disapproval. The Last Doll
herself did not seem to mind this in the least. She (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) merely sat upright
and returned his (<font color='blue'><b>Barrow</b></font>) gaze indifferently.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A hundred pounds,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Barrow</b></font>)</div>Mr. Barrow remarked succinctly. <div class="bookquote">``All expensive
material, and made at a Parisian modiste's. He (<font color='blue'><b>Barrow</b></font>) spent money lavishly
enough, that young man.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Minchin/MISS MINCHIN</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Minchin felt offended. This seemed to be a disparagement of her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>)
best patron and was a liberty.

<p/>Even solicitors had no right to take liberties.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I beg your pardon, Mr. Barrow,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) said stiffly. <div class="bookquote">``I do not
understand.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Birthday presents,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Barrow</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Barrow in the same critical manner, <div class="bookquote">``to a
child eleven years old! Mad extravagance, I call it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Barrow</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Minchin drew herself up still more rigidly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Captain Crewe is a man of fortune,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``The diamond mines
alone--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Barrow</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Barrow wheeled round upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Diamond mines!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Barrow</b></font>) broke out.
<div class="bookquote">``There are none! Never were!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Minchin/MISS MINCHIN</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Minchin actually got up from her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) chair.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) cried. <div class="bookquote">``What do you mean?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``At any rate,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Barrow</b></font>)</div>answered Mr. Barrow, quite snappishly, <div class="bookquote">``it would have
been much better if there never had been any.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Barrow</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Any diamond mines?''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Minchin/MISS MINCHIN</b></font>)</div>ejaculated Miss Minchin, catching at the back of a
chair and feeling as if a splendid dream was fading away from her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Diamond mines spell ruin oftener than they spell wealth,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Barrow</b></font>)</div>said Mr.
Barrow. <div class="bookquote">``When a man is in the hands of a very dear friend and is not a
businessman himself, he (<font color='blue'><b>businessman</b></font>) had better steer clear of the dear friend's
diamond mines, or gold mines, or any other kind of mines dear friends
want his (<font color='blue'><b>businessman</b></font>) money to put into. The late Captain Crewe--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Minchin/MISS MINCHIN</b></font>)</div><p/>Here Miss Minchin stopped him (<font color='blue'><b>Barrow</b></font>) with a gasp.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The LATE Captain Crewe!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) cried out. <div class="bookquote">``The LATE! You don't come to
tell me that Captain Crewe is--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Barrow</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>)'s dead, ma'am,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Barrow</b></font>)</div>Mr. Barrow answered with jerky brusqueness. <div class="bookquote">``Died
of jungle fever and business troubles combined. The jungle fever might
not have killed him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) had not been driven mad by the business
troubles, and the business troubles might not have put an end to him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) if
the jungle fever had not assisted. Captain Crewe is dead!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Minchin/MISS MINCHIN</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Minchin dropped into her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) chair again. The words he (<font color='blue'><b>Barrow</b></font>) had spoken
filled her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) with alarm.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What WERE his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) business troubles?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``What WERE they?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Diamond mines,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Barrow</b></font>)</div>answered Mr. Barrow, <div class="bookquote">``and dear friends--and ruin.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Barrow</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Minchin lost her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) breath.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ruin!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) gasped out.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Lost every penny. That young man had too much money. The dear friend
was mad on the subject of the diamond mine. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) put all his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) own money
into it, and all Captain Crewe's. Then the dear friend ran
away--Captain Crewe was already stricken with fever when the news came.
The shock was too much for him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) died delirious, raving about his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>)
little girl--and didn't leave a penny.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Minchin/MISS MINCHIN</b></font>)</div><p/>Now Miss Minchin understood, and never had she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) received such a blow in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) life. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) show pupil, her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) show patron, swept away from the Select
Seminary at one blow. She (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) felt as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) had been outraged and robbed,
and that Captain Crewe and Sara and Mr. Barrow were equally to blame.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you mean to tell me,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Crewe</b></font>) cried out, <div class="bookquote">``that he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) left NOTHING! That
Sara will have no fortune! That the child is a beggar! That she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) is
left on my hands a little pauper instead of an heiress?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Barrow was a shrewd businessman, and felt it as well to make his (<font color='blue'><b>Barrow</b></font>)
own freedom from responsibility quite clear without any delay.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) is certainly left a beggar,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Barrow</b></font>) replied. <div class="bookquote">``And she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) is certainly
left on your hands, ma'am--as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) hasn't a relation in the world that
we know of.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Minchin/MISS MINCHIN</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Minchin started forward. She (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) looked as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) was going to open
the door and rush out of the room to stop the festivities going on
joyfully and rather noisily that moment over the refreshments.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is monstrous!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>)'s in my sitting room at this moment,
dressed in silk gauze and lace petticoats, giving a party at my
expense.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>)'s giving it at your expense, madam, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>)'s giving it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Barrow</b></font>)</div>said Mr.
Barrow, calmly. <div class="bookquote">``Barrow & Skipworth are not responsible for anything.
There never was a cleaner sweep made of a man's fortune. Captain Crewe
died without paying OUR last bill--and it was a big one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Minchin/MISS MINCHIN</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Minchin turned back from the door in increased indignation. This
was worse than anyone could have dreamed of its being.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That is what has happened to me!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) cried. <div class="bookquote">``I was always so sure of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) payments that I went to all sorts of ridiculous expenses for the
child. I paid the bills for that ridiculous doll and her (<font color='blue'><b>Crewe</b></font>) ridiculous
fantastic wardrobe. The child was to have anything she (<font color='blue'><b>Crewe</b></font>) wanted. She (<font color='blue'><b>Crewe</b></font>)
has a carriage and a pony and a maid, and I've paid for all of them
since the last cheque came.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Barrow</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Barrow evidently did not intend to remain to listen to the story of
Miss Minchin's grievances after he (<font color='blue'><b>Barrow</b></font>) had made the position of his (<font color='blue'><b>Barrow</b></font>) firm
clear and related the mere dry facts. He (<font color='blue'><b>Barrow</b></font>) did not feel any particular
sympathy for irate keepers of boarding schools.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You had better not pay for anything more, ma'am,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Barrow</b></font>) remarked, <div class="bookquote">``unless
you want to make presents to the young lady. No one will remember you.
She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) hasn't a brass farthing to call her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) own.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But what am I to do?''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Minchin/MISS MINCHIN</b></font>)</div>demanded Miss Minchin, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) felt it
entirely his (<font color='blue'><b>Barrow</b></font>) duty to make the matter right. <div class="bookquote">``What am I to do?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There isn't anything to do,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Barrow</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Barrow, folding up his (<font color='blue'><b>Barrow</b></font>)
eyeglasses and slipping them into his (<font color='blue'><b>Barrow</b></font>) pocket. <div class="bookquote">``Captain Crewe is dead.
The child is left a pauper. Nobody is responsible for her (<font color='blue'><b>Crewe</b></font>) but you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not responsible for her (<font color='blue'><b>Crewe</b></font>), and I refuse to be made responsible!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Minchin/MISS MINCHIN</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Minchin became quite white with rage.

<p/>Mr. Barrow turned to go.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have nothing to do with that, madam,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Barrow</b></font>) said uninterestedly.
<div class="bookquote">``Barrow & Skipworth are not responsible. Very sorry the thing has
happened, of course.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you think she (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>) is to be foisted off on me, you are greatly
mistaken,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Minchin/MISS MINCHIN</b></font>)</div>Miss Minchin gasped. <div class="bookquote">``I have been robbed and cheated; I
will turn her (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>) into the street!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>If she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) had not been so furious, she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) would have been too discreet to say
quite so much. She (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) saw herself burdened with an extravagantly
brought-up child whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) had always resented, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) lost all
self-control.

<p/>Mr. Barrow undisturbedly moved toward the door.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wouldn't do that, madam,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Barrow</b></font>) commented; <div class="bookquote">``it wouldn't look well.
Unpleasant story to get about in connection with the establishment.
Pupil bundled out penniless and without friends.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Barrow</b></font>) was a clever business man, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Barrow</b></font>) knew what he (<font color='blue'><b>Barrow</b></font>) was saying. He (<font color='blue'><b>Barrow</b></font>) also
knew that Miss Minchin was a business woman, and would be shrewd enough
to see the truth. She (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) could not afford to do a thing which would make
people speak of her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) as cruel and hard-hearted.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Better keep her (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>) and make use of her (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Barrow</b></font>) added. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>)'s a clever
child, I believe. You can get a good deal out of her (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>) grows
older.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will get a good deal out of her (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>) before she (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>) grows older!''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Minchin/MISS MINCHIN</b></font>)</div>exclaimed
Miss Minchin.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sure you will, ma'am,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Barrow</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Barrow, with a little sinister
smile. <div class="bookquote">``I am sure you will. Good morning!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Barrow</b></font>) bowed himself out and closed the door, and it must be confessed that
Miss Minchin stood for a few moments and glared at it. What he (<font color='blue'><b>Barrow</b></font>) had
said was quite true. She (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) knew it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) had absolutely no redress. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>)
show pupil had melted into nothingness, leaving only a friendless,
beggared little girl. Such money as she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) herself had advanced was lost
and could not be regained.

<p/>And as she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) stood there breathless under her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) sense of injury, there fell
upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) ears a burst of gay voices from her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) own sacred room, which had
actually been given up to the feast. She (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) could at least stop this.

<p/>But as she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) started toward the door it was opened by Miss Amelia, who,
when she (<font color='blue'><b>Amelia</b></font>) caught sight of the changed, angry face, fell back a step in
alarm.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What IS the matter, sister?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Amelia</b></font>) ejaculated.

<p/>Miss Minchin's voice was almost fierce when she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) answered:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where is Sara Crewe?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Amelia was bewildered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sara!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Amelia</b></font>) stammered. <div class="bookquote">``Why, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>)'s with the children in your room, of
course.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Has she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) a black frock in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) sumptuous wardrobe?'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--in bitter irony.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A black frock?''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Amelia/Amelia</b></font>)</div>Miss Amelia stammered again. <div class="bookquote">``A BLACK one?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) has frocks of every other color. Has she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) a black one?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Amelia/Amelia</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Amelia began to turn pale.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No--ye-es!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Amelia</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``But it is too short for her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) has only the
old black velvet, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) has outgrown it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Go and tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) to take off that preposterous pink silk gauze, and put
the black one on, whether it is too short or not. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) has done with
finery!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Amelia/Amelia</b></font>)</div><p/>Then Miss Amelia began to wring her (<font color='blue'><b>Amelia</b></font>) fat hands and cry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, sister!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Amelia</b></font>) sniffed. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, sister! What CAN have happened?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Minchin/MISS MINCHIN</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Minchin wasted no words.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Captain Crewe is dead,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) has died without a penny. That
spoiled, pampered, fanciful child is left a pauper on my hands.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Amelia/Amelia</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Amelia sat down quite heavily in the nearest chair.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hundreds of pounds have I spent on nonsense for her (<font color='blue'><b>Crewe</b></font>). And I shall
never see a penny of it. Put a stop to this ridiculous party of hers.
Go and make her (<font color='blue'><b>Crewe</b></font>) change her (<font color='blue'><b>Crewe</b></font>) frock at once.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I?''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Amelia/Amelia</b></font>)</div>panted Miss Amelia. <div class="bookquote">``M-must I go and tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Crewe</b></font>) now?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``This moment!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was the fierce answer. <div class="bookquote">``Don't sit staring like a goose.
Go!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Amelia/Amelia</b></font>)</div><p/>Poor Miss Amelia was accustomed to being called a goose. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amelia</b></font>) knew, in
fact, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Amelia</b></font>) was rather a goose, and that it was left to geese to do
a great many disagreeable things. It was a somewhat embarrassing thing
to go into the midst of a room full of delighted children, and tell the
giver of the feast that she (<font color='blue'><b>Amelia</b></font>) had suddenly been transformed into a little
beggar, and must go upstairs and put on an old black frock which was
too small for her (<font color='blue'><b>Amelia</b></font>). But the thing must be done. This was evidently not
the time when questions might be asked.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Amelia</b></font>) rubbed her (<font color='blue'><b>Amelia</b></font>) eyes with her (<font color='blue'><b>Amelia</b></font>) handkerchief until they looked quite red.
After which she (<font color='blue'><b>Amelia</b></font>) got up and went out of the room, without venturing to
say another word. When her (<font color='blue'><b>Amelia</b></font>) older sister looked and spoke as she (<font color='blue'><b>Amelia</b></font>) had
done just now, the wisest course to pursue was to obey orders without
any comment. Miss Minchin walked across the room. She (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) spoke to herself
aloud without knowing that she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) was doing it. During the last year the
story of the diamond mines had suggested all sorts of possibilities to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>). Even proprietors of seminaries might make fortunes in stocks,
with the aid of owners of mines. And now, instead of looking forward to
gains, she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) was left to look back upon losses.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The Princess Sara, indeed!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``The child has been pampered as
if she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) were a QUEEN.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) was sweeping angrily past the corner table as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) said it, and the next moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) started at the sound of a loud,
sobbing sniff which issued from under the cover.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is that!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) exclaimed angrily. The loud, sobbing sniff was
heard again, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) stooped and raised the hanging folds of the table
cover.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How DARE you!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) cried out. <div class="bookquote">``How dare you! Come out immediately!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Becky</b></font>)</div><p/>It was poor Becky who crawled out, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) cap was knocked on one side,
and her (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) face was red with repressed crying.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you please, 'm--it's me, mum,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) explained. <div class="bookquote">``I know I hadn't
ought to. But I was lookin' at the doll, mum--an' I was frightened
when you come in--an' slipped under the table.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You have been there all the time, listening,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Minchin/MISS MINCHIN</b></font>)</div>said Miss Minchin.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, mum,''  (<font color='red'><b>Becky</b></font>)</div>Becky protested, bobbing curtsies. <div class="bookquote">``Not listenin'--I
thought I could slip out without your noticin', but I couldn't an' I
had to stay. But I didn't listen, mum--I wouldn't for nothin'. But I
couldn't help hearin'.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Suddenly it seemed almost as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) lost all fear of the awful lady
before her (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) burst into fresh tears.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, please, 'm,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``I dare say you'll give me warnin', mum--but
I'm so sorry for poor Miss Sara--I'm so sorry!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Leave the room!''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Minchin/MISS MINCHIN</b></font>)</div>ordered Miss Minchin.

<p/>Becky curtsied again, the tears openly streaming down her (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) cheeks.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, 'm; I will, 'm,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) said, trembling; <div class="bookquote">``but oh, I just wanted to
arst you: Miss Sara--she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>)'s been such a rich young lady, an' she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)'s been
waited on, `and and foot; an' what will she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) do now, mum, without no
maid? If--if, oh please, would you let me wait on her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) after I've done
my pots an' kettles? I'd do 'em that quick--if you'd let me wait on
her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) now she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)'s poor. Oh,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>breaking out afresh, <div class="bookquote">``poor little Miss Sara,
mum--that was called a princess.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Somehow, she (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) made Miss Minchin feel more angry than ever. That the
very scullery maid should range herself on the side of this child--whom
she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) realized more fully than ever that she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) had never liked--was too
much. She (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) actually stamped her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) foot.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No--certainly not,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) will wait on herself, and on other
people, too. Leave the room this instant, or you'll leave your place.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Becky</b></font>)</div><p/>Becky threw her (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) apron over her (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) head and fled. She (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) ran out of the room
and down the steps into the scullery, and there she (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) sat down among her (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>)
pots and kettles, and wept as if her (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) heart would break.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's exactly like the ones in the stories,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) wailed. <div class="bookquote">``Them pore
princess ones that was drove into the world.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Minchin/MISS MINCHIN</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Minchin had never looked quite so still and hard as she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) did when
Sara came to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>), a few hours later, in response to a message she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) had
sent her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>).

<p/>Even by that time it seemed to Sara as if the birthday party had either
been a dream or a thing which had happened years ago, and had happened
in the life of quite another little girl.

<p/>Every sign of the festivities had been swept away; the holly had been
removed from the schoolroom walls, and the forms and desks put back
into their places. Miss Minchin's sitting room looked as it always
did--all traces of the feast were gone, and Miss Minchin had resumed
her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) usual dress. The pupils had been ordered to lay aside their party
frocks; and this having been done, they had returned to the schoolroom
and huddled together in groups, whispering and talking excitedly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell Sara to come to my room,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Minchin/MISS MINCHIN</b></font>)</div>Miss Minchin had said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) sister.
<div class="bookquote">``And explain to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) clearly that I will have no crying or unpleasant
scenes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sister,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Amelia/Amelia</b></font>)</div>replied Miss Amelia, <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>Sister</b></font>) is the strangest child I ever saw.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Sister</b></font>) has actually made no fuss at all. You remember she (<font color='blue'><b>Sister</b></font>) made none when
Captain Crewe went back to India. When I told her (<font color='blue'><b>Crewe</b></font>) what had happened,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Crewe</b></font>) just stood quite still and looked at me without making a sound.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>Crewe</b></font>) eyes seemed to get bigger and bigger, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Crewe</b></font>) went quite pale.
When I had finished, she (<font color='blue'><b>Crewe</b></font>) still stood staring for a few seconds, and
then her (<font color='blue'><b>Crewe</b></font>) chin began to shake, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Crewe</b></font>) turned round and ran out of the
room and upstairs. Several of the other children began to cry, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Crewe</b></font>)
did not seem to hear them or to be alive to anything but just what I
was saying. It made me feel quite queer not to be answered; and when
you tell anything sudden and strange, you expect people will say
SOMETHING--whatever it is.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Amelia/Amelia</b></font>)</div><p/>Nobody but Sara herself ever knew what had happened in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) room after
she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) had run upstairs and locked her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) door. In fact, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) herself
scarcely remembered anything but that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) walked up and down, saying
over and over again to herself in a voice which did not seem her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) own,
<div class="bookquote">``My papa is dead! My papa is dead!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Once she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) stopped before Emily, who sat watching her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) from her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) chair, and
cried out wildly, <div class="bookquote">``Emily! Do you hear? Do you hear--papa is dead? He (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>)
is dead in India--thousands of miles away.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Emily</b></font>)</div><p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) came into Miss Minchin's sitting room in answer to her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>)
summons, her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) face was white and her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) eyes had dark rings around them.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) mouth was set as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) did not wish it to reveal what she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) had
suffered and was suffering. She (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) did not look in the least like the
rose-colored butterfly child who had flown about from one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>)
treasures to the other in the decorated schoolroom. She (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) looked instead
a strange, desolate, almost grotesque little figure.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) had put on, without Mariette's help, the cast-aside black-velvet
frock. It was too short and tight, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) slender legs looked long
and thin, showing themselves from beneath the brief skirt. As she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) had
not found a piece of black ribbon, her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) short, thick, black hair tumbled
loosely about her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) face and contrasted strongly with its pallor. She (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>)
held Emily tightly in one arm, and Emily was swathed in a piece of
black material.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Put down your doll,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Minchin/MISS MINCHIN</b></font>)</div>said Miss Minchin. <div class="bookquote">``What do you mean by bringing
her (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>) here?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>Sara answered. <div class="bookquote">``I will not put her (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>) down. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>) is all I have. My
papa gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>) to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) had always made Miss Minchin feel secretly uncomfortable, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>)
did so now. She (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) did not speak with rudeness so much as with a cold
steadiness with which Miss Minchin felt it difficult to cope--perhaps
because she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) knew she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) was doing a heartless and inhuman thing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You will have no time for dolls in future,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``You will have
to work and improve yourself and make yourself useful.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div><p/>Sara kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) big, strange eyes fixed on her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>), and said not a word.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Everything will be very different now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Minchin/MISS MINCHIN</b></font>)</div>Miss Minchin went on. <div class="bookquote">``I
suppose Miss Amelia has explained matters to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>answered Sara. <div class="bookquote">``My papa is dead. He (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) left me no money. I am
quite poor.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are a beggar,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Minchin/MISS MINCHIN</b></font>)</div>said Miss Minchin, her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) temper rising at the
recollection of what all this meant. <div class="bookquote">``It appears that you have no
relations and no home, and no one to take care of you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div><p/>For a moment the thin, pale little face twitched, but Sara again said
nothing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What are you staring at?''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Minchin/MISS MINCHIN</b></font>)</div>demanded Miss Minchin, sharply. <div class="bookquote">``Are you so
stupid that you cannot understand? I tell you that you are quite alone
in the world, and have no one to do anything for you, unless I choose
to keep you here out of charity.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I understand,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>answered Sara, in a low tone; and there was a sound as
if she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) had gulped down something which rose in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) throat. <div class="bookquote">``I
understand.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That doll,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Minchin/MISS MINCHIN</b></font>)</div>cried Miss Minchin, pointing to the splendid birthday gift
seated near--<div class="bookquote">``that ridiculous doll, with all her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) nonsensical,
extravagant things--I actually paid the bill for her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Minchin/MISS MINCHIN</b></font>)</div><p/>Sara turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) head toward the chair.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The Last Doll,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``The Last Doll.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>And her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) little mournful
voice had an odd sound.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The Last Doll, indeed!''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Minchin/MISS MINCHIN</b></font>)</div>said Miss Minchin. <div class="bookquote">``And she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) is mine, not
yours. Everything you own is mine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Please take it away from me, then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>said Sara. <div class="bookquote">``I do not want it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>If she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) had cried and sobbed and seemed frightened, Miss Minchin might
almost have had more patience with her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) was a woman who liked to
domineer and feel her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) power, and as she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) looked at Sara's pale little
steadfast face and heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) proud little voice, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) quite felt as if
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) might was being set at naught.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't put on grand airs,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``The time for that sort of thing
is past. You are not a princess any longer. Your carriage and your
pony will be sent away--your maid will be dismissed. You will wear your
oldest and plainest clothes--your extravagant ones are no longer suited
to your station. You are like Becky--you must work for your living.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the child</b></font>)</div><p/>To her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) surprise, a faint gleam of light came into the child's eyes--a
shade of relief.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Can I work?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``If I can work it will not matter so much.
What can I do?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You can do anything you are told,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was the answer. <div class="bookquote">``You are a sharp
child, and pick up things readily. If you make yourself useful I may
let you stay here. You speak French well, and you can help with the
younger children.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``May I?''  (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Sara. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, please let me! I know I can teach them.
I like them, and they like me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't talk nonsense about people liking you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Minchin/MISS MINCHIN</b></font>)</div>said Miss Minchin. <div class="bookquote">``You
will have to do more than teach the little ones. You will run errands
and help in the kitchen as well as in the schoolroom. If you don't
please me, you will be sent away. Remember that. Now go.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div><p/>Sara stood still just a moment, looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>). In her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) young soul, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>)
was thinking deep and strange things. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) turned to leave the
room.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Stop!''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Minchin/MISS MINCHIN</b></font>)</div>said Miss Minchin. <div class="bookquote">``Don't you intend to thank me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div><p/>Sara paused, and all the deep, strange thoughts surged up in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) breast.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What for?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``For my kindness to you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Minchin/MISS MINCHIN</b></font>)</div>replied Miss Minchin. <div class="bookquote">``For my kindness in
giving you a home.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div><p/>Sara made two or three steps toward her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>). Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) thin little chest heaved
up and down, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) spoke in a strange un-childishly fierce way.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are not kind,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``You are NOT kind, and it is NOT a
home.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) had turned and run out of the room before Miss Minchin
could stop her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) or do anything but stare after her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) with stony anger.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) went up the stairs slowly, but panting for breath and she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) held
Emily tightly against her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) side.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish she (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) could talk,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) said to herself. <div class="bookquote">``If she (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) could speak--if
she (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) could speak!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) meant to go to her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) room and lie down on the tiger-skin, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>)
cheek upon the great cat's head, and look into the fire and think and
think and think. But just before she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) reached the landing Miss Amelia
came out of the door and closed it behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Amelia</b></font>), and stood before it,
looking nervous and awkward. The truth was that she (<font color='blue'><b>Amelia</b></font>) felt secretly
ashamed of the thing she (<font color='blue'><b>Amelia</b></font>) had been ordered to do.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You--you are not to go in there,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Amelia</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not go in?''  (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Sara, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) fell back a pace.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That is not your room now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Amelia/Amelia</b></font>)</div>Miss Amelia answered, reddening a little.

<p/>Somehow, all at once, Sara understood. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) realized that this was the
beginning of the change Miss Minchin had spoken of.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where is my room?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) asked, hoping very much that her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) voice did not
shake.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are to sleep in the attic next to Becky.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div><p/>Sara knew where it was. Becky had told her (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) about it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) turned, and
mounted up two flights of stairs. The last one was narrow, and covered
with shabby strips of old carpet. She (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) felt as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) were walking away
and leaving far behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) the world in which that other child, who no
longer seemed herself, had lived. This child, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) short, tight old
frock, climbing the stairs to the attic, was quite a different creature.

<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) reached the attic door and opened it, her (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) heart gave a dreary
little thump. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) shut the door and stood against it and looked
about her (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>).

<p/>Yes, this was another world. The room had a slanting roof and was
whitewashed. The whitewash was dingy and had fallen off in places.
There was a rusty grate, an old iron bedstead, and a hard bed covered
with a faded coverlet. Some pieces of furniture too much worn to be
used downstairs had been sent up. Under the skylight in the roof,
which showed nothing but an oblong piece of dull gray sky, there stood
an old battered red footstool. Sara went to it and sat down. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>)
seldom cried. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) did not cry now. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) laid Emily across her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) knees
and put her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) face down upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) arms around her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>), and sat there,
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) little black head resting on the black draperies, not saying one
word, not making one sound.

<p/>And as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) sat in this silence there came a low tap at the door--such a
low, humble one that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) did not at first hear it, and, indeed, was not
roused until the door was timidly pushed open and a poor tear-smeared
face appeared peeping round it. It was Becky's face, and Becky had
been crying furtively for hours and rubbing her (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) eyes with her (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) kitchen
apron until she (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) looked strange indeed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, miss,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) said under her (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) breath. <div class="bookquote">``Might I--would you allow
me--jest to come in?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div><p/>Sara lifted her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) head and looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) tried to begin a smile,
and somehow she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) could not. Suddenly--and it was all through the loving
mournfulness of Becky's streaming eyes--her (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) face looked more like a
child's not so much too old for her (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) years. She (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) held out her (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) hand and
gave a little sob.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Becky,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I told you we were just the same--only two
little girls--just two little girls. You see how true it is. There's
no difference now. I'm not a princess anymore.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Becky</b></font>)</div><p/>Becky ran to her (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) and caught her (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) hand, and hugged it to her (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) breast,
kneeling beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) and sobbing with love and pain.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, miss, you are,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) cried, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) words were all broken.
<div class="bookquote">``Whats`ever `appens to you--whats`ever--you'd be a princess all the
same--an' nothin' couldn't make you nothin' different.''



 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>8

<p/>In the Attic


<p/>The first night she (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) spent in her (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) attic was a thing Sara never forgot.
During its passing she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) lived through a wild, unchildlike woe of which
she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) never spoke to anyone about her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>). There was no one who would have
understood. It was, indeed, well for her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) that as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) lay awake in the
darkness her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) mind was forcibly distracted, now and then, by the
strangeness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) surroundings. It was, perhaps, well for her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) was reminded by her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) small body of material things. If this had not
been so, the anguish of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) young mind might have been too great for a
child to bear. But, really, while the night was passing she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) scarcely
knew that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) had a body at all or remembered any other thing than one.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My papa is dead!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) kept whispering to herself. <div class="bookquote">``My papa is dead!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>It was not until long afterward that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) realized that her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) bed had been
so hard that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) turned over and over in it to find a place to rest,
that the darkness seemed more intense than any she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) had ever known, and
that the wind howled over the roof among the chimneys like something
which wailed aloud. Then there was something worse. This was certain
scufflings and scratchings and squeakings in the walls and behind the
skirting boards. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) knew what they meant, because Becky had described
them. They meant rats and mice who were either fighting with each
other or playing together. Once or twice she (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) even heard sharp-toed feet
scurrying across the floor, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) remembered in those after days,
when she (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) recalled things, that when first she (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) heard them she (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) started up
in bed and sat trembling, and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) lay down again covered her (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) head
with the bedclothes.

<p/>The change in her (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) life did not come about gradually, but was made all
at once.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) must begin as she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) is to go on,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Minchin/MISS MINCHIN</b></font>)</div>Miss Minchin said to Miss Amelia.
<div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) must be taught at once what she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) is to expect.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mariette</b></font>)</div><p/>Mariette had left the house the next morning. The glimpse Sara caught
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) sitting room, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) passed its open door, showed her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) that
everything had been changed. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) ornaments and luxuries had been
removed, and a bed had been placed in a corner to transform it into a
new pupil's bedroom.

<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) went down to breakfast she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) saw that her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) seat at Miss Minchin's
side was occupied by Lavinia, and Miss Minchin spoke to her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) coldly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You will begin your new duties, Sara,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``by taking your seat
with the younger children at a smaller table. You must keep them
quiet, and see that they behave well and do not waste their food. You
ought to have been down earlier. Lottie has already upset her (<font color='blue'><b>Lottie</b></font>) tea.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>That was the beginning, and from day to day the duties given to her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>)
were added to. She (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) taught the younger children French and heard their
other lessons, and these were the least of her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) labors. It was found
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) could be made use of in numberless directions. She (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) could be
sent on errands at any time and in all weathers. She (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) could be told to
do things other people neglected. The cook and the housemaids took
their tone from Miss Minchin, and rather enjoyed ordering about the
<div class="bookquote">``young one''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Minchin/MISS MINCHIN</b></font>)</div>who had been made so much fuss over for so long. They were
not servants of the best class, and had neither good manners nor good
tempers, and it was frequently convenient to have at hand someone on
whom blame could be laid.

<p/>During the first month or two, Sara thought that her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) willingness to do
things as well as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) could, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) silence under reproof, might
soften those who drove her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) so hard. In her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) proud little heart she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>)
wanted them to see that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) was trying to earn her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) living and not
accepting charity. But the time came when she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) saw that no one was
softened at all; and the more willing she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) was to do as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) was told,
the more domineering and exacting careless housemaids became, and the
more ready a scolding cook was to blame her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>).

<p/>If she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) had been older, Miss Minchin would have given her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) the bigger
girls to teach and saved money by dismissing an instructress; but while
she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) remained and looked like a child, she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) could be made more useful as
a sort of little superior errand girl and maid of all work. An ordinary
errand boy would not have been so clever and reliable. Sara could be
trusted with difficult commissions and complicated messages. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) could
even go and pay bills, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) combined with this the ability to dust a
room well and to set things in order.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) own lessons became things of the past. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) was taught nothing, and
only after long and busy days spent in running here and there at
everybody's orders was she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) grudgingly allowed to go into the deserted
schoolroom, with a pile of old books, and study alone at night.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If I do not remind myself of the things I have learned, perhaps I may
forget them,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) said to herself. ``I am almost a scullery maid, and
if I am a scullery maid who knows nothing, I shall be like poor Becky.
I wonder if I could QUITE forget and begin to drop my H<div class="bookquote">``S and not
remember that Henry the Eighth had six wives.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the pupils</b></font>)</div><p/>One of the most curious things in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) new existence was her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) changed
position among the pupils. Instead of being a sort of small royal
personage among them, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) no longer seemed to be one of their number at
all. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) was kept so constantly at work that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) scarcely ever had an
opportunity of speaking to any of them, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) could not avoid seeing
that Miss Minchin preferred that she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) should live a life apart from that
of the occupants of the schoolroom.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I will not have her (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) forming intimacies and talking to the other
children,''  (<font color='red'><b>lady</b></font>)</div>that lady said. <div class="bookquote">``Girls like a grievance, and if she (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) begins
to tell romantic stories about herself, she (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) will become an ill-used
heroine, and parents will be given a wrong impression. It is better
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) should live a separate life--one suited to her (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) circumstances.
I am giving her (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) a home, and that is more than she (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) has any right to
expect from me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div><p/>Sara did not expect much, and was far too proud to try to continue to
be intimate with girls who evidently felt rather awkward and uncertain
about her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>). The fact was that Miss Minchin's pupils were a set of dull,
matter-of-fact young people. They were accustomed to being rich and
comfortable, and as Sara's frocks grew shorter and shabbier and
queerer-looking, and it became an established fact that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) wore shoes
with holes in them and was sent out to buy groceries and carry them
through the streets in a basket on her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) arm when the cook wanted them in
a hurry, they felt rather as if, when they spoke to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>), they were
addressing an under servant.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``To think that she (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) was the girl with the diamond mines,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lavinia/Lavinia Herbert</b></font>)</div>Lavinia
commented. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) does look an object. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>)'s queerer than ever. I
never liked her (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) much, but I can't bear that way she (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) has now of looking
at people without speaking--just as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) was finding them out.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>said Sara, promptly, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) heard of this. <div class="bookquote">``That's what I
look at some people for. I like to know about them. I think them over
afterward.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>The truth was that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) had saved herself annoyance several times by
keeping her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) eye on Lavinia, who was quite ready to make mischief, and
would have been rather pleased to have made it for the ex-show pupil.

<p/>Sara never made any mischief herself, or interfered with anyone. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>)
worked like a drudge; she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) tramped through the wet streets, carrying
parcels and baskets; she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) labored with the childish inattention of the
little ones' French lessons; as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) became shabbier and more
forlorn-looking, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) was told that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) had better take her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) meals
downstairs; she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) was treated as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) was nobody's concern, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>)
heart grew proud and sore, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) never told anyone what she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) felt.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Soldiers don't complain,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) would say between her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) small, shut teeth,
<div class="bookquote">``I am not going to do it; I will pretend this is part of a war.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>But there were hours when her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) child heart might almost have broken with
loneliness but for three people.

<p/>The first, it must be owned, was Becky--just Becky. Throughout all
that first night spent in the garret, she (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) had felt a vague comfort in
knowing that on the other side of the wall in which the rats scuffled
and squeaked there was another young human creature. And during the
nights that followed the sense of comfort grew. They had little chance
to speak to each other during the day. Each had her (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) own tasks to
perform, and any attempt at conversation would have been regarded as a
tendency to loiter and lose time. <div class="bookquote">``Don't mind me, miss,''  (<font color='red'><b>Becky</b></font>)</div>Becky
whispered during the first morning, <div class="bookquote">``if I don't say nothin' polite.
Some un'd be down on us if I did. I MEANS `please' an' `thank you' an'
`beg pardon,''  (<font color='red'><b>Becky</b></font>)</div>but I dassn't to take time to say it.''

<p/>But before daybreak she (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) used to slip into Sara's attic and button her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>)
dress and give her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) such help as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) required before she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) went downstairs
to light the kitchen fire. And when night came Sara always heard the
humble knock at her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) door which meant that her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) handmaid was ready to
help her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) again if she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) was needed. During the first weeks of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) grief
Sara felt as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) were too stupefied to talk, so it happened that
some time passed before they saw each other much or exchanged visits.
Becky's heart told her (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) that it was best that people in trouble should
be left alone.

<p/>The second of the trio of comforters was Ermengarde, but odd things
happened before Ermengarde found her (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) place.

<p/>When Sara's mind seemed to awaken again to the life about her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>)
realized that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) had forgotten that an Ermengarde lived in the world.
The two had always been friends, but Sara had felt as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) were years
the older. It could not be contested that Ermengarde was as dull as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) was affectionate. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) clung to Sara in a simple, helpless way; she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>)
brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) lessons to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) might be helped; she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) listened to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) every word and besieged her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) with requests for stories. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) had
nothing interesting to say herself, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) loathed books of every
description. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) was, in fact, not a person one would remember when
one was caught in the storm of a great trouble, and Sara forgot her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>).

<p/>It had been all the easier to forget her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) because she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) had been suddenly
called home for a few weeks. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) came back she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) did not see Sara
for a day or two, and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) met her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) for the first time she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>)
encountered her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) coming down a corridor with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) arms full of garments
which were to be taken downstairs to be mended. Sara herself had
already been taught to mend them. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) looked pale and unlike herself,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) was attired in the queer, outgrown frock whose shortness showed
so much thin black leg.

<p/>Ermengarde was too slow a girl to be equal to such a situation. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
could not think of anything to say. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) knew what had happened, but,
somehow, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had never imagined Sara could look like this--so odd and
poor and almost like a servant. It made her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) quite miserable, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>)
could do nothing but break into a short hysterical laugh and
exclaim--aimlessly and as if without any meaning, <div class="bookquote">``Oh, Sara, is that
you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>answered Sara, and suddenly a strange thought passed through her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>)
mind and made her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) face flush. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) held the pile of garments in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>)
arms, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) chin rested upon the top of it to keep it steady.
Something in the look of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) straight-gazing eyes made Ermengarde lose
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) wits still more. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) felt as if Sara had changed into a new kind
of girl, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) had never known her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) before. Perhaps it was because she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>)
had suddenly grown poor and had to mend things and work like Becky.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) stammered. <div class="bookquote">``How--how are you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>Sara replied. <div class="bookquote">``How are you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm--I'm quite well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ermengarde/John/Ermengarde St. John</b></font>)</div>said Ermengarde, overwhelmed with shyness. Then
spasmodically she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) thought of something to say which seemed more
intimate. <div class="bookquote">``Are you--are you very unhappy?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) said in a rush.

<p/>Then Sara was guilty of an injustice. Just at that moment her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) torn
heart swelled within her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) felt that if anyone was as stupid as
that, one had better get away from her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you think?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Do you think I am very happy?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>)
marched past her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) without another word.

<p/>In course of time she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) realized that if her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) wretchedness had not made
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) forget things, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) would have known that poor, dull Ermengarde was
not to be blamed for her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) unready, awkward ways. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) was always
awkward, and the more she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) felt, the more stupid she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) was given to being.

<p/>But the sudden thought which had flashed upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) had made her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>)
over-sensitive.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) is like the others,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) had thought. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) does not really want
to talk to me. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) knows no one does.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>So for several weeks a barrier stood between them. When they met by
chance Sara looked the other way, and Ermengarde felt too stiff and
embarrassed to speak. Sometimes they nodded to each other in passing,
but there were times when they did not even exchange a greeting.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) would rather not talk to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>Sara thought, <div class="bookquote">``I will keep out of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) way. Miss Minchin makes that easy enough.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Minchin made it so easy that at last they scarcely saw each other
at all. At that time it was noticed that Ermengarde was more stupid
than ever, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) looked listless and unhappy. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) used to sit
in the window-seat, huddled in a heap, and stare out of the window
without speaking. Once Jessie, who was passing, stopped to look at her (<font color='blue'><b>Jessie</b></font>)
curiously.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What are you crying for, Ermengarde?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Jessie</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm not crying,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ermengarde/John/Ermengarde St. John</b></font>)</div>answered Ermengarde, in a muffled, unsteady voice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jessie</b></font>)</div>said Jessie. <div class="bookquote">``A great big tear just rolled down the bridge
of your nose and dropped off at the end of it. And there goes another.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ermengarde/John/Ermengarde St. John</b></font>)</div>said Ermengarde, <div class="bookquote">``I'm miserable--and no one need interfere.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ermengarde/John/Ermengarde St. John</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Jessie</b></font>) turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Jessie</b></font>) plump back and took out her (<font color='blue'><b>Jessie</b></font>) handkerchief and boldly
hid her (<font color='blue'><b>Jessie</b></font>) face in it.

<p/>That night, when Sara went to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) attic, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) was later than usual. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>)
had been kept at work until after the hour at which the pupils went to
bed, and after that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) had gone to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) lessons in the lonely
schoolroom. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) reached the top of the stairs, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) was surprised
to see a glimmer of light coming from under the attic door.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nobody goes there but myself,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) thought quickly, <div class="bookquote">``but someone has
lighted a candle.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Someone had, indeed, lighted a candle, and it was not burning in the
kitchen candlestick she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) was expected to use, but in one of those
belonging to the pupils' bedrooms. The someone was sitting upon the
battered footstool, and was dressed in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) nightgown and wrapped up in
a red shawl. It was Ermengarde.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ermengarde!''  (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>cried Sara. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) was so startled that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) was almost
frightened. <div class="bookquote">``You will get into trouble.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ermengarde/John/Ermengarde St. John</b></font>)</div><p/>Ermengarde stumbled up from her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) footstool. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) shuffled across the
attic in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) bedroom slippers, which were too large for her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>). Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) eyes
and nose were pink with crying.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I know I shall--if I'm found out.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``But I don't care--I
don't care a bit. Oh, Sara, please tell me. What is the matter? Why
don't you like me any more?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div><p/>Something in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) voice made the familiar lump rise in Sara's throat. It
was so affectionate and simple--so like the old Ermengarde who had
asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) to be <div class="bookquote">``best friends.''  (<font color='red'><b>Ermengarde/John/Ermengarde St. John</b></font>)</div>It sounded as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) had not meant
what she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) had seemed to mean during these past weeks.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I do like you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>Sara answered. <div class="bookquote">``I thought--you see, everything is
different now. I thought you--were different.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ermengarde/John/Ermengarde St. John</b></font>)</div><p/>Ermengarde opened her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) wet eyes wide.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, it was you who were different!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) cried. <div class="bookquote">``You didn't want to
talk to me. I didn't know what to do. It was you who were different
after I came back.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div><p/>Sara thought a moment. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) saw she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) had made a mistake.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I AM different,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) explained, <div class="bookquote">``though not in the way you think. Miss
Minchin does not want me to talk to the girls. Most of them don't want
to talk to me. I thought--perhaps--you didn't. So I tried to keep out
of your way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Sara,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Ermengarde almost wailed in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) reproachful dismay. And
then after one more look they rushed into each other's arms. It must
be confessed that Sara's small black head lay for some minutes on the
shoulder covered by the red shawl. When Ermengarde had seemed to
desert her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) had felt horribly lonely.

<p/>Afterward they sat down upon the floor together, Sara clasping her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>)
knees with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) arms, and Ermengarde rolled up in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) shawl. Ermengarde
looked at the odd, big-eyed little face adoringly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I couldn't bear it any more,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I dare say you could live
without me, Sara; but I couldn't live without you. I was nearly DEAD.
So tonight, when I was crying under the bedclothes, I thought all at
once of creeping up here and just begging you to let us be friends
again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are nicer than I am,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>said Sara. <div class="bookquote">``I was too proud to try and make
friends. You see, now that trials have come, they have shown that I am
NOT a nice child. I was afraid they would. Perhaps'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--wrinkling her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>)
forehead wisely--<div class="bookquote">``that is what they were sent for.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't see any good in them,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ermengarde/John/Ermengarde St. John</b></font>)</div>said Ermengarde stoutly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Neither do I--to speak the truth,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>admitted Sara, frankly. <div class="bookquote">``But I
suppose there MIGHT be good in things, even if we don't see it. There
MIGHT'' (<font color='red'><b>Ermengarde/John/Ermengarde St. John</b></font>)</div>--doubtfully--<div class="bookquote">``be good in Miss Minchin.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ermengarde/John/Ermengarde St. John</b></font>)</div><p/>Ermengarde looked round the attic with a rather fearsome curiosity.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sara,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``do you think you can bear living here?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Sara looked round also.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If I pretend it's quite different, I can,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) answered; <div class="bookquote">``or if I
pretend it is a place in a story.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) spoke slowly. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) imagination was beginning to work for her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>). It
had not worked for her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) at all since her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) troubles had come upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>)
had felt as if it had been stunned.

<p/>``Other people have lived in worse places. Think of the Count of Monte
Cristo in the dungeons of the Chateau d<div class="bookquote">``If. And think of the people in
the Bastille!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The Bastille,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ermengarde/John/Ermengarde St. John</b></font>)</div>half whispered Ermengarde, watching her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) and beginning
to be fascinated. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) remembered stories of the French Revolution
which Sara had been able to fix in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) mind by her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) dramatic relation of
them. No one but Sara could have done it.

<p/>A well-known glow came into Sara's eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) said, hugging her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) knees, <div class="bookquote">``that will be a good place to
pretend about. I am a prisoner in the Bastille. I have been here for
years and years--and years; and everybody has forgotten about me. Miss
Minchin is the jailer--and Becky'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--a sudden light adding itself to the
glow in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) eyes--<div class="bookquote">``Becky is the prisoner in the next cell.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) turned to Ermengarde, looking quite like the old Sara.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall pretend that,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``and it will be a great comfort.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Ermengarde was at once enraptured and awed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And will you tell me all about it?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``May I creep up here at
night, whenever it is safe, and hear the things you have made up in the
day? It will seem as if we were more `best friends' than ever.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>answered Sara, nodding. <div class="bookquote">``Adversity tries people, and mine has
tried you and proved how nice you are.''



 (<font color='red'><b>Melchisedec Lottie</b></font>)</div><p/>9

<p/>Melchisedec


<p/>The third person in the trio was Lottie. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) was a small thing and did
not know what adversity meant, and was much bewildered by the
alteration she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) saw in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) young adopted mother. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) had heard it
rumored that strange things had happened to Sara, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) could not
understand why she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) looked different--why she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) wore an old black frock
and came into the schoolroom only to teach instead of to sit in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>)
place of honor and learn lessons herself. There had been much
whispering among the little ones when it had been discovered that Sara
no longer lived in the rooms in which Emily had so long sat in state.
Lottie's chief difficulty was that Sara said so little when one asked
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) questions. At seven mysteries must be made very clear if one is to
understand them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you very poor now, Sara?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) had asked confidentially the first
morning her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) friend took charge of the small French class. <div class="bookquote">``Are you as
poor as a beggar?''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) thrust a fat hand into the slim one and opened
round, tearful eyes. <div class="bookquote">``I don't want you to be as poor as a beggar.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) looked as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) was going to cry. And Sara hurriedly consoled her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Beggars have nowhere to live,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) said courageously. <div class="bookquote">``I have a place
to live in.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Where do you live?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lottie/Lottie Legh</b></font>)</div>persisted Lottie. <div class="bookquote">``The new girl sleeps in your
room, and it isn't pretty any more.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I live in another room,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>said Sara.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it a nice one?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lottie/Lottie Legh</b></font>)</div>inquired Lottie. <div class="bookquote">``I want to go and see it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You must not talk,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>said Sara. <div class="bookquote">``Miss Minchin is looking at us. She (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>)
will be angry with me for letting you whisper.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) had found out already that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) was to be held accountable for
everything which was objected to. If the children were not attentive,
if they talked, if they were restless, it was she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) who would be reproved.

<p/>But Lottie was a determined little person. If Sara would not tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>)
where she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) lived, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) would find out in some other way. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) talked to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) small companions and hung about the elder girls and listened when
they were gossiping; and acting upon certain information they had
unconsciously let drop, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) started late one afternoon on a voyage of
discovery, climbing stairs she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) had never known the existence of, until
she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) reached the attic floor. There she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) found two doors near each other,
and opening one, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) beloved Sara standing upon an old table
and looking out of a window.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sara!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) cried, aghast. <div class="bookquote">``Mamma Sara!''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) was aghast because the
attic was so bare and ugly and seemed so far away from all the world.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) short legs had seemed to have been mounting hundreds of stairs.

<p/>Sara turned round at the sound of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) voice. It was her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) turn to be
aghast. What would happen now? If Lottie began to cry and any one
chanced to hear, they were both lost. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lottie</b></font>) jumped down from her (<font color='blue'><b>Lottie</b></font>) table
and ran to the child.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't cry and make a noise,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Lottie</b></font>) implored. <div class="bookquote">``I shall be scolded if you
do, and I have been scolded all day. It's--it's not such a bad room,
Lottie.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Isn't it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lottie/Lottie Legh</b></font>)</div>gasped Lottie, and as she (<font color='blue'><b>Lottie</b></font>) looked round it she (<font color='blue'><b>Lottie</b></font>) bit her (<font color='blue'><b>Lottie</b></font>) lip.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Lottie</b></font>) was a spoiled child yet, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Lottie</b></font>) was fond enough of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lottie</b></font>) adopted
parent to make an effort to control herself for her (<font color='blue'><b>Lottie</b></font>) sake. Then,
somehow, it was quite possible that any place in which Sara lived might
turn out to be nice. <div class="bookquote">``Why isn't it, Sara?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) almost whispered.

<p/>Sara hugged her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) close and tried to laugh. There was a sort of comfort
in the warmth of the plump, childish body. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) had had a hard day and
had been staring out of the windows with hot eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You can see all sorts of things you can't see downstairs,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What sort of things?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lottie/Lottie Legh</b></font>)</div>demanded Lottie, with that curiosity Sara could
always awaken even in bigger girls.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Chimneys--quite close to us--with smoke curling up in wreaths and
clouds and going up into the sky--and sparrows hopping about and
talking to each other just as if they were people--and other attic
windows where heads may pop out any minute and you can wonder who they
belong to. And it all feels as high up--as if it was another world.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, let me see it!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lottie/Lottie Legh</b></font>)</div>cried Lottie. <div class="bookquote">``Lift me up!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div><p/>Sara lifted her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) up, and they stood on the old table together and leaned
on the edge of the flat window in the roof, and looked out.

<p/>Anyone who has not done this does not know what a different world they
saw. The slates spread out on either side of them and slanted down
into the rain gutter-pipes. The sparrows, being at home there,
twittered and hopped about quite without fear. Two of them perched on
the chimney top nearest and quarrelled with each other fiercely until
one pecked the other and drove him (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) away. The garret window next to
theirs was shut because the house next door was empty.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish someone lived there,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>Sara said. <div class="bookquote">``It is so close that if there
was a little girl in the attic, we could talk to each other through the
windows and climb over to see each other, if we were not afraid of
falling.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lottie/Lottie Legh</b></font>)</div><p/>The sky seemed so much nearer than when one saw it from the street,
that Lottie was enchanted. From the attic window, among the chimney
pots, the things which were happening in the world below seemed almost
unreal. One scarcely believed in the existence of Miss Minchin and
Miss Amelia and the schoolroom, and the roll of wheels in the square
seemed a sound belonging to another existence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Sara!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lottie/Lottie Legh</b></font>)</div>cried Lottie, cuddling in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lottie</b></font>) guarding arm. <div class="bookquote">``I like this
attic--I like it! It is nicer than downstairs!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Look at that sparrow,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>whispered Sara. <div class="bookquote">``I wish I had some crumbs to
throw to him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have some!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lottie/Lottie Legh</b></font>)</div>came in a little shriek from Lottie. <div class="bookquote">``I have part of a
bun in my pocket; I bought it with my penny yesterday, and I saved a
bit.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>When they threw out a few crumbs the sparrow jumped and flew away to an
adjacent chimney top. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lottie</b></font>) was evidently not accustomed to intimates in
attics, and unexpected crumbs startled him (<font color='blue'><b>Lottie</b></font>). But when Lottie remained
quite still and Sara chirped very softly--almost as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) were a
sparrow herself--he (<font color='blue'><b>Lottie</b></font>) saw that the thing which had alarmed him (<font color='blue'><b>Lottie</b></font>)
represented hospitality, after all. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lottie</b></font>) put his (<font color='blue'><b>Lottie</b></font>) head on one side, and
from his (<font color='blue'><b>Lottie</b></font>) perch on the chimney looked down at the crumbs with twinkling
eyes. Lottie could scarcely keep still.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Will he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) come? Will he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) come?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Lottie</b></font>) whispered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``His (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) eyes look as if he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) would,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>Sara whispered back. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) is thinking
and thinking whether he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) dare. Yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) will! Yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) is coming!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Lottie</b></font>) flew down and hopped toward the crumbs, but stopped a few inches
away from them, putting his (<font color='blue'><b>Lottie</b></font>) head on one side again, as if reflecting on
the chances that Sara and Lottie might turn out to be big cats and jump
on him (<font color='blue'><b>Lottie</b></font>). At last his (<font color='blue'><b>Lottie</b></font>) heart told him (<font color='blue'><b>Lottie</b></font>) they were really nicer than they
looked, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Lottie</b></font>) hopped nearer and nearer, darted at the biggest crumb
with a lightning peck, seized it, and carried it away to the other side
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lottie</b></font>) chimney.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) KNOWS'' (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>, said Sara. <div class="bookquote">``And he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) will come back for the others.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Lottie</b></font>) did come back, and even brought a friend, and the friend went away
and brought a relative, and among them they made a hearty meal over
which they twittered and chattered and exclaimed, stopping every now
and then to put their heads on one side and examine Lottie and Sara.
Lottie was so delighted that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lottie</b></font>) quite forgot her (<font color='blue'><b>Lottie</b></font>) first shocked
impression of the attic. In fact, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Lottie</b></font>) was lifted down from the
table and returned to earthly things, as it were, Sara was able to
point out to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) many beauties in the room which she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) herself would not
have suspected the existence of.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is so little and so high above everything,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``that it is
almost like a nest in a tree. The slanting ceiling is so funny. See,
you can scarcely stand up at this end of the room; and when the morning
begins to come I can lie in bed and look right up into the sky through
that flat window in the roof. It is like a square patch of light. If
the sun is going to shine, little pink clouds float about, and I feel
as if I could touch them. And if it rains, the drops patter and patter
as if they were saying something nice. Then if there are stars, you
can lie and try to count how many go into the patch. It takes such a
lot. And just look at that tiny, rusty grate in the corner. If it was
polished and there was a fire in it, just think how nice it would be.
You see, it's really a beautiful little room.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) was walking round the small place, holding Lottie's hand and making
gestures which described all the beauties she (<font color='blue'><b>Lottie</b></font>) was making herself see.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Lottie</b></font>) quite made Lottie see them, too. Lottie could always believe in
the things Sara made pictures of.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You see,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``there could be a thick, soft blue Indian rug on
the floor; and in that corner there could be a soft little sofa, with
cushions to curl up on; and just over it could be a shelf full of books
so that one could reach them easily; and there could be a fur rug
before the fire, and hangings on the wall to cover up the whitewash,
and pictures. They would have to be little ones, but they could be
beautiful; and there could be a lamp with a deep rose-colored shade;
and a table in the middle, with things to have tea with; and a little
fat copper kettle singing on the hob; and the bed could be quite
different. It could be made soft and covered with a lovely silk
coverlet. It could be beautiful. And perhaps we could coax the
sparrows until we made such friends with them that they would come and
peck at the window and ask to be let in.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Sara!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lottie/Lottie Legh</b></font>)</div>cried Lottie. <div class="bookquote">``I should like to live here!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div><p/>When Sara had persuaded her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) to go downstairs again, and, after setting
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) on her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) way, had come back to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) attic, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) stood in the middle of
it and looked about her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>). The enchantment of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) imaginings for Lottie
had died away. The bed was hard and covered with its dingy quilt. The
whitewashed wall showed its broken patches, the floor was cold and
bare, the grate was broken and rusty, and the battered footstool,
tilted sideways on its injured leg, the only seat in the room. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lottie</b></font>) sat
down on it for a few minutes and let her (<font color='blue'><b>Lottie</b></font>) head drop in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lottie</b></font>) hands. The
mere fact that Lottie had come and gone away again made things seem a
little worse--just as perhaps prisoners feel a little more desolate
after visitors come and go, leaving them behind.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's a lonely place,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Lottie</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Sometimes it's the loneliest place
in the world.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lottie</b></font>) was sitting in this way when her (<font color='blue'><b>Lottie</b></font>) attention was attracted by a
slight sound near her (<font color='blue'><b>Lottie</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Lottie</b></font>) lifted her (<font color='blue'><b>Lottie</b></font>) head to see where it came from,
and if she (<font color='blue'><b>Lottie</b></font>) had been a nervous child she (<font color='blue'><b>Lottie</b></font>) would have left her (<font color='blue'><b>Lottie</b></font>) seat on the
battered footstool in a great hurry. A large rat was sitting up on his (<font color='blue'><b>Lottie</b></font>)
hind quarters and sniffing the air in an interested manner. Some of
Lottie's crumbs had dropped upon the floor and their scent had drawn
him (<font color='blue'><b>Lottie</b></font>) out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lottie</b></font>) hole.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Lottie</b></font>) looked so queer and so like a gray-whiskered dwarf or gnome that
Sara was rather fascinated. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lottie</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>Lottie</b></font>) bright eyes, as
if he (<font color='blue'><b>Lottie</b></font>) were asking a question. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lottie</b></font>) was evidently so doubtful that one of
the child's queer thoughts came into her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) mind.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I dare say it is rather hard to be a rat,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) mused. ``Nobody likes
you. People jump and run away and scream out, ``Oh, a horrid rat!'' I
shouldn't like people to scream and jump and say, ``Oh, a horrid Sara!''
the moment they saw me. And set traps for me, and pretend they were
dinner. It's so different to be a sparrow. But nobody asked this rat
if he (<font color='blue'><b>Lottie</b></font>) wanted to be a rat when he (<font color='blue'><b>Lottie</b></font>) was made. Nobody said, <div class="bookquote">``Wouldn't you
rather be a sparrow?'''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) had sat so quietly that the rat had begun to take courage. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lottie</b></font>) was
very much afraid of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>), but perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Lottie</b></font>) had a heart like the sparrow
and it told him (<font color='blue'><b>Lottie</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) was not a thing which pounced. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lottie</b></font>) was very
hungry. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lottie</b></font>) had a wife and a large family in the wall, and they had had
frightfully bad luck for several days. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lottie</b></font>) had left the children crying
bitterly, and felt he (<font color='blue'><b>Lottie</b></font>) would risk a good deal for a few crumbs, so he (<font color='blue'><b>Lottie</b></font>)
cautiously dropped upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Lottie</b></font>) feet.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come on,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>said Sara; <div class="bookquote">``I'm not a trap. You can have them, poor thing!
Prisoners in the Bastille used to make friends with rats. Suppose I
make friends with you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div><p/>How it is that animals understand things I do not know, but it is
certain that they do understand. Perhaps there is a language which is
not made of words and everything in the world understands it. Perhaps
there is a soul hidden in everything and it can always speak, without
even making a sound, to another soul. But whatsoever was the reason,
the rat knew from that moment that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lottie</b></font>) was safe--even though he (<font color='blue'><b>Lottie</b></font>) was a
rat. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lottie</b></font>) knew that this young human being sitting on the red footstool
would not jump up and terrify him (<font color='blue'><b>Lottie</b></font>) with wild, sharp noises or throw
heavy objects at him (<font color='blue'><b>Lottie</b></font>) which, if they did not fall and crush him (<font color='blue'><b>Lottie</b></font>), would
send him (<font color='blue'><b>Lottie</b></font>) limping in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lottie</b></font>) scurry back to his (<font color='blue'><b>Lottie</b></font>) hole. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lottie</b></font>) was really a very
nice rat, and did not mean the least harm. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Lottie</b></font>) had stood on his (<font color='blue'><b>Lottie</b></font>)
hind legs and sniffed the air, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Lottie</b></font>) bright eyes fixed on Sara, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lottie</b></font>)
had hoped that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) would understand this, and would not begin by hating
him (<font color='blue'><b>Lottie</b></font>) as an enemy. When the mysterious thing which speaks without saying
any words told him (<font color='blue'><b>Lottie</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) would not, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lottie</b></font>) went softly toward the crumbs
and began to eat them. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Lottie</b></font>) did it he (<font color='blue'><b>Lottie</b></font>) glanced every now and then at
Sara, just as the sparrows had done, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Lottie</b></font>) expression was so very
apologetic that it touched her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) heart.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) sat and watched him (<font color='blue'><b>Lottie</b></font>) without making any movement. One crumb was
very much larger than the others--in fact, it could scarcely be called
a crumb. It was evident that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lottie</b></font>) wanted that piece very much, but it
lay quite near the footstool and he (<font color='blue'><b>Lottie</b></font>) was still rather timid.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I believe he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) wants it to carry to his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) family in the wall,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>Sara
thought. <div class="bookquote">``If I do not stir at all, perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) will come and get it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) scarcely allowed herself to breathe, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) was so deeply interested.
The rat shuffled a little nearer and ate a few more crumbs, then he (<font color='blue'><b>Lottie</b></font>)
stopped and sniffed delicately, giving a side glance at the occupant of
the footstool; then he (<font color='blue'><b>Lottie</b></font>) darted at the piece of bun with something very
like the sudden boldness of the sparrow, and the instant he (<font color='blue'><b>Lottie</b></font>) had
possession of it fled back to the wall, slipped down a crack in the
skirting board, and was gone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I knew he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) wanted it for his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) children,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>said Sara. <div class="bookquote">``I do believe I
could make friends with him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ermengarde/John/Ermengarde St. John</b></font>)</div><p/>A week or so afterward, on one of the rare nights when Ermengarde found
it safe to steal up to the attic, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) tapped on the door with the
tips of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) fingers Sara did not come to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) for two or three minutes.
There was, indeed, such a silence in the room at first that Ermengarde
wondered if she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) could have fallen asleep. Then, to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) surprise, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>)
heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) utter a little, low laugh and speak coaxingly to someone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There!''  (<font color='red'><b>Ermengarde/John/Ermengarde St. John</b></font>)</div>Ermengarde heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) say. <div class="bookquote">``Take it and go home, Melchisedec!
Go home to your wife!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div><p/>Almost immediately Sara opened the door, and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) did so she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) found
Ermengarde standing with alarmed eyes upon the threshold.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who--who ARE you talking to, Sara?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) gasped out.

<p/>Sara drew her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) in cautiously, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) looked as if something pleased and
amused her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You must promise not to be frightened--not to scream the least bit, or
I can't tell you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) answered.

<p/>Ermengarde felt almost inclined to scream on the spot, but managed to
control herself. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) looked all round the attic and saw no one. And
yet Sara had certainly been speaking TO someone. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) thought of ghosts.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it--something that will frighten me?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) asked timorously.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Some people are afraid of them,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>said Sara. <div class="bookquote">``I was at first--but I am
not now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Was it--a ghost?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>quaked Ermengarde.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>said Sara, laughing. <div class="bookquote">``It was my rat.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ermengarde/John/Ermengarde St. John</b></font>)</div><p/>Ermengarde made one bound, and landed in the middle of the little dingy
bed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) tucked her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) feet under her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) nightgown and the red shawl. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>)
did not scream, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) gasped with fright.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! Oh!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) cried under her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) breath. <div class="bookquote">``A rat! A rat!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I was afraid you would be frightened,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>said Sara. <div class="bookquote">``But you needn't
be. I am making him (<font color='blue'><b>people</b></font>) tame. He (<font color='blue'><b>people</b></font>) actually knows me and comes out when I
call him (<font color='blue'><b>people</b></font>). Are you too frightened to want to see him (<font color='blue'><b>people</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>The truth was that, as the days had gone on and, with the aid of scraps
brought up from the kitchen, her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) curious friendship had developed, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>)
had gradually forgotten that the timid creature she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) was becoming
familiar with was a mere rat.

<p/>At first Ermengarde was too much alarmed to do anything but huddle in a
heap upon the bed and tuck up her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) feet, but the sight of Sara's
composed little countenance and the story of Melchisedec's first
appearance began at last to rouse her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) curiosity, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) leaned forward
over the edge of the bed and watched Sara go and kneel down by the hole
in the skirting board.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>people</b></font>)--he (<font color='blue'><b>people</b></font>) won't run out quickly and jump on the bed, will he (<font color='blue'><b>people</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>answered Sara. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>people</b></font>)'s as polite as we are. He (<font color='blue'><b>people</b></font>) is just like a
person. Now watch!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) began to make a low, whistling sound--so low and coaxing that it
could only have been heard in entire stillness. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) did it several
times, looking entirely absorbed in it. Ermengarde thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) looked
as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) were working a spell. And at last, evidently in response to
it, a gray-whiskered, bright-eyed head peeped out of the hole. Sara
had some crumbs in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) hand. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) dropped them, and Melchisedec came
quietly forth and ate them. A piece of larger size than the rest he (<font color='blue'><b>Ermengarde</b></font>)
took and carried in the most businesslike manner back to his (<font color='blue'><b>Ermengarde</b></font>) home.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You see,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>said Sara, <div class="bookquote">``that is for his (<font color='blue'><b>people</b></font>) wife and children. He (<font color='blue'><b>people</b></font>) is very
nice. He (<font color='blue'><b>people</b></font>) only eats the little bits. After he (<font color='blue'><b>people</b></font>) goes back I can always
hear his (<font color='blue'><b>people</b></font>) family squeaking for joy. There are three kinds of squeaks.
One kind is the children's, and one is Mrs. Melchisedec's, and one is
Melchisedec's own.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div><p/>Ermengarde began to laugh.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Sara!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``You ARE queer--but you are nice.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know I am queer,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>admitted Sara, cheerfully; <div class="bookquote">``and I TRY to be nice.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) rubbed her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) forehead with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) little brown paw, and a puzzled,
tender look came into her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) face. <div class="bookquote">``Papa always laughed at me,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) said;
<div class="bookquote">``but I liked it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>) thought I was queer, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>) liked me to make up
things. I--I can't help making up things. If I didn't, I don't
believe I could live.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) paused and glanced around the attic. <div class="bookquote">``I'm
sure I couldn't live here,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) added in a low voice.

<p/>Ermengarde was interested, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) always was. <div class="bookquote">``When you talk about
things,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``they seem as if they grew real. You talk about
Melchisedec as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>) was a person.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>) IS a person,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>said Sara. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>) gets hungry and frightened, just as
we do; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>) is married and has children. How do we know he (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>) doesn't
think things, just as we do? His (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>) eyes look as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>) was a person.
That was why I gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>) a name.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) sat down on the floor in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) favorite attitude, holding her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) knees.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Besides,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>) is a Bastille rat sent to be my friend. I can
always get a bit of bread the cook has thrown away, and it is quite
enough to support him (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it the Bastille yet?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ermengarde/John/Ermengarde St. John</b></font>)</div>asked Ermengarde, eagerly. <div class="bookquote">``Do you always
pretend it is the Bastille?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nearly always,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>answered Sara. <div class="bookquote">``Sometimes I try to pretend it is
another kind of place; but the Bastille is generally
easiest--particularly when it is cold.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Just at that moment Ermengarde almost jumped off the bed, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) was so
startled by a sound she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) heard. It was like two distinct knocks on the
wall.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is that?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) exclaimed.

<p/>Sara got up from the floor and answered quite dramatically:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is the prisoner in the next cell.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Becky!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>cried Ermengarde, enraptured.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>said Sara. ``Listen; the two knocks meant, <div class="bookquote">``Prisoner, are you
there?'''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) knocked three times on the wall herself, as if in answer.

<p/>``That means, <div class="bookquote">``Yes, I am here, and all is well.'''

 (<font color='red'><b>Becky</b></font>)</div><p/>Four knocks came from Becky's side of the wall.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That means,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>explained Sara, <div class="bookquote">''`Then, fellow-sufferer, we will sleep in
peace. Good night.'''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div><p/>Ermengarde quite beamed with delight.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Sara!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) whispered joyfully. <div class="bookquote">``It is like a story!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It IS a story,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>said Sara. <div class="bookquote">``EVERYTHING'S a story. You are a story--I
am a story. Miss Minchin is a story.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) sat down again and talked until Ermengarde forgot that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) was
a sort of escaped prisoner herself, and had to be reminded by Sara that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) could not remain in the Bastille all night, but must steal
noiselessly downstairs again and creep back into her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) deserted bed.



<p/>10

<p/>The Indian Gentleman


<p/>But it was a perilous thing for Ermengarde and Lottie to make
pilgrimages to the attic. They could never be quite sure when Sara
would be there, and they could scarcely ever be certain that Miss
Amelia would not make a tour of inspection through the bedrooms after
the pupils were supposed to be asleep. So their visits were rare ones,
and Sara lived a strange and lonely life. It was a lonelier life when
she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) was downstairs than when she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) was in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) attic. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) had no one to
talk to; and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) was sent out on errands and walked through the
streets, a forlorn little figure carrying a basket or a parcel, trying
to hold her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) hat on when the wind was blowing, and feeling the water
soak through her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) shoes when it was raining, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) felt as if the crowds
hurrying past her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) made her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) loneliness greater. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) had been the
Princess Sara, driving through the streets in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) brougham, or walking,
attended by Mariette, the sight of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) bright, eager little face and
picturesque coats and hats had often caused people to look after her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>).
A happy, beautifully cared for little girl naturally attracts
attention. Shabby, poorly dressed children are not rare enough and
pretty enough to make people turn around to look at them and smile. No
one looked at Sara in these days, and no one seemed to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>)
hurried along the crowded pavements. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) had begun to grow very fast,
and, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) was dressed only in such clothes as the plainer remnants of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) wardrobe would supply, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) knew she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) looked very queer, indeed. All
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) valuable garments had been disposed of, and such as had been left
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) use she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) was expected to wear so long as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) could put them on
at all. Sometimes, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) passed a shop window with a mirror in it,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) almost laughed outright on catching a glimpse of herself, and
sometimes her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) face went red and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) bit her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) lip and turned away.

<p/>In the evening, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) passed houses whose windows were lighted up,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) used to look into the warm rooms and amuse herself by imagining
things about the people she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) saw sitting before the fires or about the
tables. It always interested her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) to catch glimpses of rooms before the
shutters were closed. There were several families in the square in
which Miss Minchin lived, with which she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) had become quite familiar in a
way of her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) own. The one she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) liked best she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) called the Large Family.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) called it the Large Family not because the members of it were
big--for, indeed, most of them were little--but because there were so
many of them. There were eight children in the Large Family, and a
stout, rosy mother, and a stout, rosy father, and a stout, rosy
grandmother, and any number of servants. The eight children were always
either being taken out to walk or to ride in perambulators by
comfortable nurses, or they were going to drive with their mamma, or
they were flying to the door in the evening to meet their papa and kiss
him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) and dance around him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) and drag off his (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) overcoat and look in the
pockets for packages, or they were crowding about the nursery windows
and looking out and pushing each other and laughing--in fact, they were
always doing something enjoyable and suited to the tastes of a large
family. Sara was quite fond of them, and had given them names out of
books--quite romantic names. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) called them the Montmorencys when she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>)
did not call them the Large Family. The fat, fair baby with the lace
cap was Ethelberta Beauchamp Montmorency; the next baby was Violet
Cholmondeley Montmorency; the little boy who could just stagger and who
had such round legs was Sydney Cecil Vivian Montmorency; and then came
Lilian Evangeline Maud Marion, Rosalind Gladys, Guy Clarence, Veronica
Eustacia, and Claude Harold Hector.

<p/>One evening a very funny thing happened--though, perhaps, in one sense
it was not a funny thing at all.

<p/>Several of the Montmorencys were evidently going to a children's party,
and just as Sara was about to pass the door they were crossing the
pavement to get into the carriage which was waiting for them. Veronica
Eustacia and Rosalind Gladys, in white-lace frocks and lovely sashes,
had just got in, and Guy Clarence, aged five, was following them. He (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>)
was such a pretty fellow and had such rosy cheeks and blue eyes, and
such a darling little round head covered with curls, that Sara forgot
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) basket and shabby cloak altogether--in fact, forgot everything but
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) wanted to look at him (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) for a moment. So she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) paused and looked.

<p/>It was Christmas time, and the Large Family had been hearing many
stories about children who were poor and had no mammas and papas to
fill their stockings and take them to the pantomime--children who were,
in fact, cold and thinly clad and hungry. In the stories, kind
people--sometimes little boys and girls with tender hearts--invariably
saw the poor children and gave them money or rich gifts, or took them
home to beautiful dinners. Guy Clarence had been affected to tears
that very afternoon by the reading of such a story, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) had burned
with a desire to find such a poor child and give her (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) a certain sixpence
he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) possessed, and thus provide for her (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) for life. An entire sixpence, he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>)
was sure, would mean affluence for evermore. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) crossed the strip of
red carpet laid across the pavement from the door to the carriage, he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>)
had this very sixpence in the pocket of his (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) very short man-o-war
trousers; And just as Rosalind Gladys got into the vehicle and jumped
on the seat in order to feel the cushions spring under her (<font color='blue'><b>Gladys</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) saw Sara
standing on the wet pavement in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) shabby frock and hat, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) old
basket on her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) arm, looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) hungrily.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) thought that her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) eyes looked hungry because she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) had perhaps had
nothing to eat for a long time. He (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) did not know that they looked so
because she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) was hungry for the warm, merry life his (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) home held and his (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>)
rosy face spoke of, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) had a hungry wish to snatch him (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>)
arms and kiss him (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) only knew that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) had big eyes and a thin face
and thin legs and a common basket and poor clothes. So he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) put his (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) hand
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) pocket and found his (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) sixpence and walked up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) benignly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here, poor little girl,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Here is a sixpence. I will give it
to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div><p/>Sara started, and all at once realized that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) looked exactly like
poor children she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) had seen, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) better days, waiting on the pavement
to watch her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) got out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) brougham. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) had given them
pennies many a time. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) face went red and then it went pale, and for
a second she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) felt as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) could not take the dear little sixpence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, no!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, no, thank you; I mustn't take it, indeed!''

 (<font color='red'><b>an street child</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) voice was so unlike an ordinary street child's voice and her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) manner
was so like the manner of a well-bred little person that Veronica
Eustacia -LRB-whose real name was Janet-RRB- and Rosalind Gladys -LRB-who was
really called Nora-RRB- leaned forward to listen.

<p/>But Guy Clarence was not to be thwarted in his (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) benevolence. He (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) thrust
the sixpence into her (<font color='blue'><b>Gladys</b></font>) hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, you must take it, poor little girl!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) insisted stoutly. <div class="bookquote">``You
can buy things to eat with it. It is a whole sixpence!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>There was something so honest and kind in his (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) face, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) looked so
likely to be heartbrokenly disappointed if she (<font color='blue'><b>Gladys</b></font>) did not take it, that
Sara knew she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) must not refuse him (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>). To be as proud as that would be a
cruel thing. So she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) actually put her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) pride in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) pocket, though it
must be admitted her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) cheeks burned.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``You are a kind, kind little darling thing.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And as he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) scrambled joyfully into the carriage she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) went away, trying to
smile, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) caught her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) breath quickly and her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) eyes were shining
through a mist. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) had known that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) looked odd and shabby, but
until now she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) had not known that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) might be taken for a beggar.

<p/>As the Large Family's carriage drove away, the children inside it were
talking with interested excitement.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Donald,''  (<font color='red'><b>Guy Clarence</b></font>)</div>-LRB-this was Guy Clarence's name-RRB-, Janet exclaimed
alarmedly, <div class="bookquote">``why did you offer that little girl your sixpence? I'm sure
she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) is not a beggar!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Janet</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) didn't speak like a beggar!''  (<font color='red'><b>Nora</b></font>)</div>cried Nora. <div class="bookquote">``And her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) face didn't
really look like a beggar's face!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Besides, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) didn't beg,''  (<font color='red'><b>Janet</b></font>)</div>said Janet. <div class="bookquote">``I was so afraid she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) might be
angry with you. You know, it makes people angry to be taken for
beggars when they are not beggars.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) wasn't angry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Donald</b></font>)</div>said Donald, a trifle dismayed, but still firm.
<div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) laughed a little, and she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) said I was a kind, kind little darling
thing. And I was!'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--stoutly. <div class="bookquote">``It was my whole sixpence.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Janet</b></font>)</div><p/>Janet and Nora exchanged glances.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A beggar girl would never have said that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Janet</b></font>)</div>decided Janet. ``She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) would
have said, <div class="bookquote">``Thank yer kindly, little gentleman--thank yer, sir;' and
perhaps she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) would have bobbed a curtsy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div><p/>Sara knew nothing about the fact, but from that time the Large Family
was as profoundly interested in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) was in it. Faces used to
appear at the nursery windows when she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) passed, and many discussions
concerning her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) were held round the fire.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) is a kind of servant at the seminary,''  (<font color='red'><b>Janet</b></font>)</div>Janet said. <div class="bookquote">``I don't
believe she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) belongs to anybody. I believe she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) is an orphan. But she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) is
not a beggar, however shabby she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) looks.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>And afterward she (<font color='blue'><b>Janet</b></font>) was called by all of them,
<div class="bookquote">``The-little-girl-who-is-not-a-beggar,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>which was, of course, rather a
long name, and sounded very funny sometimes when the youngest ones said
it in a hurry.

<p/>Sara managed to bore a hole in the sixpence and hung it on an old bit
of narrow ribbon round her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) neck. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) affection for the Large Family
increased--as, indeed, her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) affection for everything she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) could love
increased. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) grew fonder and fonder of Becky, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) used to look
forward to the two mornings a week when she (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) went into the schoolroom to
give the little ones their French lesson. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) small pupils loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>),
and strove with each other for the privilege of standing close to her (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>)
and insinuating their small hands into hers. It fed her (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) hungry heart to
feel them nestling up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) made such friends with the sparrows
that when she (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) stood upon the table, put her (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) head and shoulders out of
the attic window, and chirped, she (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) heard almost immediately a flutter
of wings and answering twitters, and a little flock of dingy town birds
appeared and alighted on the slates to talk to her (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) and make much of the
crumbs she (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) scattered. With Melchisedec she (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) had become so intimate that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) actually brought Mrs. Melchisedec with him (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) sometimes, and now and
then one or two of his (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) children. She (<font color='blue'><b>Melchisedec</b></font>) used to talk to him (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>), and,
somehow, he (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) looked quite as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) understood.

<p/>There had grown in her (<font color='blue'><b>Melchisedec</b></font>) mind rather a strange feeling about Emily, who
always sat and looked on at everything. It arose in one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Melchisedec</b></font>) moments
of great desolateness. She (<font color='blue'><b>Melchisedec</b></font>) would have liked to believe or pretend to
believe that Emily understood and sympathized with her (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>) did not
like to own to herself that her (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>) only companion could feel and hear
nothing. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>) used to put her (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>) in a chair sometimes and sit opposite to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>) on the old red footstool, and stare and pretend about her (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>) until her (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>)
own eyes would grow large with something which was almost like
fear--particularly at night when everything was so still, when the only
sound in the attic was the occasional sudden scurry and squeak of
Melchisedec's family in the wall. One of her (<font color='blue'><b>Melchisedec</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``pretends''  (<font color='red'><b>Emily</b></font>)</div>was that Emily
was a kind of good witch who could protect her (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>). Sometimes, after she (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>)
had stared at her (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>) until she (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>) was wrought up to the highest pitch of
fancifulness, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>) would ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>) questions and find herself ALMOST
feeling as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>) would presently answer. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>) never did.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``As to answering, though,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>said Sara, trying to console herself, <div class="bookquote">``I
don't answer very often. I never answer when I can help it. When
people are insulting you, there is nothing so good for them as not to
say a word--just to look at them and THINK. Miss Minchin turns pale
with rage when I do it, Miss Amelia looks frightened, and so do the
girls. When you will not fly into a passion people know you are
stronger than they are, because you are strong enough to hold in your
rage, and they are not, and they say stupid things they wish they
hadn't said afterward. There's nothing so strong as rage, except what
makes you hold it in--that's stronger. It's a good thing not to answer
your enemies. I scarcely ever do. Perhaps Emily is more like me than I
am like myself. Perhaps she (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>) would rather not answer her (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>) friends, even.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>) keeps it all in her (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>) heart.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div><p/>But though she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) tried to satisfy herself with these arguments, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) did
not find it easy. When, after a long, hard day, in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) had been
sent here and there, sometimes on long errands through wind and cold
and rain, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) came in wet and hungry, and was sent out again because
nobody chose to remember that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) was only a child, and that her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) slim
legs might be tired and her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) small body might be chilled; when she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) had
been given only harsh words and cold, slighting looks for thanks; when
the cook had been vulgar and insolent; when Miss Minchin had been in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) worst mood, and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) had seen the girls sneering among
themselves at her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) shabbiness--then she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) was not always able to comfort
her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) sore, proud, desolate heart with fancies when Emily merely sat
upright in her (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>) old chair and stared.

<p/>One of these nights, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>) came up to the attic cold and hungry,
with a tempest raging in her (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>) young breast, Emily's stare seemed so
vacant, her (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>) sawdust legs and arms so inexpressive, that Sara lost all
control over herself. There was nobody but Emily--no one in the world.
And there she (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>) sat.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall die presently,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>) said at first.

<p/>Emily simply stared.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't bear this,''  (<font color='red'><b>the child</b></font>)</div>said the poor child, trembling. <div class="bookquote">``I know I shall
die. I'm cold; I'm wet; I'm starving to death. I've walked a thousand
miles today, and they have done nothing but scold me from morning until
night. And because I could not find that last thing the cook sent me
for, they would not give me any supper. Some men laughed at me because
my old shoes made me slip down in the mud. I'm covered with mud now.
And they laughed. Do you hear?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>) looked at the staring glass eyes and complacent face, and suddenly
a sort of heartbroken rage seized her (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>) lifted her (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>) little savage
hand and knocked Emily off the chair, bursting into a passion of
sobbing--Sara who never cried.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are nothing but a DOLL!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) cried. <div class="bookquote">``Nothing but a
doll--doll--doll! You care for nothing. You are stuffed with sawdust.
You never had a heart. Nothing could ever make you feel. You are a
DOLL!''  (<font color='red'><b>Emily</b></font>)</div>Emily lay on the floor, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>) legs ignominiously doubled up
over her (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>) head, and a new flat place on the end of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>) nose; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>) was
calm, even dignified. Sara hid her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) face in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) arms. The rats in the
wall began to fight and bite each other and squeak and scramble.
Melchisedec was chastising some of his (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>) family.

<p/>Sara's sobs gradually quieted themselves. It was so unlike her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) to
break down that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) was surprised at herself. After a while she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) raised
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) face and looked at Emily, who seemed to be gazing at her (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>) round the
side of one angle, and, somehow, by this time actually with a kind of
glassy-eyed sympathy. Sara bent and picked her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) up. Remorse overtook
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) even smiled at herself a very little smile.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You can't help being a doll,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) said with a resigned sigh, <div class="bookquote">``any more
than Lavinia and Jessie can help not having any sense. We are not all
made alike. Perhaps you do your sawdust best.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) and
shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) clothes straight, and put her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) back upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) chair.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) had wished very much that some one would take the empty house next
door. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) wished it because of the attic window which was so near
hers. It seemed as if it would be so nice to see it propped open
someday and a head and shoulders rising out of the square aperture.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If it looked a nice head,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) thought, ``I might begin by saying,
``Good morning,<div class="bookquote">'' and all sorts of things might happen. But, of course,
it's not really likely that anyone but under servants would sleep
there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>One morning, on turning the corner of the square after a visit to the
grocer's, the butcher's, and the baker's, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) saw, to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) great
delight, that during her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) rather prolonged absence, a van full of
furniture had stopped before the next house, the front doors were
thrown open, and men in shirt sleeves were going in and out carrying
heavy packages and pieces of furniture.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's taken!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``It really IS taken! Oh, I do hope a nice
head will look out of the attic window!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) would almost have liked to join the group of loiterers who had
stopped on the pavement to watch the things carried in. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) had an idea
that if she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) could see some of the furniture she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) could guess something
about the people it belonged to.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Minchin's tables and chairs are just like her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) thought; <div class="bookquote">``I
remember thinking that the first minute I saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>), even though I was so
little. I told papa afterward, and he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) laughed and said it was true. I
am sure the Large Family have fat, comfortable armchairs and sofas, and
I can see that their red-flowery wallpaper is exactly like them. It's
warm and cheerful and kind-looking and happy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) was sent out for parsley to the greengrocer's later in the day, and
when she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) came up the area steps her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) heart gave quite a quick beat of
recognition. Several pieces of furniture had been set out of the van
upon the pavement. There was a beautiful table of elaborately wrought
teakwood, and some chairs, and a screen covered with rich Oriental
embroidery. The sight of them gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) a weird, homesick feeling. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>)
had seen things so like them in India. One of the things Miss Minchin
had taken from her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) was a carved teakwood desk her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) father had sent her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They are beautiful things,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``they look as if they ought to
belong to a nice person. All the things look rather grand. I suppose
it is a rich family.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>The vans of furniture came and were unloaded and gave place to others
all the day. Several times it so happened that Sara had an opportunity
of seeing things carried in. It became plain that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) had been right
in guessing that the newcomers were people of large means. All the
furniture was rich and beautiful, and a great deal of it was Oriental.
Wonderful rugs and draperies and ornaments were taken from the vans,
many pictures, and books enough for a library. Among other things there
was a superb god Buddha in a splendid shrine.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Someone in the family MUST have been in India,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>Sara thought. <div class="bookquote">``They
have got used to Indian things and like them. I AM glad. I shall feel
as if they were friends, even if a head never looks out of the attic
window.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) was taking in the evening's milk for the cook -LRB-there was
really no odd job she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) was not called upon to do-RRB-, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) saw something
occur which made the situation more interesting than ever. The
handsome, rosy man who was the father of the Large Family walked across
the square in the most matter-of-fact manner, and ran up the steps of
the next-door house. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) ran up them as if he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) felt quite at home and
expected to run up and down them many a time in the future. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) stayed
inside quite a long time, and several times came out and gave
directions to the workmen, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had a right to do so. It was quite
certain that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was in some intimate way connected with the newcomers
and was acting for them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If the new people have children,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>Sara speculated, <div class="bookquote">``the Large Family
children will be sure to come and play with them, and they MIGHT come
up into the attic just for fun.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div><p/>At night, after her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) work was done, Becky came in to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) fellow
prisoner and bring her (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) news.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's a' Nindian gentleman that's comin' to live next door, miss,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>)
said. <div class="bookquote">``I don't know whether he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)'s a black gentleman or not, but he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)'s a
Nindian one. He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)'s very rich, an' he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)'s ill, an' the gentleman of the
Large Family is his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) lawyer. He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)'s had a lot of trouble, an' it's made
him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) ill an' low in his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) mind. He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) worships idols, miss. He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)'s an `eathen
an' bows down to wood an' stone. I seen a' idol bein' carried in for
him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) to worship. Somebody had oughter send him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) a trac'. You can get a

 (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div><p/>Sara laughed a little.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't believe he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) worships that idol,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``some people like to
keep them to look at because they are interesting. My papa had a
beautiful one, and he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) did not worship it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>But Becky was rather inclined to prefer to believe that the new
neighbor was <div class="bookquote">``an `eathen.''  (<font color='red'><b>the neighbor</b></font>)</div>It sounded so much more romantic than that
he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) should merely be the ordinary kind of gentleman who went to church
with a prayer book. She (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) sat and talked long that night of what he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>)
would be like, of what his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) wife would be like if he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) had one, and of
what his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) children would be like if they had children. Sara saw that
privately she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) could not help hoping very much that they would all be
black, and would wear turbans, and, above all, that--like their
parent--they would all be <div class="bookquote">''`eathens.''

 (<font color='red'><b>parent</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I never lived next door to no `eathens, miss,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``I should
like to see what sort o' ways they'd have.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>It was several weeks before her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) curiosity was satisfied, and then it
was revealed that the new occupant had neither wife nor children. He (<font color='blue'><b>occupant</b></font>)
was a solitary man with no family at all, and it was evident that he (<font color='blue'><b>occupant</b></font>)
was shattered in health and unhappy in mind.

<p/>A carriage drove up one day and stopped before the house. When the
footman dismounted from the box and opened the door the gentleman who
was the father of the Large Family got out first. After him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) there
descended a nurse in uniform, then came down the steps two
men-servants. They came to assist their master, who, when he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) was helped
out of the carriage, proved to be a man with a haggard, distressed
face, and a skeleton body wrapped in furs. He (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) was carried up the
steps, and the head of the Large Family went with him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>), looking very
anxious. Shortly afterward a doctor's carriage arrived, and the doctor
went in--plainly to take care of him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There is such a yellow gentleman next door, Sara,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lottie/Lottie Legh</b></font>)</div>Lottie whispered at
the French class afterward. <div class="bookquote">``Do you think he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) is a Chinee? The

with your exercise, Lottie. <div class="bookquote">``Non, monsieur. Je n'ai pas le canif de

 (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div><p/>That was the beginning of the story of the Indian gentleman.



<p/>11

<p/>Ram Dass


<p/>There were fine sunsets even in the square, sometimes. One could only
see parts of them, however, between the chimneys and over the roofs.
From the kitchen windows one could not see them at all, and could only
guess that they were going on because the bricks looked warm and the
air rosy or yellow for a while, or perhaps one saw a blazing glow
strike a particular pane of glass somewhere. There was, however, one
place from which one could see all the splendor of them: the piles of
red or gold clouds in the west; or the purple ones edged with dazzling
brightness; or the little fleecy, floating ones, tinged with rose-color
and looking like flights of pink doves scurrying across the blue in a
great hurry if there was a wind. The place where one could see all
this, and seem at the same time to breathe a purer air, was, of course,
the attic window. When the square suddenly seemed to begin to glow in
an enchanted way and look wonderful in spite of its sooty trees and
railings, Sara knew something was going on in the sky; and when it was
at all possible to leave the kitchen without being missed or called
back, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) invariably stole away and crept up the flights of stairs,
and, climbing on the old table, got her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) head and body as far out of the
window as possible. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) had accomplished this, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) always drew a
long breath and looked all round her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>). It used to seem as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) had
all the sky and the world to herself. No one else ever looked out of
the other attics. Generally the skylights were closed; but even if
they were propped open to admit air, no one seemed to come near them.
And there Sara would stand, sometimes turning her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) face upward to the
blue which seemed so friendly and near--just like a lovely vaulted
ceiling--sometimes watching the west and all the wonderful things that
happened there: the clouds melting or drifting or waiting softly to be
changed pink or crimson or snow-white or purple or pale dove-gray.
Sometimes they made islands or great mountains enclosing lakes of deep
turquoise-blue, or liquid amber, or chrysoprase-green; sometimes dark
headlands jutted into strange, lost seas; sometimes slender strips of
wonderful lands joined other wonderful lands together. There were
places where it seemed that one could run or climb or stand and wait to
see what next was coming--until, perhaps, as it all melted, one could
float away. At least it seemed so to Sara, and nothing had ever been
quite so beautiful to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) as the things she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) saw as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) stood on the
table--her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) body half out of the skylight--the sparrows twittering with
sunset softness on the slates. The sparrows always seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) to
twitter with a sort of subdued softness just when these marvels were
going on.

<p/>There was such a sunset as this a few days after the Indian gentleman
was brought to his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) new home; and, as it fortunately happened that the
afternoon's work was done in the kitchen and nobody had ordered her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) to
go anywhere or perform any task, Sara found it easier than usual to
slip away and go upstairs.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) mounted her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) table and stood looking out. It was a wonderful
moment. There were floods of molten gold covering the west, as if a
glorious tide was sweeping over the world. A deep, rich yellow light
filled the air; the birds flying across the tops of the houses showed
quite black against it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's a Splendid one,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>said Sara, softly, to herself. <div class="bookquote">``It makes me
feel almost afraid--as if something strange was just going to happen.
The Splendid ones always make me feel like that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) suddenly turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) head because she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) heard a sound a few yards away
from her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>). It was an odd sound like a queer little squeaky chattering.
It came from the window of the next attic. Someone had come to look at
the sunset as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) had. There was a head and a part of a body emerging
from the skylight, but it was not the head or body of a little girl or
a housemaid; it was the picturesque white-swathed form and dark-faced,
gleaming-eyed, white-turbaned head of a native Indian man-servant--<div class="bookquote">``a
Lascar,''  (<font color='red'><b>a man-servant</b></font>)</div>Sara said to herself quickly--and the sound she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) had heard came
from a small monkey he (<font color='blue'><b>monkey</b></font>) held in his (<font color='blue'><b>monkey</b></font>) arms as if he (<font color='blue'><b>monkey</b></font>) were fond of it, and
which was snuggling and chattering against his (<font color='blue'><b>monkey</b></font>) breast.

<p/>As Sara looked toward him (<font color='blue'><b>monkey</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>monkey</b></font>) looked toward her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>). The first thing she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>)
thought was that his (<font color='blue'><b>monkey</b></font>) dark face looked sorrowful and homesick. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) felt
absolutely sure he (<font color='blue'><b>monkey</b></font>) had come up to look at the sun, because he (<font color='blue'><b>monkey</b></font>) had seen
it so seldom in England that he (<font color='blue'><b>monkey</b></font>) longed for a sight of it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) looked at
him (<font color='blue'><b>monkey</b></font>) interestedly for a second, and then smiled across the slates. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>)
had learned to know how comforting a smile, even from a stranger, may
be.

<p/>Hers was evidently a pleasure to him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>). His (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) whole expression altered,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) showed such gleaming white teeth as he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) smiled back that it was
as if a light had been illuminated in his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) dusky face. The friendly look
in Sara's eyes was always very effective when people felt tired or dull.

<p/>It was perhaps in making his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) salute to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) loosened his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) hold on
the monkey. He (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) was an impish monkey and always ready for adventure,
and it is probable that the sight of a little girl excited him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>)
suddenly broke loose, jumped on to the slates, ran across them
chattering, and actually leaped on to Sara's shoulder, and from there
down into her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) attic room. It made her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) laugh and delighted her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>); but she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>)
knew he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) must be restored to his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) master--if the Lascar was his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>)
master--and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) wondered how this was to be done. Would he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) let her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>)
catch him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>), or would he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) be naughty and refuse to be caught, and perhaps
get away and run off over the roofs and be lost? That would not do at
all. Perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) belonged to the Indian gentleman, and the poor man was
fond of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) turned to the Lascar, feeling glad that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) remembered still some
of the Hindustani she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) had learned when she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) lived with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) father. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>)
could make the man understand. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) spoke to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in the language he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
knew.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Will he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) let me catch him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) asked.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) had never seen more surprise and delight than the dark
face expressed when she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) spoke in the familiar tongue. The truth was
that the poor fellow felt as if his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) gods had intervened, and the kind
little voice came from heaven itself. At once Sara saw that he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) had
been accustomed to European children. He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) poured forth a flood of
respectful thanks. He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) was the servant of Missee Sahib. The monkey was
a good monkey and would not bite; but, unfortunately, he (<font color='blue'><b>monkey</b></font>) was difficult
to catch. He (<font color='blue'><b>monkey</b></font>) would flee from one spot to another, like the lightning.
He (<font color='blue'><b>monkey</b></font>) was disobedient, though not evil. Ram Dass knew him (<font color='blue'><b>Dass</b></font>) as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Dass</b></font>) were
his (<font color='blue'><b>Dass</b></font>) child, and Ram Dass he (<font color='blue'><b>Dass</b></font>) would sometimes obey, but not always. If
Missee Sahib would permit Ram Dass, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dass</b></font>) himself could cross the roof to
her (<font color='blue'><b>himself</b></font>) room, enter the windows, and regain the unworthy little animal.
But he (<font color='blue'><b>Dass</b></font>) was evidently afraid Sara might think he (<font color='blue'><b>Dass</b></font>) was taking a great
liberty and perhaps would not let him (<font color='blue'><b>Dass</b></font>) come.

<p/>But Sara gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Dass</b></font>) leave at once.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Can you get across?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) inquired.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``In a moment,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Dass</b></font>) answered her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then come,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) is flying from side to side of the room as
if he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was frightened.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Ram Dass slipped through his (<font color='blue'><b>Dass</b></font>) attic window and crossed to hers as
steadily and lightly as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Dass</b></font>) had walked on roofs all his (<font color='blue'><b>Dass</b></font>) life. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dass</b></font>)
slipped through the skylight and dropped upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Dass</b></font>) feet without a sound.
Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Dass</b></font>) turned to Sara and salaamed again. The monkey saw him (<font color='blue'><b>monkey</b></font>) and
uttered a little scream. Ram Dass hastily took the precaution of
shutting the skylight, and then went in chase of him (<font color='blue'><b>Dass</b></font>). It was not a very
long chase. The monkey prolonged it a few minutes evidently for the
mere fun of it, but presently he (<font color='blue'><b>monkey</b></font>) sprang chattering on to Ram Dass's
shoulder and sat there chattering and clinging to his (<font color='blue'><b>Dass</b></font>) neck with a weird
little skinny arm.

<p/>Ram Dass thanked Sara profoundly. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) had seen that his (<font color='blue'><b>Dass</b></font>) quick native
eyes had taken in at a glance all the bare shabbiness of the room, but
he (<font color='blue'><b>Dass</b></font>) spoke to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Dass</b></font>) were speaking to the little daughter of a
rajah, and pretended that he (<font color='blue'><b>Dass</b></font>) observed nothing. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dass</b></font>) did not presume to
remain more than a few moments after he (<font color='blue'><b>Dass</b></font>) had caught the monkey, and
those moments were given to further deep and grateful obeisance to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>)
in return for her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) indulgence. This little evil one, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dass</b></font>) said, stroking
the monkey, was, in truth, not so evil as he (<font color='blue'><b>Dass</b></font>) seemed, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Dass</b></font>) master,
who was ill, was sometimes amused by him (<font color='blue'><b>Dass</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Dass</b></font>) would have been made sad
if his (<font color='blue'><b>Dass</b></font>) favorite had run away and been lost. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Dass</b></font>) salaamed once more
and got through the skylight and across the slates again with as much
agility as the monkey himself had displayed.

<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>monkey</b></font>) had gone Sara stood in the middle of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) attic and thought of
many things his (<font color='blue'><b>monkey</b></font>) face and his (<font color='blue'><b>monkey</b></font>) manner had brought back to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>). The sight
of his (<font color='blue'><b>monkey</b></font>) native costume and the profound reverence of his (<font color='blue'><b>monkey</b></font>) manner stirred
all her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) past memories. It seemed a strange thing to remember that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>)--the drudge whom the cook had said insulting things to an hour
ago--had only a few years ago been surrounded by people who all treated
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) as Ram Dass had treated her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>); who salaamed when she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) went by, whose
foreheads almost touched the ground when she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) spoke to them, who were
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) servants and her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) slaves. It was like a sort of dream. It was all
over, and it could never come back. It certainly seemed that there was
no way in which any change could take place. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) knew what Miss Minchin
intended that her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) future should be. So long as she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) was too young to be
used as a regular teacher, she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) would be used as an errand girl and
servant and yet expected to remember what she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) had learned and in some
mysterious way to learn more. The greater number of her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) evenings she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>)
was supposed to spend at study, and at various indefinite intervals she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>)
was examined and knew she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) would have been severely admonished if she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>)
had not advanced as was expected of her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>). The truth, indeed, was that
Miss Minchin knew that she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) was too anxious to learn to require
teachers. Give her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) books, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) would devour them and end by knowing
them by heart. She (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) might be trusted to be equal to teaching a good
deal in the course of a few years. This was what would happen: when
she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) was older she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) would be expected to drudge in the schoolroom as she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>)
drudged now in various parts of the house; they would be obliged to
give her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) more respectable clothes, but they would be sure to be plain
and ugly and to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) look somehow like a servant. That was all
there seemed to be to look forward to, and Sara stood quite still for
several minutes and thought it over.

<p/>Then a thought came back to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) which made the color rise in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) cheek
and a spark light itself in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) eyes. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) straightened her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) thin little
body and lifted her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) head.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Whatever comes,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``cannot alter one thing. If I am a
princess in rags and tatters, I can be a princess inside. It would be
easy to be a princess if I were dressed in cloth of gold, but it is a
great deal more of a triumph to be one all the time when no one knows
it. There was Marie Antoinette when she (<font color='blue'><b>Antoinette</b></font>) was in prison and her (<font color='blue'><b>Antoinette</b></font>) throne
was gone and she (<font color='blue'><b>Antoinette</b></font>) had only a black gown on, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Antoinette</b></font>) hair was white, and
they insulted her (<font color='blue'><b>Antoinette</b></font>) and called her (<font color='blue'><b>Antoinette</b></font>) Widow Capet. She (<font color='blue'><b>Antoinette</b></font>) was a great deal more
like a queen then than when she (<font color='blue'><b>Antoinette</b></font>) was so gay and everything was so grand.
I like her (<font color='blue'><b>Antoinette</b></font>) best then. Those howling mobs of people did not frighten
her (<font color='blue'><b>Antoinette</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Antoinette</b></font>) was stronger than they were, even when they cut her (<font color='blue'><b>Antoinette</b></font>) head off.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>This was not a new thought, but quite an old one, by this time. It had
consoled her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) through many a bitter day, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) had gone about the
house with an expression in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) face which Miss Minchin could not
understand and which was a source of great annoyance to her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>), as it
seemed as if the child were mentally living a life which held her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) above
the rest of the world. It was as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) scarcely heard the rude and
acid things said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>); or, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) heard them, did not care for them
at all. Sometimes, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) was in the midst of some harsh,
domineering speech, Miss Minchin would find the still, unchildish eyes
fixed upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) with something like a proud smile in them. At such
times she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) did not know that Sara was saying to herself:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't know that you are saying these things to a princess, and
that if I chose I could wave my hand and order you to execution. I only
spare you because I am a princess, and you are a poor, stupid, unkind,
vulgar old thing, and don't know any better.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div><p/>This used to interest and amuse her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) more than anything else; and queer
and fanciful as it was, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) found comfort in it and it was a good thing
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>). While the thought held possession of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) could not be
made rude and malicious by the rudeness and malice of those about her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A princess must be polite,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) said to herself.

<p/>And so when the servants, taking their tone from their mistress, were
insolent and ordered her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) about, she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) would hold her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) head erect and reply
to them with a quaint civility which often made them stare at her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>)'s got more airs and graces than if she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) come from Buckingham
Palace, that young one,''  (<font color='red'><b>the cook</b></font>)</div>said the cook, chuckling a little sometimes.
``I lose my temper with her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) often enough, but I will say she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) never
forgets her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) manners. ``If you please, cook'; <div class="bookquote">``Will you be so kind,
cook?''  (<font color='red'><b>cook</b></font>)</div>``I beg your pardon, cook'; ``May I trouble you, cook?<div class="bookquote">'' She (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>)
drops 'em about the kitchen as if they was nothing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>The morning after the interview with Ram Dass and his (<font color='blue'><b>Dass</b></font>) monkey, Sara was
in the schoolroom with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) small pupils. Having finished giving them
their lessons, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) was putting the French exercise-books together and
thinking, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) did it, of the various things royal personages in
disguise were called upon to do: Alfred the Great, for instance,
burning the cakes and getting his (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) ears boxed by the wife of the
neat-herd. How frightened she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) must have been when she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) found out what
she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had done. If Miss Minchin should find out that she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>)--Sara, whose
toes were almost sticking out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) boots--was a princess--a real one!
The look in her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) eyes was exactly the look which Miss Minchin most
disliked. She (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) would not have it; she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) was quite near her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) and was so
enraged that she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) actually flew at her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) and boxed her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) ears--exactly as
the neat-herd's wife had boxed King Alfred's. It made Sara start. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>)
wakened from her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) dream at the shock, and, catching her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) breath, stood
still a second. Then, not knowing she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) was going to do it, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) broke
into a little laugh.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What are you laughing at, you bold, impudent child?''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Minchin/MISS MINCHIN</b></font>)</div>Miss Minchin
exclaimed.

<p/>It took Sara a few seconds to control herself sufficiently to remember
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) was a princess. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) cheeks were red and smarting from the
blows she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) had received.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I was thinking,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) answered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Beg my pardon immediately,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Minchin/MISS MINCHIN</b></font>)</div>said Miss Minchin.

<p/>Sara hesitated a second before she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) replied.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I will beg your pardon for laughing, if it was rude,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) said then;
<div class="bookquote">``but I won't beg your pardon for thinking.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What were you thinking?''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Minchin/MISS MINCHIN</b></font>)</div>demanded Miss Minchin.
<div class="bookquote">``How dare you think? What were you thinking?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jessie</b></font>)</div><p/>Jessie tittered, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Jessie</b></font>) and Lavinia nudged each other in unison. All
the girls looked up from their books to listen. Really, it always
interested them a little when Miss Minchin attacked Sara. Sara always
said something queer, and never seemed the least bit frightened. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>)
was not in the least frightened now, though her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) boxed ears were scarlet
and her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) eyes were as bright as stars.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I was thinking,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) answered grandly and politely, <div class="bookquote">``that you did not
know what you were doing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That I did not know what I was doing?''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Minchin/MISS MINCHIN</b></font>)</div>Miss Minchin fairly gasped.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>said Sara, <div class="bookquote">``and I was thinking what would happen if I were a
princess and you boxed my ears--what I should do to you. And I was
thinking that if I were one, you would never dare to do it, whatever I
said or did. And I was thinking how surprised and frightened you would
be if you suddenly found out--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) had the imagined future so clearly before her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) eyes that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) spoke
in a manner which had an effect even upon Miss Minchin. It almost
seemed for the moment to her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) narrow, unimaginative mind that there must
be some real power hidden behind this candid daring.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) exclaimed. <div class="bookquote">``Found out what?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That I really was a princess,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>said Sara, <div class="bookquote">``and could do
anything--anything I liked.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div><p/>Every pair of eyes in the room widened to its full limit. Lavinia
leaned forward on her (<font color='blue'><b>Lavinia</b></font>) seat to look.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Go to your room,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Minchin/MISS MINCHIN</b></font>)</div>cried Miss Minchin, breathlessly, <div class="bookquote">``this instant!
Leave the schoolroom! Attend to your lessons, young ladies!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Minchin/MISS MINCHIN</b></font>)</div><p/>Sara made a little bow.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Excuse me for laughing if it was impolite,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) said, and walked out
of the room, leaving Miss Minchin struggling with her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) rage, and the
girls whispering over their books.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Did you see her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>)? Did you see how queer she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) looked?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jessie</b></font>)</div>Jessie broke
out. <div class="bookquote">``I shouldn't be at all surprised if she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) did turn out to be
something. Suppose she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) should!''

<p/>The Other Side of the Wall


<p/>When one lives in a row of houses, it is interesting to think of the
things which are being done and said on the other side of the wall of
the very rooms one is living in. Sara was fond of amusing herself by
trying to imagine the things hidden by the wall which divided the
Select Seminary from the Indian gentleman's house. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) knew that the
schoolroom was next to the Indian gentleman's study, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) hoped that
the wall was thick so that the noise made sometimes after lesson hours
would not disturb him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am growing quite fond of him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) said to Ermengarde; <div class="bookquote">``I should not
like him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) to be disturbed. I have adopted him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) for a friend. You can do
that with people you never speak to at all. You can just watch them,
and think about them and be sorry for them, until they seem almost like
relations. I'm quite anxious sometimes when I see the doctor call
twice a day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ermengarde/John/Ermengarde St. John</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have very few relations,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ermengarde/John/Ermengarde St. John</b></font>)</div>said Ermengarde, reflectively, ``and I'm
very glad of it. I don't like those I have. My two aunts are always
saying, ``Dear me, Ermengarde! You are very fat. You shouldn't eat
sweets,'' and my uncle is always asking me things like, ``When did Edward
the Third ascend the throne?'' and, <div class="bookquote">``Who died of a surfeit of lampreys?'''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div><p/>Sara laughed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``People you never speak to can't ask you questions like that,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>)
said; <div class="bookquote">``and I'm sure the Indian gentleman wouldn't even if he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was quite
intimate with you. I am fond of him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) had become fond of the Large Family because they looked happy; but
she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) had become fond of the Indian gentleman because he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) looked unhappy.
He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had evidently not fully recovered from some very severe illness. In
the kitchen--where, of course, the servants, through some mysterious
means, knew everything--there was much discussion of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) case. He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was
not an Indian gentleman really, but an Englishman who had lived in
India. He (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) had met with great misfortunes which had for a time so
imperilled his (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) whole fortune that he (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) had thought himself ruined and
disgraced forever. The shock had been so great that he (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) had almost died
of brain fever; and ever since he (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) had been shattered in health, though
his (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) fortunes had changed and all his (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) possessions had been restored to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>). His (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) trouble and peril had been connected with mines.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And mines with diamonds in 'em!''  (<font color='red'><b>the cook</b></font>)</div>said the cook. <div class="bookquote">``No savin's of mine
never goes into no mines--particular diamond ones'' (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>--with a side glance
at Sara. <div class="bookquote">``We all know somethin' of THEM.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) felt as my papa felt,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>Sara thought. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was ill as my papa was;
but he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) did not die.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>So her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) heart was more drawn to him (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>) than before. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) was sent out
at night she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) used sometimes to feel quite glad, because there was
always a chance that the curtains of the house next door might not yet
be closed and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) could look into the warm room and see her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) adopted
friend. When no one was about she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) used sometimes to stop, and, holding
to the iron railings, wish him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) good night as if he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) could hear her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps you can FEEL if you can't hear,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) fancy. <div class="bookquote">``Perhaps kind
thoughts reach people somehow, even through windows and doors and
walls. Perhaps you feel a little warm and comforted, and don't know
why, when I am standing here in the cold and hoping you will get well
and happy again. I am so sorry for you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) would whisper in an
intense little voice. ``I wish you had a ``Little Missus' who could pet
you as I used to pet papa when he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) had a headache. I should like to be
your <div class="bookquote">``Little Missus' myself, poor dear! Good night--good night. God
bless you!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) would go away, feeling quite comforted and a little warmer herself.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) sympathy was so strong that it seemed as if it MUST reach him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)
somehow as he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) sat alone in his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) armchair by the fire, nearly always in a
great dressing gown, and nearly always with his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) forehead resting in his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)
hand as he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) gazed hopelessly into the fire. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) looked to Sara like a man
who had a trouble on his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) mind still, not merely like one whose troubles
lay all in the past.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) always seems as if he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) were thinking of something that hurts him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)
NOW,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) said to herself, <div class="bookquote">``but he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) has got his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) money back and he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) will
get over his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) brain fever in time, so he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) ought not to look like that. I
wonder if there is something else.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>If there was something else--something even servants did not hear
of--she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) could not help believing that the father of the Large Family
knew it--the gentleman she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) called Mr. Montmorency. Mr. Montmorency
went to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Montmorency</b></font>) often, and Mrs. Montmorency and all the little
Montmorencys went, too, though less often. He (<font color='blue'><b>Montmorency</b></font>) seemed particularly fond
of the two elder little girls--the Janet and Nora who had been so
alarmed when their small brother Donald had given Sara his (<font color='blue'><b>Donald</b></font>) sixpence. He (<font color='blue'><b>Donald</b></font>)
had, in fact, a very tender place in his (<font color='blue'><b>Donald</b></font>) heart for all children, and
particularly for little girls. Janet and Nora were as fond of him (<font color='blue'><b>Donald</b></font>) as
he (<font color='blue'><b>Donald</b></font>) was of them, and looked forward with the greatest pleasure to the
afternoons when they were allowed to cross the square and make their
well-behaved little visits to him (<font color='blue'><b>Donald</b></font>). They were extremely decorous little
visits because he (<font color='blue'><b>Donald</b></font>) was an invalid.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) is a poor thing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Janet</b></font>)</div>said Janet, <div class="bookquote">``and he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) says we cheer him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) up. We try
to cheer him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) up very quietly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Janet</b></font>)</div><p/>Janet was the head of the family, and kept the rest of it in order. It
was she (<font color='blue'><b>Janet</b></font>) who decided when it was discreet to ask the Indian gentleman to
tell stories about India, and it was she (<font color='blue'><b>Janet</b></font>) who saw when he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was tired and
it was the time to steal quietly away and tell Ram Dass to go to him (<font color='blue'><b>Dass</b></font>).
They were very fond of Ram Dass. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dass</b></font>) could have told any number of
stories if he (<font color='blue'><b>Dass</b></font>) had been able to speak anything but Hindustani. The
Indian gentleman's real name was Mr. Carrisford, and Janet told Mr.
Carrisford about the encounter with the
little-girl-who-was-not-a-beggar. He (<font color='blue'><b>Carrisford</b></font>) was very much interested, and all
the more so when he (<font color='blue'><b>Carrisford</b></font>) heard from Ram Dass of the adventure of the monkey
on the roof. Ram Dass made for him (<font color='blue'><b>Dass</b></font>) a very clear picture of the attic
and its desolateness--of the bare floor and broken plaster, the rusty,
empty grate, and the hard, narrow bed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Carmichael,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Dass</b></font>) said to the father of the Large Family, after he (<font color='blue'><b>Dass</b></font>) had
heard this description, <div class="bookquote">``I wonder how many of the attics in this square
are like that one, and how many wretched little servant girls sleep on
such beds, while I toss on my down pillows, loaded and harassed by
wealth that is, most of it--not mine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear fellow,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Carmichael/Carmichael</b></font>)</div>Mr. Carmichael answered cheerily, <div class="bookquote">``the sooner you
cease tormenting yourself the better it will be for you. If you
possessed all the wealth of all the Indies, you could not set right all
the discomforts in the world, and if you began to refurnish all the
attics in this square, there would still remain all the attics in all
the other squares and streets to put in order. And there you are!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Carmichael/Carmichael</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Carrisford sat and bit his (<font color='blue'><b>Carrisford</b></font>) nails as he (<font color='blue'><b>Carrisford</b></font>) looked into the glowing bed
of coals in the grate.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you suppose,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Carrisford</b></font>) said slowly, after a pause--<div class="bookquote">``do you think it is
possible that the other child--the child I never cease thinking of, I
believe--could be--could POSSIBLY be reduced to any such condition as
the poor little soul next door?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Carmichael looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Carmichael</b></font>) uneasily. He (<font color='blue'><b>Carmichael</b></font>) knew that the worst thing
the man could do for himself, for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) reason and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) health, was to
begin to think in the particular way of this particular subject.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If the child at Madame Pascal's school in Paris was the one you are in
search of,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) answered soothingly, <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) would seem to be in the hands
of people who can afford to take care of her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>). They adopted her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) because
she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) had been the favorite companion of their little daughter who died.
They had no other children, and Madame Pascal said that they were
extremely well-to-do Russians.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And the wretched woman actually did not know where they had taken
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Carrisford/Carrisford</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Mr. Carrisford.

<p/>Mr. Carmichael shrugged his (<font color='blue'><b>Carmichael</b></font>) shoulders.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was a shrewd, worldly Frenchwoman, and was evidently only too glad
to get the child so comfortably off her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hands when the father's death
left her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) totally unprovided for. Women of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) type do not trouble
themselves about the futures of children who might prove burdens. The
adopted parents apparently disappeared and left no trace.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the child</b></font>)</div><p/>``But you say ``IF the child was the one I am in search of. You say <div class="bookquote">``if.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>We are not sure. There was a difference in the name.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Madame Pascal pronounced it as if it were Carew instead of Crewe--but
that might be merely a matter of pronunciation. The circumstances were
curiously similar. An English officer in India had placed his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>)
motherless little girl at the school. He (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) had died suddenly after
losing his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) fortune.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Carmichael/Carmichael</b></font>)</div>Mr. Carmichael paused a moment, as if a new
thought had occurred to him (<font color='blue'><b>Carmichael</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Are you SURE the child was left at a
school in Paris? Are you sure it was Paris?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear fellow,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Carrisford/Carrisford</b></font>)</div>broke forth Carrisford, with restless bitterness, <div class="bookquote">``I
am SURE of nothing. I never saw either the child or her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) mother. Ralph
Crewe and I loved each other as boys, but we had not met since our
school days, until we met in India. I was absorbed in the magnificent
promise of the mines. He (<font color='blue'><b>Crewe</b></font>) became absorbed, too. The whole thing was so
huge and glittering that we half lost our heads. When we met we
scarcely spoke of anything else. I only knew that the child had been
sent to school somewhere. I do not even remember, now, HOW I knew it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Carrisford/Carrisford</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Carrisford</b></font>) was beginning to be excited. He (<font color='blue'><b>Carrisford</b></font>) always became excited when his (<font color='blue'><b>Carrisford</b></font>)
still weakened brain was stirred by memories of the catastrophes of the
past.

<p/>Mr. Carmichael watched him (<font color='blue'><b>Carmichael</b></font>) anxiously. It was necessary to ask some
questions, but they must be put quietly and with caution.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But you had reason to think the school WAS in Paris?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was the answer, <div class="bookquote">``because her (<font color='blue'><b>our</b></font>) mother was a Frenchwoman, and I had
heard that she (<font color='blue'><b>our</b></font>) wished her (<font color='blue'><b>our</b></font>) child to be educated in Paris. It seemed
only likely that she (<font color='blue'><b>our</b></font>) would be there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Carmichael/Carmichael</b></font>)</div>Mr. Carmichael said, <div class="bookquote">``it seems more than probable.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Carmichael/Carmichael</b></font>)</div><p/>The Indian gentleman leaned forward and struck the table with a long,
wasted hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Carmichael,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Carmichael</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I MUST find her (<font color='blue'><b>our</b></font>).

somewhere. If she (<font color='blue'><b>our</b></font>) is friendless and penniless, it is through my fault.
How is a man to get back his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) nerve with a thing like that on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mind?
This sudden change of luck at the mines has made realities of all our
most fantastic dreams, and poor Crewe's child may be begging in the
street!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Carmichael/Carmichael</b></font>)</div>said Carmichael. <div class="bookquote">``Try to be calm. Console yourself with the

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why was I not man enough to stand my ground when things looked black?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Carrisford/Carrisford</b></font>)</div>Carrisford groaned in petulant misery. <div class="bookquote">``I believe I should have stood
my ground if I had not been responsible for other people's money as

him (<font color='blue'><b>people</b></font>)--I--Tom Carrisford, who played cricket at Eton with him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>). What a
villain he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) must have thought me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't reproach yourself so bitterly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't reproach myself because the speculation threatened to fail--I

 (<font color='red'><b>The father</b></font>)</div><p/>The good-hearted father of the Large Family put his (<font color='blue'><b>Carmichael</b></font>) hand on his (<font color='blue'><b>Carmichael</b></font>)
shoulder comfortingly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You ran away because your brain had given way under the strain of

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Carrisford/Carrisford</b></font>)</div><p/>Carrisford dropped his (<font color='blue'><b>Carrisford</b></font>) forehead in his (<font color='blue'><b>Carrisford</b></font>) hands.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good God! Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Carrisford</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I was driven mad with dread and horror. I

He (<font color='blue'><b>Pascal</b></font>) looks as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Pascal</b></font>) were asking me a question. Sometimes I dream of him (<font color='blue'><b>Pascal</b></font>)
at night, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Pascal</b></font>) always stands before me and asks the same question in
words. Can you guess what he (<font color='blue'><b>Pascal</b></font>) says, Carmichael?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Carrisford/Carrisford</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Carmichael answered him (<font color='blue'><b>Carmichael</b></font>) in a rather low voice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not exactly,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Carmichael</b></font>) said.

<p/>``He (<font color='blue'><b>Pascal</b></font>) always says, ``Tom, old man--Tom--where is the Little Missus?''' He (<font color='blue'><b>Carmichael</b></font>)
caught at Carmichael's hand and clung to it. ``I must be able to answer
him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)--I must!'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Carmichael</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Help me to find her (<font color='blue'><b>Missus</b></font>). Help me.''


 (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div><p/>On the other side of the wall Sara was sitting in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) garret talking to
Melchisedec, who had come out for his (<font color='blue'><b>Carmichael</b></font>) evening meal.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It has been hard to be a princess today, Melchisedec,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``It
has been harder than usual. It gets harder as the weather grows colder
and the streets get more sloppy. When Lavinia laughed at my muddy
skirt as I passed her (<font color='blue'><b>Lavinia</b></font>) in the hall, I thought of something to say all in
a flash--and I only just stopped myself in time. You can't sneer back
at people like that--if you are a princess. But you have to bite your
tongue to hold yourself in. I bit mine. It was a cold afternoon,
Melchisedec. And it's a cold night.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Quite suddenly she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) put her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) black head down in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) arms, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) often
did when she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) was alone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, papa,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) whispered, ``what a long time it seems since I was your
<div class="bookquote">``Little Missus'!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>This was what happened that day on both sides of the wall.

<p/>One of the Populace


<p/>The winter was a wretched one. There were days on which Sara tramped
through snow when she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) went on her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) errands; there were worse days when
the snow melted and combined itself with mud to form slush; there were
others when the fog was so thick that the lamps in the street were
lighted all day and London looked as it had looked the afternoon,
several years ago, when the cab had driven through the thoroughfares
with Sara tucked up on its seat, leaning against her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) father's shoulder.
On such days the windows of the house of the Large Family always looked
delightfully cozy and alluring, and the study in which the Indian
gentleman sat glowed with warmth and rich color. But the attic was
dismal beyond words. There were no longer sunsets or sunrises to look
at, and scarcely ever any stars, it seemed to Sara. The clouds hung
low over the skylight and were either gray or mud-color, or dropping
heavy rain. At four o'clock in the afternoon, even when there was no
special fog, the daylight was at an end. If it was necessary to go to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) attic for anything, Sara was obliged to light a candle. The women
in the kitchen were depressed, and that made them more ill-tempered
than ever. Becky was driven like a little slave.

<p/><div class="bookquote">''`Twarn't for you, miss,''  (<font color='red'><b>a slave</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) said hoarsely to Sara one night when she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>)
had crept into the attic--<div class="bookquote">''`twarn't for you, an' the Bastille, an'
bein' the prisoner in the next cell, I should die. That there does
seem real now, doesn't it? The missus is more like the head jailer
every day she (<font color='blue'><b>missus</b></font>) lives. I can jest see them big keys you say she (<font color='blue'><b>missus</b></font>) carries.
The cook she (<font color='blue'><b>missus</b></font>)'s like one of the under-jailers. Tell me some more,
please, miss--tell me about the subt`ranean passage we've dug under the
walls.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll tell you something warmer,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>shivered Sara. <div class="bookquote">``Get your coverlet
and wrap it round you, and I'll get mine, and we will huddle close
together on the bed, and I'll tell you about the tropical forest where
the Indian gentleman's monkey used to live. When I see him (<font color='blue'><b>monkey</b></font>) sitting on
the table near the window and looking out into the street with that
mournful expression, I always feel sure he (<font color='blue'><b>monkey</b></font>) is thinking about the
tropical forest where he (<font color='blue'><b>monkey</b></font>) used to swing by his (<font color='blue'><b>monkey</b></font>) tail from coconut trees.
I wonder who caught him (<font color='blue'><b>monkey</b></font>), and if he (<font color='blue'><b>monkey</b></font>) left a family behind who had
depended on him (<font color='blue'><b>monkey</b></font>) for coconuts.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is warmer, miss,''  (<font color='red'><b>Becky</b></font>)</div>said Becky, gratefully; <div class="bookquote">``but, someways, even
the Bastille is sort of heatin' when you gets to tellin' about it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Becky</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is because it makes you think of something else,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>said Sara,
wrapping the coverlet round her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) until only her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) small dark face was to
be seen looking out of it. <div class="bookquote">``I've noticed this. What you have to do
with your mind, when your body is miserable, is to make it think of
something else.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Can you do it, miss?''  (<font color='red'><b>Becky</b></font>)</div>faltered Becky, regarding her (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) with admiring eyes.

<p/>Sara knitted her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) brows a moment.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sometimes I can and sometimes I can't,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) said stoutly. ``But when I
CAN I'm all right. And what I believe is that we always could--if we
practiced enough. I've been practicing a good deal lately, and it's
beginning to be easier than it used to be. When things are
horrible--just horrible--I think as hard as ever I can of being a
princess. I say to myself, ``I am a princess, and I am a fairy one, and
because I am a fairy nothing can hurt me or make me uncomfortable.<div class="bookquote">''
You don't know how it makes you forget'' (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>--with a laugh.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) had many opportunities of making her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) mind think of something else,
and many opportunities of proving to herself whether or not she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) was a
princess. But one of the strongest tests she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) was ever put to came on a
certain dreadful day which, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) often thought afterward, would never
quite fade out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) memory even in the years to come.

<p/>For several days it had rained continuously; the streets were chilly
and sloppy and full of dreary, cold mist; there was mud
everywhere--sticky London mud--and over everything the pall of drizzle
and fog. Of course there were several long and tiresome errands to be
done--there always were on days like this--and Sara was sent out again
and again, until her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) shabby clothes were damp through. The absurd old
feathers on her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) forlorn hat were more draggled and absurd than ever,
and her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) downtrodden shoes were so wet that they could not hold any more
water. Added to this, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) had been deprived of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) dinner, because
Miss Minchin had chosen to punish her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) was so cold and hungry and
tired that her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) face began to have a pinched look, and now and then some
kind-hearted person passing her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) in the street glanced at her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) with
sudden sympathy. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) did not know that. She (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) hurried on, trying to
make her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) mind think of something else. It was really very necessary.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) way of doing it was to <div class="bookquote">``pretend''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>and <div class="bookquote">``suppose''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>with all the
strength that was left in her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>). But really this time it was harder than
she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) had ever found it, and once or twice she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) thought it almost made her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>)
more cold and hungry instead of less so. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) persevered
obstinately, and as the muddy water squelched through her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) broken shoes
and the wind seemed trying to drag her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) thin jacket from her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) talked
to herself as she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) walked, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) did not speak aloud or even move
her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) lips.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Suppose I had dry clothes on,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) thought. <div class="bookquote">``Suppose I had good shoes
and a long, thick coat and merino stockings and a whole umbrella. And
suppose--suppose--just when I was near a baker's where they sold hot
buns, I should find sixpence--which belonged to nobody. SUPPOSE if I
did, I should go into the shop and buy six of the hottest buns and eat
them all without stopping.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Some very odd things happen in this world sometimes.

<p/>It certainly was an odd thing that happened to Sara. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) had to cross
the street just when she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) was saying this to herself. The mud was
dreadful--she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) almost had to wade. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) picked her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) way as carefully as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) could, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) could not save herself much; only, in picking her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>)
way, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) had to look down at her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) feet and the mud, and in looking
down--just as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) reached the pavement--she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) saw something shining in
the gutter. It was actually a piece of silver--a tiny piece trodden
upon by many feet, but still with spirit enough left to shine a little.
Not quite a sixpence, but the next thing to it--a fourpenny piece.

<p/>In one second it was in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) cold little red-and-blue hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) gasped, <div class="bookquote">``it is true! It is true!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>And then, if you will believe me, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) looked straight at the shop
directly facing her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>). And it was a baker's shop, and a cheerful, stout,
motherly woman with rosy cheeks was putting into the window a tray of
delicious newly baked hot buns, fresh from the oven--large, plump,
shiny buns, with currants in them.

<p/>It almost made Sara feel faint for a few seconds--the shock, and the
sight of the buns, and the delightful odors of warm bread floating up
through the baker's cellar window.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) knew she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) need not hesitate to use the little piece of money. It
had evidently been lying in the mud for some time, and its owner was
completely lost in the stream of passing people who crowded and jostled
each other all day long.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But I'll go and ask the baker woman if she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) has lost anything,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>)
said to herself, rather faintly. So she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) crossed the pavement and put
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) wet foot on the step. As she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) did so she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) saw something that made
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) stop.

<p/>It was a little figure more forlorn even than herself--a little figure
which was not much more than a bundle of rags, from which small, bare,
red muddy feet peeped out, only because the rags with which their owner
was trying to cover them were not long enough. Above the rags appeared
a shock head of tangled hair, and a dirty face with big, hollow, hungry
eyes.

<p/>Sara knew they were hungry eyes the moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) saw them, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) felt a
sudden sympathy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) said to herself, with a little sigh, <div class="bookquote">``is one of the
populace--and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is hungrier than I am.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>The child--this <div class="bookquote">``one of the populace'' (<font color='red'><b>The child</b></font>)</div>--stared up at Sara, and shuffled
herself aside a little, so as to give her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) room to pass. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) was used
to being made to give room to everybody. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) knew that if a policeman
chanced to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) would tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) to <div class="bookquote">``move on.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>Sara clutched her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) little fourpenny piece and hesitated for a few
seconds. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) spoke to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you hungry?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) asked.

<p/>The child shuffled herself and her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) rags a little more.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ain't I jist?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) said in a hoarse voice. <div class="bookquote">``Jist ain't I?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Haven't you had any dinner?''  (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>said Sara.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No dinner,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>more hoarsely still and with more shuffling. ``Nor yet no
bre`fast--nor yet no supper. No nothin'.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Since when?''  (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>asked Sara.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dunno. Never got nothin' today--nowhere. I've axed an' axed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div><p/>Just to look at her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) made Sara more hungry and faint. But those queer
little thoughts were at work in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) brain, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) was talking to
herself, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) was sick at heart.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If I'm a princess,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) was saying, <div class="bookquote">``if I'm a princess--when they were
poor and driven from their thrones--they always shared--with the
populace--if they met one poorer and hungrier than themselves. They
always shared. Buns are a penny each. If it had been sixpence I could
have eaten six. It won't be enough for either of us. But it will be
better than nothing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Wait a minute,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) said to the beggar child.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) went into the shop. It was warm and smelled deliciously. The
woman was just going to put some more hot buns into the window.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you please,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>said Sara, <div class="bookquote">``have you lost fourpence--a silver
fourpence?''  (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) held the forlorn little piece of money out to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>).

<p/>The woman looked at it and then at her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)--at her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) intense little face and
draggled, once fine clothes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Bless us, no,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) answered. <div class="bookquote">``Did you find it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>said Sara. <div class="bookquote">``In the gutter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Keep it, then,''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>said the woman. <div class="bookquote">``It may have been there for a week,
and goodness knows who lost it. YOU could never find out.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>said Sara, <div class="bookquote">``but I thought I would ask you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not many would,''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>said the woman, looking puzzled and interested and
good-natured all at once.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you want to buy something?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) added, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) saw Sara glance at
the buns.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Four buns, if you please,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>said Sara. <div class="bookquote">``Those at a penny each.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The woman</b></font>)</div><p/>The woman went to the window and put some in a paper bag.

<p/>Sara noticed that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) put in six.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I said four, if you please,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) explained. <div class="bookquote">``I have only fourpence.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll throw in two for makeweight,''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>said the woman with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
good-natured look. <div class="bookquote">``I dare say you can eat them sometime. Aren't you
hungry?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div><p/>A mist rose before Sara's eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) answered. <div class="bookquote">``I am very hungry, and I am much obliged to you
for your kindness; and'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) was going to add--<div class="bookquote">``there is a child
outside who is hungrier than I am.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>But just at that moment two or
three customers came in at once, and each one seemed in a hurry, so she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>)
could only thank the woman again and go out.

<p/>The beggar girl was still huddled up in the corner of the step. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
looked frightful in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) wet and dirty rags. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was staring straight
before her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) with a stupid look of suffering, and Sara saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) suddenly
draw the back of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) roughened black hand across her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) eyes to rub away
the tears which seemed to have surprised her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) by forcing their way from
under her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) lids. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) was muttering to herself.

<p/>Sara opened the paper bag and took out one of the hot buns, which had
already warmed her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) own cold hands a little.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``See,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) said, putting the bun in the ragged lap, <div class="bookquote">``this is nice and
hot. Eat it, and you will not feel so hungry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>The child started and stared up at her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>), as if such sudden, amazing good
luck almost frightened her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>); then she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) snatched up the bun and began to
cram it into her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) mouth with great wolfish bites.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, my! Oh, my!''  (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>Sara heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) say hoarsely, in wild delight. <div class="bookquote">``OH
my!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div><p/>Sara took out three more buns and put them down.

<p/>The sound in the hoarse, ravenous voice was awful.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) is hungrier than I am,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) said to herself. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)'s starving.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>But her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) hand trembled when she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) put down the fourth bun. <div class="bookquote">``I'm not
starving,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) said--and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) put down the fifth.

<p/>The little ravening London savage was still snatching and devouring
when she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) turned away. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) was too ravenous to give any thanks, even if
she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) had ever been taught politeness--which she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) had not. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) was only a
poor little wild animal.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good-bye,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>said Sara.

<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) reached the other side of the street she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) looked back. The
child had a bun in each hand and had stopped in the middle of a bite to
watch her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>). Sara gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) a little nod, and the child, after another
stare--a curious lingering stare--jerked her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) shaggy head in response,
and until Sara was out of sight she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) did not take another bite or even
finish the one she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) had begun.

<p/>At that moment the baker-woman looked out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) shop window.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I never!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) exclaimed. <div class="bookquote">``If that young un hasn't given her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)
buns to a beggar child! It wasn't because she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) didn't want them,
either. Well, well, she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) looked hungry enough. I'd give something to
know what she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) did it for.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) stood behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) window for a few moments and pondered. Then her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>)
curiosity got the better of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) went to the door and spoke to the
beggar child.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who gave you those buns?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>). The child nodded her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) head
toward Sara's vanishing figure.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What did she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) say?''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>inquired the woman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Axed me if I was `ungry,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>replied the hoarse voice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What did you say?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Said I was jist.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And then she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) came in and got the buns, and gave them to you, did she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>The child</b></font>)</div><p/>The child nodded.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How many?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Five.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The woman</b></font>)</div><p/>The woman thought it over.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Left just one for herself,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said in a low voice. <div class="bookquote">``And she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) could
have eaten the whole six--I saw it in her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) eyes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) looked after the little draggled far-away figure and felt more
disturbed in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) usually comfortable mind than she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had felt for many a
day.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) hadn't gone so quick,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I'm blest if she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)
shouldn't have had a dozen.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) turned to the child.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you hungry yet?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm allus hungry,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was the answer, <div class="bookquote">``but 't ain't as bad as it was.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Come in here,''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>said the woman, and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) held open the shop door.

<p/>The child got up and shuffled in. To be invited into a warm place full
of bread seemed an incredible thing. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) did not know what was going
to happen. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) did not care, even.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Get yourself warm,''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>said the woman, pointing to a fire in the tiny
back room. <div class="bookquote">``And look here; when you are hard up for a bit of bread,
you can come in here and ask for it. I'm blest if I won't give it to
you for that young one's sake.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div><p/>* * *

<p/>Sara found some comfort in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) remaining bun. At all events, it was
very hot, and it was better than nothing. As she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) walked along she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>)
broke off small pieces and ate them slowly to make them last longer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Suppose it was a magic bun,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``and a bite was as much as a
whole dinner. I should be overeating myself if I went on like this.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>It was dark when she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) reached the square where the Select Seminary was
situated. The lights in the houses were all lighted. The blinds were
not yet drawn in the windows of the room where she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) nearly always caught
glimpses of members of the Large Family. Frequently at this hour she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>)
could see the gentleman she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) called Mr. Montmorency sitting in a big
chair, with a small swarm round him (<font color='blue'><b>Montmorency</b></font>), talking, laughing, perching on the
arms of his (<font color='blue'><b>Montmorency</b></font>) seat or on his (<font color='blue'><b>Montmorency</b></font>) knees or leaning against them. This evening
the swarm was about him (<font color='blue'><b>Montmorency</b></font>), but he (<font color='blue'><b>Montmorency</b></font>) was not seated. On the contrary, there
was a good deal of excitement going on. It was evident that a journey
was to be taken, and it was Mr. Montmorency who was to take it. A
brougham stood before the door, and a big portmanteau had been strapped
upon it. The children were dancing about, chattering and hanging on to
their father. The pretty rosy mother was standing near him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), talking as
if she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was asking final questions. Sara paused a moment to see the
little ones lifted up and kissed and the bigger ones bent over and
kissed also.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wonder if he (<font color='blue'><b>yourself</b></font>) will stay away long,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) thought. <div class="bookquote">``The portmanteau is
rather big. Oh, dear, how they will miss him (<font color='blue'><b>yourself</b></font>)! I shall miss him (<font color='blue'><b>yourself</b></font>)
myself--even though he (<font color='blue'><b>yourself</b></font>) doesn't know I am alive.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>When the door opened she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) moved away--remembering the sixpence--but she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>)
saw the traveler come out and stand against the background of the
warmly-lighted hall, the older children still hovering about him (<font color='blue'><b>traveler</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Will Moscow be covered with snow?''  (<font color='red'><b>girl</b></font>)</div>said the little girl Janet. <div class="bookquote">``Will
there be ice everywhere?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Shall you drive in a drosky?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>cried another. <div class="bookquote">``Shall you see the Czar?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will write and tell you all about it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>traveler</b></font>) answered, laughing. <div class="bookquote">``And
I will send you pictures of muzhiks and things. Run into the house. It
is a hideous damp night. I would rather stay with you than go to
Moscow. Good night! Good night, duckies! God bless you!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>traveler</b></font>) ran
down the steps and jumped into the brougham.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you find the little girl, give her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) our love,''  (<font color='red'><b>Guy Clarence</b></font>)</div>shouted Guy Clarence,
jumping up and down on the door mat.

<p/>Then they went in and shut the door.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Did you see,''  (<font color='red'><b>Janet</b></font>)</div>said Janet to Nora, as they went back to the room--<div class="bookquote">``the
little-girl-who-is-not-a-beggar was passing? She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) looked all cold and
wet, and I saw her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) turn her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) head over her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) shoulder and look at us.
Mamma says her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) clothes always look as if they had been given her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) by
someone who was quite rich--someone who only let her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) have them because
they were too shabby to wear. The people at the school always send her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
out on errands on the horridest days and nights there are.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Nora</b></font>)</div><p/>Sara crossed the square to Miss Minchin's area steps, feeling faint and
shaky.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wonder who the little girl is,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) thought--<div class="bookquote">``the little girl he (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) is
going to look for.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) went down the area steps, lugging her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) basket and finding it
very heavy indeed, as the father of the Large Family drove quickly on
his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) way to the station to take the train which was to carry him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) to
Moscow, where he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was to make his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) best efforts to search for the lost
little daughter of Captain Crewe.

<p/>What Melchisedec Heard and Saw


<p/>On this very afternoon, while Sara was out, a strange thing happened in
the attic. Only Melchisedec saw and heard it; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Heard</b></font>) was so much
alarmed and mystified that he (<font color='blue'><b>Heard</b></font>) scuttled back to his (<font color='blue'><b>Heard</b></font>) hole and hid there,
and really quaked and trembled as he (<font color='blue'><b>Heard</b></font>) peeped out furtively and with
great caution to watch what was going on.

<p/>The attic had been very still all the day after Sara had left it in the
early morning. The stillness had only been broken by the pattering of
the rain upon the slates and the skylight. Melchisedec had, in fact,
found it rather dull; and when the rain ceased to patter and perfect
silence reigned, he (<font color='blue'><b>Heard</b></font>) decided to come out and reconnoiter, though
experience taught him (<font color='blue'><b>Heard</b></font>) that Sara would not return for some time. He (<font color='blue'><b>Heard</b></font>) had
been rambling and sniffing about, and had just found a totally
unexpected and unexplained crumb left from his (<font color='blue'><b>Heard</b></font>) last meal, when his (<font color='blue'><b>Heard</b></font>)
attention was attracted by a sound on the roof. He (<font color='blue'><b>Heard</b></font>) stopped to listen
with a palpitating heart. The sound suggested that something was moving
on the roof. It was approaching the skylight; it reached the skylight.
The skylight was being mysteriously opened. A dark face peered into
the attic; then another face appeared behind it, and both looked in
with signs of caution and interest. Two men were outside on the roof,
and were making silent preparations to enter through the skylight
itself. One was Ram Dass and the other was a young man who was the
Indian gentleman's secretary; but of course Melchisedec did not know
this. He (<font color='blue'><b>secretary</b></font>) only knew that the men were invading the silence and privacy
of the attic; and as the one with the dark face let himself down
through the aperture with such lightness and dexterity that he (<font color='blue'><b>secretary</b></font>) did not
make the slightest sound, Melchisedec turned tail and fled
precipitately back to his (<font color='blue'><b>secretary</b></font>) hole. He (<font color='blue'><b>secretary</b></font>) was frightened to death. He (<font color='blue'><b>secretary</b></font>) had
ceased to be timid with Sara, and knew she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) would never throw anything
but crumbs, and would never make any sound other than the soft, low,
coaxing whistling; but strange men were dangerous things to remain
near. He (<font color='blue'><b>secretary</b></font>) lay close and flat near the entrance of his (<font color='blue'><b>secretary</b></font>) home, just
managing to peep through the crack with a bright, alarmed eye. How much
he (<font color='blue'><b>secretary</b></font>) understood of the talk he (<font color='blue'><b>secretary</b></font>) heard I am not in the least able to say;
but, even if he (<font color='blue'><b>secretary</b></font>) had understood it all, he (<font color='blue'><b>secretary</b></font>) would probably have remained
greatly mystified.

<p/>The secretary, who was light and young, slipped through the skylight as
noiselessly as Ram Dass had done; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Dass</b></font>) caught a last glimpse of
Melchisedec's vanishing tail.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Was that a rat?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Dass</b></font>) asked Ram Dass in a whisper.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; a rat, Sahib,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ram Dass</b></font>)</div>answered Ram Dass, also whispering. <div class="bookquote">``There are
many in the walls.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ugh!''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>exclaimed the young man. <div class="bookquote">``It is a wonder the child is not
terrified of them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ram Dass</b></font>)</div><p/>Ram Dass made a gesture with his (<font color='blue'><b>Dass</b></font>) hands. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dass</b></font>) also smiled respectfully.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Dass</b></font>) was in this place as the intimate exponent of Sara, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) had
only spoken to him (<font color='blue'><b>Dass</b></font>) once.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The child is the little friend of all things, Sahib,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Dass</b></font>) answered.
<div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) is not as other children. I see her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) when she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) does not see me. I
slip across the slates and look at her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) many nights to see that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) is
safe. I watch her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) from my window when she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) does not know I am near. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
stands on the table there and looks out at the sky as if it spoke to
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). The sparrows come at her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) call. The rat she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) has fed and tamed in
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) loneliness. The poor slave of the house comes to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) for comfort.
There is a little child who comes to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) in secret; there is one older
who worships her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) and would listen to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) forever if she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) might. This I
have seen when I have crept across the roof. By the mistress of the
house--who is an evil woman--she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is treated like a pariah; but she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) has
the bearing of a child who is of the blood of kings!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You seem to know a great deal about her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>the secretary</b></font>)</div>the secretary said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``All her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) life each day I know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ram Dass</b></font>)</div>answered Ram Dass. <div class="bookquote">``Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) going out I
know, and her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) coming in; her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) sadness and her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) poor joys; her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) coldness
and her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hunger. I know when she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is alone until midnight, learning from
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) books; I know when her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) secret friends steal to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is
happier--as children can be, even in the midst of poverty--because they
come and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) may laugh and talk with them in whispers. If she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) were ill
I should know, and I would come and serve her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) if it might be done.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are sure no one comes near this place but herself, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
will not return and surprise us. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would be frightened if she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) found
us here, and the Sahib Carrisford's plan would be spoiled.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ram Dass</b></font>)</div><p/>Ram Dass crossed noiselessly to the door and stood close to it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``None mount here but herself, Sahib,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Dass</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) has gone out with
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) basket and may be gone for hours. If I stand here I can hear any
step before it reaches the last flight of the stairs.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The secretary</b></font>)</div><p/>The secretary took a pencil and a tablet from his (<font color='blue'><b>Dass</b></font>) breast pocket.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Keep your ears open,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Dass</b></font>) said; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Dass</b></font>) began to walk slowly and softly
round the miserable little room, making rapid notes on his (<font color='blue'><b>Dass</b></font>) tablet as he (<font color='blue'><b>Dass</b></font>)
looked at things.

<p/>First he (<font color='blue'><b>Dass</b></font>) went to the narrow bed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dass</b></font>) pressed his (<font color='blue'><b>Dass</b></font>) hand upon the mattress
and uttered an exclamation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``As hard as a stone,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Dass</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``That will have to be altered some day
when she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is out. A special journey can be made to bring it across. It
cannot be done tonight.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Dass</b></font>) lifted the covering and examined the one
thin pillow.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Coverlet dingy and worn, blanket thin, sheets patched and ragged,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Dass</b></font>)
said. <div class="bookquote">``What a bed for a child to sleep in--and in a house which calls
itself respectable! There has not been a fire in that grate for many a
day,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>glancing at the rusty fireplace.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Never since I have seen it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ram Dass</b></font>)</div>said Ram Dass. <div class="bookquote">``The mistress of the
house is not one who remembers that another than herself may be cold.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The secretary</b></font>)</div><p/>The secretary was writing quickly on his (<font color='blue'><b>secretary</b></font>) tablet. He (<font color='blue'><b>secretary</b></font>) looked up from it
as he (<font color='blue'><b>secretary</b></font>) tore off a leaf and slipped it into his (<font color='blue'><b>secretary</b></font>) breast pocket.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is a strange way of doing the thing,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>secretary</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Who planned it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ram Dass</b></font>)</div><p/>Ram Dass made a modestly apologetic obeisance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is true that the first thought was mine, Sahib,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Dass</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``though
it was naught but a fancy. I am fond of this child; we are both
lonely. It is her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) way to relate her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) visions to her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) secret friends.
Being sad one night, I lay close to the open skylight and listened. The
vision she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) related told what this miserable room might be if it had
comforts in it. She (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) seemed to see it as she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) talked, and she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) grew
cheered and warmed as she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) spoke. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) came to this fancy; and the
next day, the Sahib being ill and wretched, I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Sahib</b></font>) of the thing to
amuse him (<font color='blue'><b>Sahib</b></font>). It seemed then but a dream, but it pleased the Sahib. To
hear of the child's doings gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Sahib</b></font>) entertainment. He (<font color='blue'><b>Sahib</b></font>) became interested
in her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) and asked questions. At last he (<font color='blue'><b>Sahib</b></font>) began to please himself with
the thought of making her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) visions real things.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You think that it can be done while she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) sleeps? Suppose she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>)
awakened,''  (<font color='red'><b>the secretary</b></font>)</div>suggested the secretary; and it was evident that whatsoever
the plan referred to was, it had caught and pleased his (<font color='blue'><b>Dass</b></font>) fancy as well
as the Sahib Carrisford's.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can move as if my feet were of velvet,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ram Dass</b></font>)</div>Ram Dass replied; <div class="bookquote">``and
children sleep soundly--even the unhappy ones. I could have entered
this room in the night many times, and without causing her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) to turn upon
her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) pillow. If the other bearer passes to me the things through the
window, I can do all and she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) will not stir. When she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) awakens she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) will
think a magician has been here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ram Dass</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Dass</b></font>) smiled as if his (<font color='blue'><b>Dass</b></font>) heart warmed under his (<font color='blue'><b>Dass</b></font>) white robe, and the
secretary smiled back at him (<font color='blue'><b>secretary</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It will be like a story from the Arabian Nights,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>secretary</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Only an
Oriental could have planned it. It does not belong to London fogs.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Melchisedec/Mrs. Melchisedec</b></font>)</div><p/>They did not remain very long, to the great relief of Melchisedec, who,
as he (<font color='blue'><b>secretary</b></font>) probably did not comprehend their conversation, felt their
movements and whispers ominous. The young secretary seemed interested
in everything. He (<font color='blue'><b>secretary</b></font>) wrote down things about the floor, the fireplace,
the broken footstool, the old table, the walls--which last he (<font color='blue'><b>secretary</b></font>) touched
with his (<font color='blue'><b>secretary</b></font>) hand again and again, seeming much pleased when he (<font color='blue'><b>secretary</b></font>) found that
a number of old nails had been driven in various places.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You can hang things on them,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>secretary</b></font>) said.

<p/>Ram Dass smiled mysteriously.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yesterday, when she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) was out,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>secretary</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I entered, bringing with me
small, sharp nails which can be pressed into the wall without blows
from a hammer. I placed many in the plaster where I may need them.
They are ready.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The Indian gentleman's secretary stood still and looked round him (<font color='blue'><b>secretary</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>secretary</b></font>)
thrust his (<font color='blue'><b>secretary</b></font>) tablets back into his (<font color='blue'><b>secretary</b></font>) pocket.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think I have made notes enough; we can go now,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>secretary</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``The Sahib
Carrisford has a warm heart. It is a thousand pities that he (<font color='blue'><b>Carrisford</b></font>) has not
found the lost child.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If he (<font color='blue'><b>Carrisford</b></font>) should find her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Carrisford</b></font>) strength would be restored to him (<font color='blue'><b>Carrisford</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Ram Dass</b></font>)</div>said Ram
Dass. <div class="bookquote">``His (<font color='blue'><b>Carrisford</b></font>) God may lead her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) to him (<font color='blue'><b>Carrisford</b></font>) yet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Then they slipped through the skylight as noiselessly as they had
entered it. And, after he (<font color='blue'><b>Dass</b></font>) was quite sure they had gone, Melchisedec
was greatly relieved, and in the course of a few minutes felt it safe
to emerge from his (<font color='blue'><b>Dass</b></font>) hole again and scuffle about in the hope that even
such alarming human beings as these might have chanced to carry crumbs
in their pockets and drop one or two of them.



<p/>15

<p/>The Magic


<p/>When Sara had passed the house next door she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) had seen Ram Dass closing
the shutters, and caught her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) glimpse of this room also.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is a long time since I saw a nice place from the inside,''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>was the
thought which crossed her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) mind.

<p/>There was the usual bright fire glowing in the grate, and the Indian
gentleman was sitting before it. His (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) head was resting in his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) hand, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) looked as lonely and unhappy as ever.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Poor man!''  (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>said Sara. <div class="bookquote">``I wonder what you are supposing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And this was what he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was <div class="bookquote">``supposing''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>at that very moment.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Suppose,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was thinking, <div class="bookquote">``suppose--even if Carmichael traces the
people to Moscow--the little girl they took from Madame Pascal's school
in Paris is NOT the one we are in search of. Suppose she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) proves to be
quite a different child. What steps shall I take next?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>When Sara went into the house she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) met Miss Minchin, who had come
downstairs to scold the cook.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where have you wasted your time?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) demanded. <div class="bookquote">``You have been out
for hours.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It was so wet and muddy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>Sara answered, <div class="bookquote">``it was hard to walk, because
my shoes were so bad and slipped about.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Make no excuses,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Minchin/MISS MINCHIN</b></font>)</div>said Miss Minchin, <div class="bookquote">``and tell no falsehoods.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Minchin/MISS MINCHIN</b></font>)</div><p/>Sara went in to the cook. The cook had received a severe lecture and
was in a fearful temper as a result. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) was only too rejoiced to have
someone to vent her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) rage on, and Sara was a convenience, as usual.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why didn't you stay all night?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) snapped.

<p/>Sara laid her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) purchases on the table.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here are the things,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) said.

<p/>The cook looked them over, grumbling. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) was in a very savage humor
indeed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``May I have something to eat?''  (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>Sara asked rather faintly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tea's over and done with,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was the answer. <div class="bookquote">``Did you expect me to keep
it hot for you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div><p/>Sara stood silent for a second.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I had no dinner,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) said next, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) voice was quite low. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>)
made it low because she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) was afraid it would tremble.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There's some bread in the pantry,''  (<font color='red'><b>the cook</b></font>)</div>said the cook. <div class="bookquote">``That's all you'll
get at this time of day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div><p/>Sara went and found the bread. It was old and hard and dry. The cook
was in too vicious a humor to give her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) anything to eat with it. It was
always safe and easy to vent her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) spite on Sara. Really, it was hard
for the child to climb the three long flights of stairs leading to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>)
attic. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) often found them long and steep when she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) was tired; but
tonight it seemed as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) would never reach the top. Several times
she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) was obliged to stop to rest. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) reached the top landing she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>)
was glad to see the glimmer of a light coming from under her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) door.
That meant that Ermengarde had managed to creep up to pay her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) a visit.
There was some comfort in that. It was better than to go into the room
alone and find it empty and desolate. The mere presence of plump,
comfortable Ermengarde, wrapped in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) red shawl, would warm it a
little.

<p/>Yes; there Ermengarde was when she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) opened the door. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) was sitting in
the middle of the bed, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) feet tucked safely under her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) had
never become intimate with Melchisedec and his (<font color='blue'><b>Ermengarde</b></font>) family, though they
rather fascinated her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>). When she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) found herself alone in the attic she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>)
always preferred to sit on the bed until Sara arrived. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) had, in
fact, on this occasion had time to become rather nervous, because
Melchisedec had appeared and sniffed about a good deal, and once had
made her (<font color='blue'><b>Melchisedec</b></font>) utter a repressed squeal by sitting up on his (<font color='blue'><b>Ermengarde</b></font>) hind legs and,
while he (<font color='blue'><b>Ermengarde</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Melchisedec</b></font>), sniffing pointedly in her (<font color='blue'><b>Melchisedec</b></font>) direction.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Sara,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Melchisedec</b></font>) cried out, <div class="bookquote">``I am glad you have come. Melchy WOULD
sniff about so. I tried to coax him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) to go back, but he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) wouldn't for
such a long time. I like him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>), you know; but it does frighten me when
he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) sniffs right at me. Do you think he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) ever WOULD jump?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>answered Sara.

<p/>Ermengarde crawled forward on the bed to look at her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You DO look tired, Sara,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``you are quite pale.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I AM tired,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>said Sara, dropping on to the lopsided footstool. <div class="bookquote">``Oh,
there's Melchisedec, poor thing. He (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)'s come to ask for his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) supper.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Melchisedec/Mrs. Melchisedec</b></font>)</div><p/>Melchisedec had come out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ermengarde</b></font>) hole as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Ermengarde</b></font>) had been listening for
her (<font color='blue'><b>Melchisedec</b></font>) footstep. Sara was quite sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Ermengarde</b></font>) knew it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ermengarde</b></font>) came forward with an
affectionate, expectant expression as Sara put her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) hand in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) pocket
and turned it inside out, shaking her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) head.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm very sorry,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I haven't one crumb left. Go home,
Melchisedec, and tell your wife there was nothing in my pocket. I'm
afraid I forgot because the cook and Miss Minchin were so cross.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Melchisedec</b></font>)</div><p/>Melchisedec seemed to understand. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ermengarde</b></font>) shuffled resignedly, if not
contentedly, back to his (<font color='blue'><b>Ermengarde</b></font>) home.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I did not expect to see you tonight, Ermie,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>Sara said. Ermengarde
hugged herself in the red shawl.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Amelia has gone out to spend the night with her (<font color='blue'><b>Amelia</b></font>) old aunt,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>)
explained. <div class="bookquote">``No one else ever comes and looks into the bedrooms after
we are in bed. I could stay here until morning if I wanted to.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) pointed toward the table under the skylight. Sara had not looked
toward it as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) came in. A number of books were piled upon it.
Ermengarde's gesture was a dejected one.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Papa has sent me some more books, Sara,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``There they are.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div><p/>Sara looked round and got up at once. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) ran to the table, and
picking up the top volume, turned over its leaves quickly. For the
moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) forgot her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) discomforts.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) cried out, <div class="bookquote">``how beautiful! Carlyle's French Revolution. I
have SO wanted to read that!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I haven't,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ermengarde/John/Ermengarde St. John</b></font>)</div>said Ermengarde. <div class="bookquote">``And papa will be so cross if I don't.
He (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>)'ll expect me to know all about it when I go home for the holidays.
What SHALL I do?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div><p/>Sara stopped turning over the leaves and looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) with an excited
flush on her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) cheeks.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Look here,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) cried, <div class="bookquote">``if you'll lend me these books, _I'll_ read
them--and tell you everything that's in them afterward--and I'll tell
it so that you will remember it, too.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, goodness!''  (<font color='red'><b>Ermengarde/John/Ermengarde St. John</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Ermengarde. <div class="bookquote">``Do you think you can?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know I can,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>Sara answered. <div class="bookquote">``The little ones always remember what I
tell them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sara,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ermengarde/John/Ermengarde St. John</b></font>)</div>said Ermengarde, hope gleaming in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) round face, <div class="bookquote">``if you'll do
that, and make me remember, I'll--I'll give you anything.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ermengarde/John/Ermengarde St. John</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't want you to give me anything,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>said Sara. <div class="bookquote">``I want your
books--I want them!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>And her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) eyes grew big, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) chest heaved.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Take them, then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ermengarde/John/Ermengarde St. John</b></font>)</div>said Ermengarde. <div class="bookquote">``I wish I wanted them--but I
don't. I'm not clever, and my father is, and he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) thinks I ought to be.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div><p/>Sara was opening one book after the other. <div class="bookquote">``What are you going to tell
your father?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) asked, a slight doubt dawning in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) mind.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) needn't know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ermengarde/John/Ermengarde St. John</b></font>)</div>answered Ermengarde. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)'ll think I've read
them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div><p/>Sara put down her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) book and shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) head slowly. <div class="bookquote">``That's almost like
telling lies,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``And lies--well, you see, they are not only
wicked--they're VULGAR. Sometimes'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--reflectively--``I've thought perhaps
I might do something wicked--I might suddenly fly into a rage and kill
Miss Minchin, you know, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) was ill-treating me--but I COULDN<div class="bookquote">``T be
vulgar. Why can't you tell your father _I_ read them?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) wants me to read them,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ermengarde/John/Ermengarde St. John</b></font>)</div>said Ermengarde, a little discouraged by
this unexpected turn of affairs.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) wants you to know what is in them,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>said Sara. <div class="bookquote">``And if I can tell
it to you in an easy way and make you remember it, I should think he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
would like that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)'ll like it if I learn anything in ANY way,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said rueful Ermengarde.
<div class="bookquote">``You would if you were my father.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's not your fault that--''  (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>began Sara. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) pulled herself up and
stopped rather suddenly. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) had been going to say, <div class="bookquote">``It's not your
fault that you are stupid.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That what?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ermengarde/John/Ermengarde St. John</b></font>)</div>Ermengarde asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That you can't learn things quickly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>amended Sara. <div class="bookquote">``If you can't,
you can't. If I can--why, I can; that's all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) always felt very tender of Ermengarde, and tried not to let her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>)
feel too strongly the difference between being able to learn anything
at once, and not being able to learn anything at all. As she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) looked at
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) plump face, one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) wise, old-fashioned thoughts came to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``to be able to learn things quickly isn't
everything. To be kind is worth a great deal to other people. If Miss
Minchin knew everything on earth and was like what she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) is now, she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>)'d
still be a detestable thing, and everybody would hate her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>). Lots of
clever people have done harm and have been wicked. Look at
Robespierre--''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) stopped and examined Ermengarde's countenance, which was beginning
to look bewildered. <div class="bookquote">``Don't you remember?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) demanded. <div class="bookquote">``I told you
about him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) not long ago. I believe you've forgotten.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I don't remember ALL of it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ermengarde/John/Ermengarde St. John</b></font>)</div>admitted Ermengarde.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, you wait a minute,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>said Sara, <div class="bookquote">``and I'll take off my wet things
and wrap myself in the coverlet and tell you over again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) took off her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) hat and coat and hung them on a nail against the wall,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) changed her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) wet shoes for an old pair of slippers. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>)
jumped on the bed, and drawing the coverlet about her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) shoulders, sat
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) arms round her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) knees. <div class="bookquote">``Now, listen,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) said.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) plunged into the gory records of the French Revolution, and told
such stories of it that Ermengarde's eyes grew round with alarm and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>)
held her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) breath. But though she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) was rather terrified, there was a
delightful thrill in listening, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) was not likely to forget
Robespierre again, or to have any doubts about the Princesse de
Lamballe.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You know they put her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) head on a pike and danced round it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>Sara
explained. <div class="bookquote">``And she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) had beautiful floating blonde hair; and when I
think of her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>), I never see her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) head on her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) body, but always on a pike,
with those furious people dancing and howling.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. St. John</b></font>)</div><p/>It was agreed that Mr. St. John was to be told the plan they had made,
and for the present the books were to be left in the attic.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now let's tell each other things,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>said Sara. <div class="bookquote">``How are you getting on
with your French lessons?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ever so much better since the last time I came up here and you
explained the conjugations. Miss Minchin could not understand why I
did my exercises so well that first morning.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div><p/>Sara laughed a little and hugged her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) knees.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) doesn't understand why Lottie is doing her (<font color='blue'><b>Lottie</b></font>) sums so well,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>)
said; <div class="bookquote">``but it is because she (<font color='blue'><b>Lottie</b></font>) creeps up here, too, and I help her (<font color='blue'><b>Lottie</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>)
glanced round the room. <div class="bookquote">``The attic would be rather nice--if it wasn't
so dreadful,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) said, laughing again. <div class="bookquote">``It's a good place to pretend
in.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ermengarde/John/Ermengarde St. John</b></font>)</div><p/>The truth was that Ermengarde did not know anything of the sometimes
almost unbearable side of life in the attic and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) had not a
sufficiently vivid imagination to depict it for herself. On the rare
occasions that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) could reach Sara's room she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) only saw the side of it
which was made exciting by things which were <div class="bookquote">``pretended''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and stories
which were told. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) visits partook of the character of adventures;
and though sometimes Sara looked rather pale, and it was not to be
denied that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) had grown very thin, her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) proud little spirit would not
admit of complaints. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) had never confessed that at times she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) was
almost ravenous with hunger, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) was tonight. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) was growing
rapidly, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) constant walking and running about would have given
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) a keen appetite even if she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) had had abundant and regular meals of a
much more nourishing nature than the unappetizing, inferior food
snatched at such odd times as suited the kitchen convenience. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) was
growing used to a certain gnawing feeling in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) young stomach.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose soldiers feel like this when they are on a long and weary
march,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) often said to herself. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) liked the sound of the phrase,
<div class="bookquote">``long and weary march.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>It made her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) feel rather like a soldier. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>)
had also a quaint sense of being a hostess in the attic.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If I lived in a castle,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) argued, <div class="bookquote">``and Ermengarde was the lady of
another castle, and came to see me, with knights and squires and
vassals riding with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), and pennons flying, when I heard the clarions
sounding outside the drawbridge I should go down to receive her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), and I
should spread feasts in the banquet hall and call in minstrels to sing
and play and relate romances. When she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) comes into the attic I can't
spread feasts, but I can tell stories, and not let her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) know
disagreeable things. I dare say poor chatelaines had to do that in
time of famine, when their lands had been pillaged.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) was a proud,
brave little chatelaine, and dispensed generously the one hospitality
she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) could offer--the dreams she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) dreamed--the visions she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) saw--the
imaginings which were her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) joy and comfort.

<p/>So, as they sat together, Ermengarde did not know that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) was faint as
well as ravenous, and that while she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) talked she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) now and then wondered
if her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) hunger would let her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) sleep when she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) was left alone. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) felt as
if she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) had never been quite so hungry before.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish I was as thin as you, Sara,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ermengarde/John/Ermengarde St. John</b></font>)</div>Ermengarde said suddenly. <div class="bookquote">``I
believe you are thinner than you used to be. Your eyes look so big,
and look at the sharp little bones sticking out of your elbow!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div><p/>Sara pulled down her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) sleeve, which had pushed itself up.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I always was a thin child,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) said bravely, <div class="bookquote">``and I always had big
green eyes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I love your queer eyes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ermengarde/John/Ermengarde St. John</b></font>)</div>said Ermengarde, looking into them with
affectionate admiration. <div class="bookquote">``They always look as if they saw such a long
way. I love them--and I love them to be green--though they look black
generally.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They are cat's eyes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>laughed Sara; <div class="bookquote">``but I can't see in the dark with
them--because I have tried, and I couldn't--I wish I could.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div><p/>It was just at this minute that something happened at the skylight
which neither of them saw. If either of them had chanced to turn and
look, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) would have been startled by the sight of a dark face which
peered cautiously into the room and disappeared as quickly and almost
as silently as it had appeared. Not QUITE as silently, however. Sara,
who had keen ears, suddenly turned a little and looked up at the roof.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That didn't sound like Melchisedec,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``It wasn't scratchy
enough.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ermengarde/John/Ermengarde St. John</b></font>)</div>said Ermengarde, a little startled.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Didn't you think you heard something?''  (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>asked Sara.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``N-no,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ermengarde/John/Ermengarde St. John</b></font>)</div>Ermengarde faltered. <div class="bookquote">``Did you?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>-LCB-another ed. has <div class="bookquote">``No-no,'' (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>-RCB-

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps I didn't,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>said Sara; <div class="bookquote">``but I thought I did. It sounded as if
something was on the slates--something that dragged softly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What could it be?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ermengarde/John/Ermengarde St. John</b></font>)</div>said Ermengarde. <div class="bookquote">``Could it be--robbers?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>Sara began cheerfully. <div class="bookquote">``There is nothing to steal--''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) broke off in the middle of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) words. They both heard the sound
that checked her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>). It was not on the slates, but on the stairs below,
and it was Miss Minchin's angry voice. Sara sprang off the bed, and
put out the candle.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Melchisedec</b></font>) is scolding Becky,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) whispered, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) stood in the darkness.
<div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Melchisedec</b></font>) is making her (<font color='blue'><b>Melchisedec</b></font>) cry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Will she (<font color='blue'><b>Melchisedec</b></font>) come in here?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ermengarde/John/Ermengarde St. John</b></font>)</div>Ermengarde whispered back, panic-stricken.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No. She (<font color='blue'><b>Melchisedec</b></font>) will think I am in bed. Don't stir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Minchin/MISS MINCHIN</b></font>)</div><p/>It was very seldom that Miss Minchin mounted the last flight of stairs.
Sara could only remember that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) had done it once before. But now she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>)
was angry enough to be coming at least part of the way up, and it
sounded as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) was driving Becky before her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You impudent, dishonest child!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>they heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) say. <div class="bookquote">``Cook tells me
she (<font color='blue'><b>Melchisedec</b></font>) has missed things repeatedly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">'''T warn't me, mum,''  (<font color='red'><b>Becky</b></font>)</div>said Becky sobbing. <div class="bookquote">``I was `ungry enough, but 't
warn't me--never!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You deserve to be sent to prison,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Minchin/MISS MINCHIN</b></font>)</div>said Miss Minchin's voice.
<div class="bookquote">``Picking and stealing! Half a meat pie, indeed!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">'''T warn't me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Becky</b></font>)</div>wept Becky. <div class="bookquote">``I could `ave eat a whole un--but I never
laid a finger on it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Minchin/MISS MINCHIN</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Minchin was out of breath between temper and mounting the stairs.
The meat pie had been intended for her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) special late supper. It became
apparent that she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) boxed Becky's ears.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't tell falsehoods,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Go to your room this instant.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div><p/>Both Sara and Ermengarde heard the slap, and then heard Becky run in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) slipshod shoes up the stairs and into her (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) attic. They heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>)
door shut, and knew that she (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) threw herself upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) bed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I could `ave e't two of 'em,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>they heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) cry into her (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) pillow. ``An'
I never took a bite. <div class="bookquote">``Twas cook give it to her (<font color='blue'><b>'em</b></font>) policeman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div><p/>Sara stood in the middle of the room in the darkness. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) was
clenching her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) little teeth and opening and shutting fiercely her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>)
outstretched hands. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) could scarcely stand still, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) dared not
move until Miss Minchin had gone down the stairs and all was still.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The wicked, cruel thing!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) burst forth. ``The cook takes things
herself and then says Becky steals them. She (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) DOESN``T! She (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) DOESN<div class="bookquote">``T!
She (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>)'s so hungry sometimes that she (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) eats crusts out of the ash barrel!''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) pressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) hands hard against her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) face and burst into passionate
little sobs, and Ermengarde, hearing this unusual thing, was overawed
by it. Sara was crying! The unconquerable Sara! It seemed to denote
something new--some mood she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) had never known. Suppose--suppose--a new
dread possibility presented itself to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) kind, slow, little mind all
at once. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) crept off the bed in the dark and found her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) way to the
table where the candle stood. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) struck a match and lit the candle.
When she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) had lighted it, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) bent forward and looked at Sara, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>)
new thought growing to definite fear in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sara,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) said in a timid, almost awe-stricken voice, <div class="bookquote">``are--are--you
never told me--I don't want to be rude, but--are YOU ever hungry?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>It was too much just at that moment. The barrier broke down. Sara
lifted her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) face from her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) hands.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) said in a new passionate way. <div class="bookquote">``Yes, I am. I'm so hungry
now that I could almost eat you. And it makes it worse to hear poor
Becky. She (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>)'s hungrier than I am.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ermengarde/John/Ermengarde St. John</b></font>)</div><p/>Ermengarde gasped.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, oh!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) cried woefully. <div class="bookquote">``And I never knew!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I didn't want you to know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>Sara said. <div class="bookquote">``It would have made me feel
like a street beggar. I know I look like a street beggar.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, you don't--you don't!''  (<font color='red'><b>Ermengarde/John/Ermengarde St. John</b></font>)</div>Ermengarde broke in. <div class="bookquote">``Your clothes are a
little queer--but you couldn't look like a street beggar. You haven't
a street-beggar face.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A little boy once gave me a sixpence for charity,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>said Sara, with a
short little laugh in spite of herself. <div class="bookquote">``Here it is.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) pulled
out the thin ribbon from her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) neck. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) wouldn't have given me his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
Christmas sixpence if I hadn't looked as if I needed it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Somehow the sight of the dear little sixpence was good for both of
them. It made them laugh a little, though they both had tears in their
eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who was he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ermengarde/John/Ermengarde St. John</b></font>)</div>asked Ermengarde, looking at it quite as if it had not
been a mere ordinary silver sixpence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was a darling little thing going to a party,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>said Sara. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was
one of the Large Family, the little one with the round legs--the one I
call Guy Clarence. I suppose his (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) nursery was crammed with Christmas
presents and hampers full of cakes and things, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>) could see I had
nothing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ermengarde/John/Ermengarde St. John</b></font>)</div><p/>Ermengarde gave a little jump backward. The last sentences had
recalled something to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) troubled mind and given her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) a sudden
inspiration.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Sara!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) cried. <div class="bookquote">``What a silly thing I am not to have thought of
it!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of what?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Something splendid!''  (<font color='red'><b>Ermengarde/John/Ermengarde St. John</b></font>)</div>said Ermengarde, in an excited hurry. <div class="bookquote">``This very
afternoon my nicest aunt sent me a box. It is full of good things. I
never touched it, I had so much pudding at dinner, and I was so
bothered about papa's books.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) words began to tumble over each
other. <div class="bookquote">``It's got cake in it, and little meat pies, and jam tarts and
buns, and oranges and red-currant wine, and figs and chocolate. I'll
creep back to my room and get it this minute, and we'll eat it now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div><p/>Sara almost reeled. When one is faint with hunger the mention of food
has sometimes a curious effect. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) clutched Ermengarde's arm.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you think--you COULD?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) ejaculated.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I know I could,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ermengarde/John/Ermengarde St. John</b></font>)</div>answered Ermengarde, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) ran to the door--opened
it softly--put her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) head out into the darkness, and listened. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>)
went back to Sara. <div class="bookquote">``The lights are out. Everybody's in bed. I can
creep--and creep--and no one will hear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div><p/>It was so delightful that they caught each other's hands and a sudden
light sprang into Sara's eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ermie!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Let us PRETEND! Let us pretend it's a party! And
oh, won't you invite the prisoner in the next cell?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes! Yes! Let us knock on the wall now. The jailer won't hear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div><p/>Sara went to the wall. Through it she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) could hear poor Becky crying
more softly. She (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) knocked four times.

<p/>``That means, ``Come to me through the secret passage under the wall,''
she (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) explained. <div class="bookquote">``I have something to communicate.'''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>Five quick knocks answered her (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) is coming,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) said.

<p/>Almost immediately the door of the attic opened and Becky appeared. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>)
eyes were red and her (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) cap was sliding off, and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) caught sight of
Ermengarde she (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) began to rub her (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) face nervously with her (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) apron.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't mind me a bit, Becky!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>cried Ermengarde.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Ermengarde has asked you to come in,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>said Sara, <div class="bookquote">``because she (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) is
going to bring a box of good things up here to us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div><p/>Becky's cap almost fell off entirely, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) broke in with such excitement.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``To eat, miss?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Things that's good to eat?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>answered Sara, <div class="bookquote">``and we are going to pretend a party.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you shall have as much as you WANT to eat,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>put in Ermengarde.
<div class="bookquote">``I'll go this minute!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) was in such haste that as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) tiptoed out of the attic she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) dropped
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) red shawl and did not know it had fallen. No one saw it for a
minute or so. Becky was too much overpowered by the good luck which
had befallen her (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, miss! oh, miss!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) gasped; <div class="bookquote">``I know it was you that asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) to
let me come. It--it makes me cry to think of it.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) went to
Sara's side and stood and looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) worshipingly.

<p/>But in Sara's hungry eyes the old light had begun to glow and transform
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) world for her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>). Here in the attic--with the cold night
outside--with the afternoon in the sloppy streets barely passed--with
the memory of the awful unfed look in the beggar child's eyes not yet
faded--this simple, cheerful thing had happened like a thing of magic.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) caught her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) breath.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Somehow, something always happens,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) cried, <div class="bookquote">``just before things get
to the very worst. It is as if the Magic did it. If I could only just
remember that always. The worst thing never QUITE comes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) gave Becky a little cheerful shake.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no! You mustn't cry!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``We must make haste and set the
table.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Set the table, miss?''  (<font color='red'><b>Becky</b></font>)</div>said Becky, gazing round the room. <div class="bookquote">``What'll we
set it with?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div><p/>Sara looked round the attic, too.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There doesn't seem to be much,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) answered, half laughing.

<p/>That moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) saw something and pounced upon it. It was Ermengarde's
red shawl which lay upon the floor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here's the shawl,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) cried. <div class="bookquote">``I know she (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) won't mind it. It will make
such a nice red tablecloth.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They pulled the old table forward, and threw the shawl over it. Red is
a wonderfully kind and comfortable color. It began to make the room
look furnished directly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How nice a red rug would look on the floor!''  (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Sara. <div class="bookquote">``We must
pretend there is one!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) eye swept the bare boards with a swift glance of admiration. The
rug was laid down already.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How soft and thick it is!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) said, with the little laugh which Becky
knew the meaning of; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) raised and set her (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) foot down again
delicately, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) felt something under it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, miss,''  (<font color='red'><b>Becky</b></font>)</div>answered Becky, watching her (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) with serious rapture. She (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>)
was always quite serious.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What next, now?''  (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>said Sara, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) stood still and put her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) hands over
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) eyes. <div class="bookquote">``Something will come if I think and wait a little'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--in a
soft, expectant voice. <div class="bookquote">``The Magic will tell me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>One of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) favorite fancies was that on <div class="bookquote">``the outside,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) called
it, thoughts were waiting for people to call them. Becky had seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>)
stand and wait many a time before, and knew that in a few seconds she (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>)
would uncover an enlightened, laughing face.

<p/>In a moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) did.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) cried. <div class="bookquote">``It has come! I know now! I must look among the
things in the old trunk I had when I was a princess.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) flew to its corner and kneeled down. It had not been put in the
attic for her (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) benefit, but because there was no room for it elsewhere.
Nothing had been left in it but rubbish. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) knew she (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) should find
something. The Magic always arranged that kind of thing in one way or
another.

<p/>In a corner lay a package so insignificant-looking that it had been
overlooked, and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) herself had found it she (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) had kept it as a
relic. It contained a dozen small white handkerchiefs. She (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) seized
them joyfully and ran to the table. She (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) began to arrange them upon the
red table-cover, patting and coaxing them into shape with the narrow
lace edge curling outward, her (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) Magic working its spells for her (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>)
did it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``These are the plates,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``They are golden plates. These are
the richly embroidered napkins. Nuns worked them in convents in Spain.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did they, miss?''  (<font color='red'><b>Becky</b></font>)</div>breathed Becky, her (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) very soul uplifted by the
information.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You must pretend it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>said Sara. <div class="bookquote">``If you pretend it enough, you will
see them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, miss,''  (<font color='red'><b>Becky</b></font>)</div>said Becky; and as Sara returned to the trunk she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) devoted
herself to the effort of accomplishing an end so much to be desired.

<p/>Sara turned suddenly to find her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) standing by the table, looking very
queer indeed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) had shut her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) eyes, and was twisting her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) face in
strange convulsive contortions, her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) hands hanging stiffly clenched at
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) sides. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) looked as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) was trying to lift some enormous
weight.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is the matter, Becky?''  (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>Sara cried. <div class="bookquote">``What are you doing?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Becky</b></font>)</div><p/>Becky opened her (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) eyes with a start.

<p/>``I was a-``pretendin',<div class="bookquote">'' miss,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) answered a little sheepishly; <div class="bookquote">``I was
tryin' to see it like you do. I almost did,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>with a hopeful grin. <div class="bookquote">``But
it takes a lot o' stren'th.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps it does if you are not used to it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>said Sara, with friendly
sympathy; <div class="bookquote">``but you don't know how easy it is when you've done it often.
I wouldn't try so hard just at first. It will come to you after a
while. I'll just tell you what things are. Look at these.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) held an old summer hat in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) hand which she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) had fished out of the
bottom of the trunk. There was a wreath of flowers on it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) pulled
the wreath off.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``These are garlands for the feast,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) said grandly. <div class="bookquote">``They fill all
the air with perfume. There's a mug on the wash-stand, Becky. Oh--and
bring the soap dish for a centerpiece.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Becky</b></font>)</div><p/>Becky handed them to her (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) reverently.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What are they now, miss?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) inquired. <div class="bookquote">``You'd think they was made of
crockery--but I know they ain't.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``This is a carven flagon,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>said Sara, arranging tendrils of the wreath
about the mug. <div class="bookquote">``And this'' (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>--bending tenderly over the soap dish and
heaping it with roses--<div class="bookquote">``is purest alabaster encrusted with gems.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) touched the things gently, a happy smile hovering about her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) lips
which made her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) look as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) were a creature in a dream.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My, ain't it lovely!''  (<font color='red'><b>Becky</b></font>)</div>whispered Becky.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If we just had something for bonbon dishes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>Sara murmured.
<div class="bookquote">``There!'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--darting to the trunk again. <div class="bookquote">``I remember I saw something this
minute.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>It was only a bundle of wool wrapped in red and white tissue paper, but
the tissue paper was soon twisted into the form of little dishes, and
was combined with the remaining flowers to ornament the candlestick
which was to light the feast. Only the Magic could have made it more
than an old table covered with a red shawl and set with rubbish from a
long-unopened trunk. But Sara drew back and gazed at it, seeing
wonders; and Becky, after staring in delight, spoke with bated breath.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This `ere,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) suggested, with a glance round the attic--<div class="bookquote">``is it the
Bastille now--or has it turned into somethin' different?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes, yes!''  (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>said Sara. <div class="bookquote">``Quite different. It is a banquet hall!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My eye, miss!''  (<font color='red'><b>Becky</b></font>)</div>ejaculated Becky. <div class="bookquote">``A blanket `all!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) turned to
view the splendors about her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) with awed bewilderment.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A banquet hall,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>said Sara. <div class="bookquote">``A vast chamber where feasts are given.
It has a vaulted roof, and a minstrels' gallery, and a huge chimney
filled with blazing oaken logs, and it is brilliant with waxen tapers
twinkling on every side.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My eye, Miss Sara!''  (<font color='red'><b>Becky</b></font>)</div>gasped Becky again.

<p/>Then the door opened, and Ermengarde came in, rather staggering under
the weight of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) hamper. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) started back with an exclamation of joy.
To enter from the chill darkness outside, and find one's self
confronted by a totally unanticipated festal board, draped with red,
adorned with white napery, and wreathed with flowers, was to feel that
the preparations were brilliant indeed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Sara!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) cried out. <div class="bookquote">``You are the cleverest girl I ever saw!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Isn't it nice?''  (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>said Sara. <div class="bookquote">``They are things out of my old trunk. I
asked my Magic, and it told me to go and look.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But oh, miss,''  (<font color='red'><b>Becky</b></font>)</div>cried Becky, <div class="bookquote">``wait till she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>)'s told you what they are!
They ain't just--oh, miss, please tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Becky</b></font>)</div>appealing to Sara.

<p/>So Sara told her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>), and because her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) Magic helped her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) made her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) ALMOST
see it all: the golden platters--the vaulted spaces--the blazing
logs--the twinkling waxen tapers. As the things were taken out of the
hamper--the frosted cakes--the fruits--the bonbons and the wine--the
feast became a splendid thing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's like a real party!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>cried Ermengarde.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's like a queen's table,''  (<font color='red'><b>Becky</b></font>)</div>sighed Becky.

<p/>Then Ermengarde had a sudden brilliant thought.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll tell you what, Sara,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Pretend you are a princess now
and this is a royal feast.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But it's your feast,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>said Sara; <div class="bookquote">``you must be the princess, and we
will be your maids of honor.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I can't,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ermengarde/John/Ermengarde St. John</b></font>)</div>said Ermengarde. <div class="bookquote">``I'm too fat, and I don't know how.
YOU be her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, if you want me to,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>said Sara.

<p/>But suddenly she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) thought of something else and ran to the rusty grate.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There is a lot of paper and rubbish stuffed in here!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) exclaimed.
<div class="bookquote">``If we light it, there will be a bright blaze for a few minutes, and we
shall feel as if it was a real fire.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) struck a match and lighted
it up with a great specious glow which illuminated the room.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``By the time it stops blazing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>Sara said, <div class="bookquote">``we shall forget about its
not being real.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) stood in the dancing glow and smiled.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Doesn't it LOOK real?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Now we will begin the party.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) led the way to the table. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) waved her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) hand graciously to
Ermengarde and Becky. She (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) was in the midst of her (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) dream.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Advance, fair damsels,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) said in her (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) happy dream-voice, <div class="bookquote">``and be
seated at the banquet table. My noble father, the king, who is absent
on a long journey, has commanded me to feast you.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) head
slightly toward the corner of the room. <div class="bookquote">``What, ho, there, minstrels!
Strike up with your viols and bassoons. Princesses,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) explained
rapidly to Ermengarde and Becky, <div class="bookquote">``always had minstrels to play at their
feasts. Pretend there is a minstrel gallery up there in the corner.
Now we will begin.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Becky</b></font>)</div><p/>They had barely had time to take their pieces of cake into their
hands--not one of them had time to do more, when--they all three sprang
to their feet and turned pale faces toward the
door--listening--listening.

<p/>Someone was coming up the stairs. There was no mistake about it. Each
of them recognized the angry, mounting tread and knew that the end of
all things had come.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's--the missus!''  (<font color='red'><b>Becky</b></font>)</div>choked Becky, and dropped her (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) piece of cake upon
the floor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>said Sara, her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) eyes growing shocked and large in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) small white
face. <div class="bookquote">``Miss Minchin has found us out.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Minchin/MISS MINCHIN</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Minchin struck the door open with a blow of her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) hand. She (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) was pale
herself, but it was with rage. She (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) looked from the frightened faces to
the banquet table, and from the banquet table to the last flicker of
the burnt paper in the grate.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have been suspecting something of this sort,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) exclaimed; <div class="bookquote">``but I
did not dream of such audacity. Lavinia was telling the truth.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>So they knew that it was Lavinia who had somehow guessed their secret
and had betrayed them. Miss Minchin strode over to Becky and boxed her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>)
ears for a second time.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You impudent creature!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``You leave the house in the
morning!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div><p/>Sara stood quite still, her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) eyes growing larger, her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) face paler.
Ermengarde burst into tears.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, don't send her (<font color='blue'><b>Lavinia</b></font>) away,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) sobbed. <div class="bookquote">``My aunt sent me the hamper.
We're--only--having a party.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So I see,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Minchin/MISS MINCHIN</b></font>)</div>said Miss Minchin, witheringly. <div class="bookquote">``With the Princess Sara at
the head of the table.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) turned fiercely on Sara. <div class="bookquote">``It is your
doing, I know,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) cried. <div class="bookquote">``Ermengarde would never have thought of
such a thing. You decorated the table, I suppose--with this rubbish.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) stamped her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) foot at Becky. <div class="bookquote">``Go to your attic!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) commanded, and
Becky stole away, her (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) face hidden in her (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) apron, her (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) shoulders shaking.

<p/>Then it was Sara's turn again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I will attend to you tomorrow. You shall have neither breakfast,
dinner, nor supper!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have not had either dinner or supper today, Miss Minchin,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>said
Sara, rather faintly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then all the better. You will have something to remember. Don't
stand there. Put those things into the hamper again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) began to sweep them off the table into the hamper herself, and
caught sight of Ermengarde's new books.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And you'' (<font color='red'><b>Ermengarde/John/Ermengarde St. John</b></font>)</div>--to Ermengarde--<div class="bookquote">``have brought your beautiful new books into
this dirty attic. Take them up and go back to bed. You will stay
there all day tomorrow, and I shall write to your papa. What would HE (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>)
say if he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) knew where you are tonight?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ermengarde/John/Ermengarde St. John</b></font>)</div><p/>Something she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) saw in Sara's grave, fixed gaze at this moment made her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>)
turn on her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) fiercely.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What are you thinking of?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) demanded. <div class="bookquote">``Why do you look at me like
that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I was wondering,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>answered Sara, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) had answered that notable day
in the schoolroom.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What were you wondering?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>It was very like the scene in the schoolroom. There was no pertness in
Sara's manner. It was only sad and quiet.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I was wondering,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) said in a low voice, <div class="bookquote">``what MY papa would say if
he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) knew where I am tonight.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Minchin was infuriated just as she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) had been before and her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) anger
expressed itself, as before, in an intemperate fashion. She (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) flew at
her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) and shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You insolent, unmanageable child!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) cried. <div class="bookquote">``How dare you! How
dare you!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) picked up the books, swept the rest of the feast back into the
hamper in a jumbled heap, thrust it into Ermengarde's arms, and pushed
her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) before her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) toward the door.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I will leave you to wonder,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Go to bed this instant.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And
she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) shut the door behind herself and poor stumbling Ermengarde, and
left Sara standing quite alone.

<p/>The dream was quite at an end. The last spark had died out of the
paper in the grate and left only black tinder; the table was left bare,
the golden plates and richly embroidered napkins, and the garlands were
transformed again into old handkerchiefs, scraps of red and white
paper, and discarded artificial flowers all scattered on the floor; the
minstrels in the minstrel gallery had stolen away, and the viols and
bassoons were still. Emily was sitting with her (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>) back against the wall,
staring very hard. Sara saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>), and went and picked her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) up with
trembling hands.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There isn't any banquet left, Emily,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``And there isn't any
princess. There is nothing left but the prisoners in the Bastille.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) sat down and hid her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) face.

<p/>What would have happened if she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) had not hidden it just then, and if she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>)
had chanced to look up at the skylight at the wrong moment, I do not
know--perhaps the end of this chapter might have been quite
different--because if she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) had glanced at the skylight she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) would
certainly have been startled by what she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) would have seen. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) would
have seen exactly the same face pressed against the glass and peering
in at her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) as it had peered in earlier in the evening when she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) had been
talking to Ermengarde.

<p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) did not look up. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) sat with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) little black head in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>)
arms for some time. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) always sat like that when she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) was trying to
bear something in silence. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) got up and went slowly to the bed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't pretend anything else--while I am awake,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``There
wouldn't be any use in trying. If I go to sleep, perhaps a dream will
come and pretend for me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) suddenly felt so tired--perhaps through want of food--that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) sat
down on the edge of the bed quite weakly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Suppose there was a bright fire in the grate, with lots of little
dancing flames,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) murmured. <div class="bookquote">``Suppose there was a comfortable chair
before it--and suppose there was a small table near, with a little
hot--hot supper on it. And suppose'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) drew the thin coverings
over her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>)--<div class="bookquote">``suppose this was a beautiful soft bed, with fleecy blankets
and large downy pillows. Suppose--suppose--''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) very weariness
was good to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>), for her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) eyes closed and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) fell fast asleep.


<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) did not know how long she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) slept. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) had been tired enough to
sleep deeply and profoundly--too deeply and soundly to be disturbed by
anything, even by the squeaks and scamperings of Melchisedec's entire
family, if all his (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) sons and daughters had chosen to come out of their
hole to fight and tumble and play.

<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Melchisedec</b></font>) awakened it was rather suddenly, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Melchisedec</b></font>) did not know that any
particular thing had called her (<font color='blue'><b>Melchisedec</b></font>) out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Melchisedec</b></font>) sleep. The truth was,
however, that it was a sound which had called her (<font color='blue'><b>Melchisedec</b></font>) back--a real
sound--the click of the skylight as it fell in closing after a lithe
white figure which slipped through it and crouched down close by upon
the slates of the roof--just near enough to see what happened in the
attic, but not near enough to be seen.

<p/>At first she (<font color='blue'><b>Melchisedec</b></font>) did not open her (<font color='blue'><b>Melchisedec</b></font>) eyes. She (<font color='blue'><b>Melchisedec</b></font>) felt too sleepy and--curiously
enough--too warm and comfortable. She (<font color='blue'><b>Melchisedec</b></font>) was so warm and comfortable,
indeed, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Melchisedec</b></font>) did not believe she (<font color='blue'><b>Melchisedec</b></font>) was really awake. She (<font color='blue'><b>Melchisedec</b></font>) never was as
warm and cozy as this except in some lovely vision.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What a nice dream!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Melchisedec</b></font>) murmured. <div class="bookquote">``I feel quite warm.
I--don't--want--to--wake--up.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Of course it was a dream. She (<font color='blue'><b>Melchisedec</b></font>) felt as if warm, delightful bedclothes
were heaped upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Melchisedec</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Melchisedec</b></font>) could actually FEEL blankets, and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Melchisedec</b></font>)
put out her (<font color='blue'><b>Melchisedec</b></font>) hand it touched something exactly like a satin-covered
eider-down quilt. She (<font color='blue'><b>Melchisedec</b></font>) must not awaken from this delight--she (<font color='blue'><b>Melchisedec</b></font>) must be
quite still and make it last.

<p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Melchisedec</b></font>) could not--even though she (<font color='blue'><b>Melchisedec</b></font>) kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Melchisedec</b></font>) eyes closed tightly, she (<font color='blue'><b>Melchisedec</b></font>)
could not. Something was forcing her (<font color='blue'><b>Melchisedec</b></font>) to awaken--something in the room.
It was a sense of light, and a sound--the sound of a crackling, roaring
little fire.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I am awakening,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Melchisedec</b></font>) said mournfully. <div class="bookquote">``I can't help it--I can't.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Melchisedec</b></font>) eyes opened in spite of herself. And then she (<font color='blue'><b>Melchisedec</b></font>) actually smiled--for
what she (<font color='blue'><b>Melchisedec</b></font>) saw she (<font color='blue'><b>Melchisedec</b></font>) had never seen in the attic before, and knew she (<font color='blue'><b>Melchisedec</b></font>) never
should see.

<p/>``Oh, I HAVEN``T awakened,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Melchisedec</b></font>) whispered, daring to rise on her (<font color='blue'><b>Melchisedec</b></font>) elbow
and look all about her (<font color='blue'><b>Melchisedec</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I am dreaming yet.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Melchisedec</b></font>) knew it MUST be a
dream, for if she (<font color='blue'><b>Melchisedec</b></font>) were awake such things could not--could not be.

<p/>Do you wonder that she (<font color='blue'><b>Melchisedec</b></font>) felt sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Melchisedec</b></font>) had not come back to earth? This
is what she (<font color='blue'><b>Melchisedec</b></font>) saw. In the grate there was a glowing, blazing fire; on
the hob was a little brass kettle hissing and boiling; spread upon the
floor was a thick, warm crimson rug; before the fire a folding-chair,
unfolded, and with cushions on it; by the chair a small folding-table,
unfolded, covered with a white cloth, and upon it spread small covered
dishes, a cup, a saucer, a teapot; on the bed were new warm coverings
and a satin-covered down quilt; at the foot a curious wadded silk robe,
a pair of quilted slippers, and some books. The room of her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) dream
seemed changed into fairyland--and it was flooded with warm light, for
a bright lamp stood on the table covered with a rosy shade.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) sat up, resting on her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) elbow, and her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) breathing came short and fast.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It does not--melt away,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) panted. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, I never had such a dream
before.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) scarcely dared to stir; but at last she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) pushed the
bedclothes aside, and put her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) feet on the floor with a rapturous smile.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am dreaming--I am getting out of bed,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) heard her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) own voice say;
and then, as she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) stood up in the midst of it all, turning slowly from
side to side--<div class="bookquote">``I am dreaming it stays--real! I'm dreaming it FEELS
real. It's bewitched--or I'm bewitched. I only THINK I see it all.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the midst</b></font>)</div>Her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) words began to hurry themselves. <div class="bookquote">``If I can only keep on thinking
it,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) cried, <div class="bookquote">``I don't care! I don't care!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) stood panting a moment longer, and then cried out again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, it isn't true!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) said. ``It CAN<div class="bookquote">``T be true! But oh, how true it
seems!''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>The blazing fire drew her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) to it, and she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) knelt down and held out her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)
hands close to it--so close that the heat made her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) start back.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A fire I only dreamed wouldn't be HOT,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) cried.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) sprang up, touched the table, the dishes, the rug; she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) went to the
bed and touched the blankets. She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) took up the soft wadded
dressing-gown, and suddenly clutched it to her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) breast and held it to
her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) cheek.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's warm. It's soft!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) almost sobbed. <div class="bookquote">``It's real. It must be!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) threw it over her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) shoulders, and put her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) feet into the slippers.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They are real, too. It's all real!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) cried. <div class="bookquote">``I am NOT--I am NOT
dreaming!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) almost staggered to the books and opened the one which lay upon the
top. Something was written on the flyleaf--just a few words, and they
were these:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``To the little girl in the attic. From a friend.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) saw that--wasn't it a strange thing for her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) to do--she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) put her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)
face down upon the page and burst into tears.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know who it is,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``but somebody cares for me a
little. I have a friend.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) took her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) candle and stole out of her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) own room and into Becky's, and
stood by her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) bedside.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Becky, Becky!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) whispered as loudly as she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) dared. <div class="bookquote">``Wake up!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Becky</b></font>)</div><p/>When Becky wakened, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) sat upright staring aghast, her (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) face still
smudged with traces of tears, beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) stood a little figure in a
luxurious wadded robe of crimson silk. The face she (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) saw was a shining,
wonderful thing. The Princess Sara--as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) remembered her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>)--stood at
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) very bedside, holding a candle in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, Becky, come!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Becky</b></font>)</div><p/>Becky was too frightened to speak. She (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) simply got up and followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>),
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) mouth and eyes open, and without a word.

<p/>And when they crossed the threshold, Sara shut the door gently and drew
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) into the warm, glowing midst of things which made her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) brain reel
and her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) hungry senses faint. <div class="bookquote">``It's true! It's true!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) cried.
<div class="bookquote">``I've touched them all. They are as real as we are. The Magic has come
and done it, Becky, while we were asleep--the Magic that won't let
those worst things EVER quite happen.''



 (<font color='red'><b>The Visitor</b></font>)</div><p/>16

<p/>The Visitor


<p/>Imagine, if you can, what the rest of the evening was like. How they
crouched by the fire which blazed and leaped and made so much of itself
in the little grate. How they removed the covers of the dishes, and
found rich, hot, savory soup, which was a meal in itself, and
sandwiches and toast and muffins enough for both of them. The mug from
the washstand was used as Becky's tea cup, and the tea was so delicious
that it was not necessary to pretend that it was anything but tea.
They were warm and full-fed and happy, and it was just like Sara that,
having found her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) strange good fortune real, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) should give herself up
to the enjoyment of it to the utmost. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) had lived such a life of
imaginings that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) was quite equal to accepting any wonderful thing
that happened, and almost to cease, in a short time, to find it
bewildering.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know anyone in the world who could have done it,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) said;
<div class="bookquote">``but there has been someone. And here we are sitting by their
fire--and--and--it's true! And whoever it is--wherever they are--I
have a friend, Becky--someone is my friend.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>It cannot be denied that as they sat before the blazing fire, and ate
the nourishing, comfortable food, they felt a kind of rapturous awe,
and looked into each other's eyes with something like doubt.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you think,''  (<font color='red'><b>Becky</b></font>)</div>Becky faltered once, in a whisper, <div class="bookquote">``do you think it
could melt away, miss? Hadn't we better be quick?''  (<font color='red'><b>Becky</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) hastily
crammed her (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) sandwich into her (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) mouth. If it was only a dream, kitchen
manners would be overlooked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, it won't melt away,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>said Sara. <div class="bookquote">``I am EATING this muffin, and I
can taste it. You never really eat things in dreams. You only think
you are going to eat them. Besides, I keep giving myself pinches; and
I touched a hot piece of coal just now, on purpose.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The sleepy comfort which at length almost overpowered them was a
heavenly thing. It was the drowsiness of happy, well-fed childhood,
and they sat in the fire glow and luxuriated in it until Sara found
herself turning to look at her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) transformed bed.

<p/>There were even blankets enough to share with Becky. The narrow couch
in the next attic was more comfortable that night than its occupant had
ever dreamed that it could be.

<p/>As she (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) went out of the room, Becky turned upon the threshold and looked
about her (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) with devouring eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If it ain't here in the mornin', miss,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``it's been here
tonight, anyways, an' I shan't never forget it.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) looked at each
particular thing, as if to commit it to memory. <div class="bookquote">``The fire was THERE'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>,
pointing with her (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) finger, <div class="bookquote">``an' the table was before it; an' the lamp
was there, an' the light looked rosy red; an' there was a satin cover
on your bed, an' a warm rug on the floor, an' everythin' looked
beautiful; an''' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--she (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) paused a second, and laid her (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) hand on her (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) stomach
tenderly--<div class="bookquote">``there WAS soup an' sandwiches an' muffins--there WAS.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And,
with this conviction a reality at least, she (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) went away.

<p/>Through the mysterious agency which works in schools and among
servants, it was quite well known in the morning that Sara Crewe was in
horrible disgrace, that Ermengarde was under punishment, and that Becky
would have been packed out of the house before breakfast, but that a
scullery maid could not be dispensed with at once. The servants knew
that she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) was allowed to stay because Miss Minchin could not easily find
another creature helpless and humble enough to work like a bounden
slave for so few shillings a week. The elder girls in the schoolroom
knew that if Miss Minchin did not send Sara away it was for practical
reasons of her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) own.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)'s growing so fast and learning such a lot, somehow,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jessie</b></font>)</div>said Jessie
to Lavinia, <div class="bookquote">``that she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) will be given classes soon, and Miss Minchin
knows she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) will have to work for nothing. It was rather nasty of you,
Lavvy, to tell about her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) having fun in the garret. How did you find it
out?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lavinia/Lavinia Herbert</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I got it out of Lottie. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lottie</b></font>)'s such a baby she (<font color='blue'><b>Lottie</b></font>) didn't know she (<font color='blue'><b>Lottie</b></font>) was
telling me. There was nothing nasty at all in speaking to Miss
Minchin. I felt it my duty'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--priggishly. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) was being deceitful.
And it's ridiculous that she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) should look so grand, and be made so much
of, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) rags and tatters!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What were they doing when Miss Minchin caught them?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pretending some silly thing. Ermengarde had taken up her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) hamper to
share with Sara and Becky. She (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) never invites us to share things. Not
that I care, but it's rather vulgar of her (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) to share with servant girls
in attics. I wonder Miss Minchin didn't turn Sara out--even if she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>)
does want her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) for a teacher.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) was turned out where would she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) go?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jessie</b></font>)</div>inquired Jessie, a trifle
anxiously.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How do I know?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lavinia/Lavinia Herbert</b></font>)</div>snapped Lavinia. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>)'ll look rather queer when she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>)
comes into the schoolroom this morning, I should think--after what's
happened. She (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) had no dinner yesterday, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>)'s not to have any
today.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jessie</b></font>)</div><p/>Jessie was not as ill-natured as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jessie</b></font>) was silly. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jessie</b></font>) picked up her (<font color='blue'><b>Jessie</b></font>) book
with a little jerk.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I think it's horrid,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Jessie</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``They've no right to starve her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>)
to death.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div><p/>When Sara went into the kitchen that morning the cook looked askance at
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>), and so did the housemaids; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) passed them hurriedly. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) had,
in fact, overslept herself a little, and as Becky had done the same,
neither had had time to see the other, and each had come downstairs in
haste.

<p/>Sara went into the scullery. Becky was violently scrubbing a kettle,
and was actually gurgling a little song in her (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) throat. She (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) looked up
with a wildly elated face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It was there when I wakened, miss--the blanket,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) whispered
excitedly. <div class="bookquote">``It was as real as it was last night.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So was mine,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>said Sara. <div class="bookquote">``It is all there now--all of it. While I
was dressing I ate some of the cold things we left.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, laws! Oh, laws!''  (<font color='red'><b>Becky</b></font>)</div>Becky uttered the exclamation in a sort of
rapturous groan, and ducked her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) head over her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) kettle just in time, as
the cook came in from the kitchen.

<p/>Miss Minchin had expected to see in Sara, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) appeared in the
schoolroom, very much what Lavinia had expected to see. Sara had always
been an annoying puzzle to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>), because severity never made her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) cry or
look frightened. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) was scolded she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) stood still and listened
politely with a grave face; when she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) was punished she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) performed her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>)
extra tasks or went without her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) meals, making no complaint or outward
sign of rebellion. The very fact that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) never made an impudent
answer seemed to Miss Minchin a kind of impudence in itself. But after
yesterday's deprivation of meals, the violent scene of last night, the
prospect of hunger today, she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) must surely have broken down. It would
be strange indeed if she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) did not come downstairs with pale cheeks and
red eyes and an unhappy, humbled face.

<p/>Miss Minchin saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) for the first time when she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) entered the schoolroom
to hear the little French class recite its lessons and superintend its
exercises. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) came in with a springing step, color in her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) cheeks,
and a smile hovering about the corners of her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) mouth. It was the most
astonishing thing Miss Minchin had ever known. It gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) quite a
shock. What was the child made of? What could such a thing mean? She (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>)
called her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) at once to her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) desk.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You do not look as if you realize that you are in disgrace,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) said.
<div class="bookquote">``Are you absolutely hardened?''

 (<font color='red'><b>a child</b></font>)</div><p/>The truth is that when one is still a child--or even if one is grown
up--and has been well fed, and has slept long and softly and warm; when
one has gone to sleep in the midst of a fairy story, and has wakened to
find it real, one cannot be unhappy or even look as if one were; and
one could not, if one tried, keep a glow of joy out of one's eyes. Miss
Minchin was almost struck dumb by the look of Sara's eyes when she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) made
her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) perfectly respectful answer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I beg your pardon, Miss Minchin,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``I know that I am in
disgrace.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Be good enough not to forget it and look as if you had come into a
fortune. It is an impertinence. And remember you are to have no food
today.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Miss Minchin,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>Sara answered; but as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) turned away her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) heart
leaped with the memory of what yesterday had been. <div class="bookquote">``If the Magic had
not saved me just in time,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) thought, <div class="bookquote">``how horrible it would have
been!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) can't be very hungry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lavinia/Lavinia Herbert</b></font>)</div>whispered Lavinia. <div class="bookquote">``Just look at her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>).
Perhaps she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) is pretending she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) has had a good breakfast'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--with a
spiteful laugh.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>)'s different from other people,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jessie</b></font>)</div>said Jessie, watching Sara with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Jessie</b></font>) class. <div class="bookquote">``Sometimes I'm a bit frightened of her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ridiculous thing!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lavinia/Lavinia Herbert</b></font>)</div>ejaculated Lavinia.

<p/>All through the day the light was in Sara's face, and the color in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>)
cheek. The servants cast puzzled glances at her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>), and whispered to each
other, and Miss Amelia's small blue eyes wore an expression of
bewilderment. What such an audacious look of well-being, under august
displeasure could mean she (<font color='blue'><b>Amelia</b></font>) could not understand. It was, however, just
like Sara's singular obstinate way. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) was probably determined to
brave the matter out.

<p/>One thing Sara had resolved upon, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) thought things over. The
wonders which had happened must be kept a secret, if such a thing were
possible. If Miss Minchin should choose to mount to the attic again,
of course all would be discovered. But it did not seem likely that she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>)
would do so for some time at least, unless she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) was led by suspicion.
Ermengarde and Lottie would be watched with such strictness that they
would not dare to steal out of their beds again. Ermengarde could be
told the story and trusted to keep it secret. If Lottie made any
discoveries, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lottie</b></font>) could be bound to secrecy also. Perhaps the Magic
itself would help to hide its own marvels.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But whatever happens,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>Sara kept saying to herself all day--<div class="bookquote">``WHATEVER
happens, somewhere in the world there is a heavenly kind person who is
my friend--my friend. If I never know who it is--if I never can even
thank him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)--I shall never feel quite so lonely. Oh, the Magic was GOOD
to me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div><p/>If it was possible for weather to be worse than it had been the day
before, it was worse this day--wetter, muddier, colder. There were
more errands to be done, the cook was more irritable, and, knowing that
Sara was in disgrace, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) was more savage. But what does anything
matter when one's Magic has just proved itself one's friend. Sara's
supper of the night before had given her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) strength, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) knew that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>)
should sleep well and warmly, and, even though she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) had naturally begun
to be hungry again before evening, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) could bear it
until breakfast-time on the following day, when her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) meals would surely
be given to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) again. It was quite late when she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) was at last allowed
to go upstairs. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) had been told to go into the schoolroom and study
until ten o'clock, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) had become interested in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) work, and
remained over her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) books later.

<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) reached the top flight of stairs and stood before the attic
door, it must be confessed that her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) heart beat rather fast.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course it MIGHT all have been taken away,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) whispered, trying to
be brave. <div class="bookquote">``It might only have been lent to me for just that one awful
night. But it WAS lent to me--I had it. It was real.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) pushed the door open and went in. Once inside, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) gasped
slightly, shut the door, and stood with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) back against it looking
from side to side.

<p/>The Magic had been there again. It actually had, and it had done even
more than before. The fire was blazing, in lovely leaping flames, more
merrily than ever. A number of new things had been brought into the
attic which so altered the look of it that if she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) had not been past
doubting she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) would have rubbed her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) eyes. Upon the low table another
supper stood--this time with cups and plates for Becky as well as
herself; a piece of bright, heavy, strange embroidery covered the
battered mantel, and on it some ornaments had been placed. All the
bare, ugly things which could be covered with draperies had been
concealed and made to look quite pretty. Some odd materials of rich
colors had been fastened against the wall with fine, sharp tacks--so
sharp that they could be pressed into the wood and plaster without
hammering. Some brilliant fans were pinned up, and there were several
large cushions, big and substantial enough to use as seats. A wooden
box was covered with a rug, and some cushions lay on it, so that it
wore quite the air of a sofa.

<p/>Sara slowly moved away from the door and simply sat down and looked and
looked again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is exactly like something fairy come true,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``There isn't
the least difference. I feel as if I might wish for anything--diamonds
or bags of gold--and they would appear! THAT wouldn't be any stranger
than this. Is this my garret? Am I the same cold, ragged, damp Sara?
And to think I used to pretend and pretend and wish there were fairies!
The one thing I always wanted was to see a fairy story come true. I am
LIVING in a fairy story. I feel as if I might be a fairy myself, and
able to turn things into anything else.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) rose and knocked upon the wall for the prisoner in the next cell,
and the prisoner came.

<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) entered she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) almost dropped in a heap upon the floor. For a
few seconds she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) quite lost her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) breath.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, laws!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) gasped. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, laws, miss!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You see,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>said Sara.

<p/>On this night Becky sat on a cushion upon the hearth rug and had a cup
and saucer of her (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) own.

<p/>When Sara went to bed she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) found that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) had a new thick mattress and
big downy pillows. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) old mattress and pillow had been removed to
Becky's bedstead, and, consequently, with these additions Becky had
been supplied with unheard-of comfort.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where does it all come from?''  (<font color='red'><b>Becky</b></font>)</div>Becky broke forth once. <div class="bookquote">``Laws, who does
it, miss?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't let us even ASK,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>said Sara. ``If it were not that I want to
say, ``Oh, thank you,<div class="bookquote">'' I would rather not know. It makes it more
beautiful.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>From that time life became more wonderful day by day. The fairy story
continued. Almost every day something new was done. Some new comfort
or ornament appeared each time Sara opened the door at night, until in
a short time the attic was a beautiful little room full of all sorts of
odd and luxurious things. The ugly walls were gradually entirely
covered with pictures and draperies, ingenious pieces of folding
furniture appeared, a bookshelf was hung up and filled with books, new
comforts and conveniences appeared one by one, until there seemed
nothing left to be desired. When Sara went downstairs in the morning,
the remains of the supper were on the table; and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) returned to
the attic in the evening, the magician had removed them and left
another nice little meal. Miss Minchin was as harsh and insulting as
ever, Miss Amelia as peevish, and the servants were as vulgar and rude.
Sara was sent on errands in all weathers, and scolded and driven hither
and thither; she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) was scarcely allowed to speak to Ermengarde and
Lottie; Lavinia sneered at the increasing shabbiness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lavinia</b></font>) clothes;
and the other girls stared curiously at her (<font color='blue'><b>Lavinia</b></font>) when she (<font color='blue'><b>Lavinia</b></font>) appeared in the
schoolroom. But what did it all matter while she (<font color='blue'><b>Lavinia</b></font>) was living in this
wonderful mysterious story? It was more romantic and delightful than
anything she (<font color='blue'><b>Lavinia</b></font>) had ever invented to comfort her (<font color='blue'><b>Lavinia</b></font>) starved young soul and
save herself from despair. Sometimes, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Lavinia</b></font>) was scolded, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lavinia</b></font>) could
scarcely keep from smiling.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you only knew!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Lavinia</b></font>) was saying to herself. <div class="bookquote">``If you only knew!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>The comfort and happiness she (<font color='blue'><b>Lavinia</b></font>) enjoyed were making her (<font color='blue'><b>Lavinia</b></font>) stronger, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Lavinia</b></font>)
had them always to look forward to. If she (<font color='blue'><b>Lavinia</b></font>) came home from her (<font color='blue'><b>Lavinia</b></font>) errands
wet and tired and hungry, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lavinia</b></font>) knew she (<font color='blue'><b>Lavinia</b></font>) would soon be warm and well fed
after she (<font color='blue'><b>Lavinia</b></font>) had climbed the stairs. During the hardest day she (<font color='blue'><b>Lavinia</b></font>) could
occupy herself blissfully by thinking of what she (<font color='blue'><b>Lavinia</b></font>) should see when she (<font color='blue'><b>Lavinia</b></font>)
opened the attic door, and wondering what new delight had been prepared
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Lavinia</b></font>). In a very short time she (<font color='blue'><b>Lavinia</b></font>) began to look less thin. Color came
into her (<font color='blue'><b>Lavinia</b></font>) cheeks, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Lavinia</b></font>) eyes did not seem so much too big for her (<font color='blue'><b>Lavinia</b></font>) face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sara Crewe looks wonderfully well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Minchin/MISS MINCHIN</b></font>)</div>Miss Minchin remarked
disapprovingly to her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) sister.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Amelia/Amelia</b></font>)</div>answered poor, silly Miss Amelia. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Crewe</b></font>) is absolutely fattening.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Crewe</b></font>) was beginning to look like a little starved crow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Starved!''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Minchin/MISS MINCHIN</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Miss Minchin, angrily. <div class="bookquote">``There was no reason why
she (<font color='blue'><b>Crewe</b></font>) should look starved. She (<font color='blue'><b>Crewe</b></font>) always had plenty to eat!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of--of course,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Amelia/Amelia</b></font>)</div>agreed Miss Amelia, humbly, alarmed to find that she (<font color='blue'><b>Amelia</b></font>)
had, as usual, said the wrong thing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There is something very disagreeable in seeing that sort of thing in a
child of her (<font color='blue'><b>Crewe</b></font>) age,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Minchin/MISS MINCHIN</b></font>)</div>said Miss Minchin, with haughty vagueness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What--sort of thing?''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Amelia/Amelia</b></font>)</div>Miss Amelia ventured.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It might almost be called defiance,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Minchin/MISS MINCHIN</b></font>)</div>answered Miss Minchin, feeling
annoyed because she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) knew the thing she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) resented was nothing like
defiance, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) did not know what other unpleasant term to use. <div class="bookquote">``The
spirit and will of any other child would have been entirely humbled and
broken by--by the changes she (<font color='blue'><b>Crewe</b></font>) has had to submit to. But, upon my word,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Crewe</b></font>) seems as little subdued as if--as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Crewe</b></font>) were a princess.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you remember,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Amelia/Amelia</b></font>)</div>put in the unwise Miss Amelia, <div class="bookquote">``what she (<font color='blue'><b>Crewe</b></font>) said to you
that day in the schoolroom about what you would do if you found out
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Crewe</b></font>) was--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Amelia/Amelia</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I don't,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Amelia/Amelia</b></font>)</div>said Miss Minchin. <div class="bookquote">``Don't talk nonsense.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>)
remembered very clearly indeed.

<p/>Very naturally, even Becky was beginning to look plumper and less
frightened. She (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) could not help it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) had her (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) share in the secret
fairy story, too. She (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) had two mattresses, two pillows, plenty of
bed-covering, and every night a hot supper and a seat on the cushions
by the fire. The Bastille had melted away, the prisoners no longer
existed. Two comforted children sat in the midst of delights.
Sometimes Sara read aloud from her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) books, sometimes she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) learned her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) own
lessons, sometimes she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) sat and looked into the fire and tried to
imagine who her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) friend could be, and wished she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) could say to him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) some
of the things in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) heart.

<p/>Then it came about that another wonderful thing happened. A man came to
the door and left several parcels. All were addressed in large
letters, <div class="bookquote">``To the Little Girl in the right-hand attic.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div><p/>Sara herself was sent to open the door and take them in. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) laid the
two largest parcels on the hall table, and was looking at the address,
when Miss Minchin came down the stairs and saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Take the things to the young lady to whom they belong,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) said
severely. ``Don't stand there staring at them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They belong to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>answered Sara, quietly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``To you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Minchin/MISS MINCHIN</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Miss Minchin. <div class="bookquote">``What do you mean?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know where they come from,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>said Sara, <div class="bookquote">``but they are addressed
to me. I sleep in the right-hand attic. Becky has the other one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Minchin came to her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) side and looked at the parcels with an excited
expression.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is in them?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) demanded.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>replied Sara.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Open them,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) ordered.

<p/>Sara did as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) was told. When the packages were unfolded Miss
Minchin's countenance wore suddenly a singular expression. What she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>)
saw was pretty and comfortable clothing--clothing of different kinds:
shoes, stockings, and gloves, and a warm and beautiful coat. There were
even a nice hat and an umbrella. They were all good and expensive
things, and on the pocket of the coat was pinned a paper, on which were
written these words: <div class="bookquote">``To be worn every day. Will be replaced by others
when necessary.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Minchin/MISS MINCHIN</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Minchin was quite agitated. This was an incident which suggested
strange things to her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) sordid mind. Could it be that she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) had made a
mistake, after all, and that the neglected child had some powerful
though eccentric friend in the background--perhaps some previously
unknown relation, who had suddenly traced her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) whereabouts, and chose to
provide for her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) in this mysterious and fantastic way? Relations were
sometimes very odd--particularly rich old bachelor uncles, who did not
care for having children near them. A man of that sort might prefer to
overlook his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) young relation's welfare at a distance. Such a person,
however, would be sure to be crotchety and hot-tempered enough to be
easily offended. It would not be very pleasant if there were such a
one, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) should learn all the truth about the thin, shabby clothes,
the scant food, and the hard work. She (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) felt very queer indeed, and
very uncertain, and she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) gave a side glance at Sara.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) said, in a voice such as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) had never used since the
little girl lost her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) father, <div class="bookquote">``someone is very kind to you. As the
things have been sent, and you are to have new ones when they are worn
out, you may as well go and put them on and look respectable. After you
are dressed you may come downstairs and learn your lessons in the
schoolroom. You need not go out on any more errands today.''

 (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div><p/>About half an hour afterward, when the schoolroom door opened and Sara
walked in, the entire seminary was struck dumb.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My word!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jessie</b></font>)</div>ejaculated Jessie, jogging Lavinia's elbow. <div class="bookquote">``Look at the
Princess Sara!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Everybody</b></font>)</div><p/>Everybody was looking, and when Lavinia looked she (<font color='blue'><b>Lavinia</b></font>) turned quite red.

<p/>It was the Princess Sara indeed. At least, since the days when she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) had
been a princess, Sara had never looked as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) did now. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) did not
seem the Sara they had seen come down the back stairs a few hours ago.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) was dressed in the kind of frock Lavinia had been used to envying
her (<font color='blue'><b>Lavinia</b></font>) the possession of. It was deep and warm in color, and beautifully
made. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Lavinia</b></font>) slender feet looked as they had done when Jessie had admired
them, and the hair, whose heavy locks had made her (<font color='blue'><b>Jessie</b></font>) look rather like a
Shetland pony when it fell loose about her (<font color='blue'><b>Jessie</b></font>) small, odd face, was tied
back with a ribbon.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps someone has left her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) a fortune,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jessie</b></font>)</div>Jessie whispered. <div class="bookquote">``I always
thought something would happen to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>)'s so queer.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps the diamond mines have suddenly appeared again,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lavinia/Lavinia Herbert</b></font>)</div>said Lavinia,
scathingly. <div class="bookquote">``Don't please her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) by staring at her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) in that way, you silly
thing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sara,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Minchin/MISS MINCHIN</b></font>)</div>broke in Miss Minchin's deep voice, <div class="bookquote">``come and sit here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Minchin/MISS MINCHIN</b></font>)</div><p/>And while the whole schoolroom stared and pushed with elbows, and
scarcely made any effort to conceal its excited curiosity, Sara went to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) old seat of honor, and bent her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) head over her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) books.

<p/>That night, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) went to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) room, after she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) and Becky had eaten
their supper she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) sat and looked at the fire seriously for a long time.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you making something up in your head, miss?''  (<font color='red'><b>Becky</b></font>)</div>Becky inquired with
respectful softness. When Sara sat in silence and looked into the
coals with dreaming eyes it generally meant that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) was making a new
story. But this time she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) was not, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) head.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) answered. <div class="bookquote">``I am wondering what I ought to do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Becky</b></font>)</div><p/>Becky stared--still respectfully. She (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) was filled with something
approaching reverence for everything Sara did and said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't help thinking about my friend,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>Sara explained. <div class="bookquote">``If he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) wants
to keep himself a secret, it would be rude to try and find out who he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)
is. But I do so want him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) to know how thankful I am to him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)--and how
happy he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) has made me. Anyone who is kind wants to know when people
have been made happy. They care for that more than for being thanked.
I wish--I do wish--''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) stopped short because her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) eyes at that instant fell upon something
standing on a table in a corner. It was something she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) had found in the
room when she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) came up to it only two days before. It was a little
writing-case fitted with paper and envelopes and pens and ink.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) exclaimed, <div class="bookquote">``why did I not think of that before?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) rose and went to the corner and brought the case back to the fire.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can write to him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) said joyfully, <div class="bookquote">``and leave it on the table.
Then perhaps the person who takes the things away will take it, too. I
won't ask him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) anything. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) won't mind my thanking him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>), I feel sure.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>So she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) wrote a note. This is what she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) said:


<p/>I hope you will not think it is impolite that I should write this note
to you when you wish to keep yourself a secret. Please believe I do
not mean to be impolite or try to find out anything at all; only I want
to thank you for being so kind to me--so heavenly kind--and making
everything like a fairy story. I am so grateful to you, and I am so
happy--and so is Becky. Becky feels just as thankful as I do--it is
all just as beautiful and wonderful to her (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) as it is to me. We used to
be so lonely and cold and hungry, and now--oh, just think what you have
done for us! Please let me say just these words. It seems as if I
OUGHT to say them. THANK you--THANK you--THANK you!

<p/>THE LITTLE GIRL IN THE ATTIC.


<p/>The next morning she (<font color='blue'><b>GIRL</b></font>) left this on the little table, and in the evening
it had been taken away with the other things; so she (<font color='blue'><b>GIRL</b></font>) knew the Magician
had received it, and she (<font color='blue'><b>GIRL</b></font>) was happier for the thought. She (<font color='blue'><b>GIRL</b></font>) was reading
one of her (<font color='blue'><b>GIRL</b></font>) new books to Becky just before they went to their respective
beds, when her (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) attention was attracted by a sound at the skylight.
When she (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) looked up from her (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) page she (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) saw that Becky had heard the sound
also, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) had turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) head to look and was listening rather
nervously.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Something's there, miss,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) whispered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>said Sara, slowly. <div class="bookquote">``It sounds--rather like a cat--trying to get
in.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) left her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) chair and went to the skylight. It was a queer little
sound she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) heard--like a soft scratching. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) suddenly remembered
something and laughed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) remembered a quaint little intruder who had
made his (<font color='blue'><b>intruder</b></font>) way into the attic once before. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) had seen him (<font color='blue'><b>intruder</b></font>) that very
afternoon, sitting disconsolately on a table before a window in the
Indian gentleman's house.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Suppose,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) whispered in pleased excitement--<div class="bookquote">``just suppose it was
the monkey who got away again. Oh, I wish it was!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) climbed on a chair, very cautiously raised the skylight, and peeped
out. It had been snowing all day, and on the snow, quite near her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>),
crouched a tiny, shivering figure, whose small black face wrinkled
itself piteously at sight of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is the monkey,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) cried out. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>monkey</b></font>) has crept out of the Lascar's
attic, and he (<font color='blue'><b>monkey</b></font>) saw the light.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Becky</b></font>)</div><p/>Becky ran to her (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) side.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you going to let him (<font color='blue'><b>monkey</b></font>) in, miss?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>Sara answered joyfully. <div class="bookquote">``It's too cold for monkeys to be out.
They're delicate. I'll coax him (<font color='blue'><b>monkey</b></font>) in.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) put a hand out delicately, speaking in a coaxing voice--as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>)
spoke to the sparrows and to Melchisedec--as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) were some friendly
little animal herself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come along, monkey darling,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I won't hurt you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) knew she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) would not hurt him (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) knew it before she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) laid her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) soft,
caressing little paw on him (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) and drew him (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) had felt human
love in the slim brown hands of Ram Dass, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) felt it in hers. He (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>)
let her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) lift him (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) through the skylight, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) found himself in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>)
arms he (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) cuddled up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) breast and looked up into her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nice monkey! Nice monkey!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) crooned, kissing his (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) funny head. <div class="bookquote">``Oh,
I do love little animal things.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) was evidently glad to get to the fire, and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) sat down and
held him (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) on her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) knee he (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) looked from her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) to Becky with mingled interest
and appreciation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>monkey</b></font>) IS plain-looking, miss, ain't he (<font color='blue'><b>monkey</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Becky</b></font>)</div>said Becky.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>monkey</b></font>) looks like a very ugly baby,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>laughed Sara. ``I beg your pardon,
monkey; but I'm glad you are not a baby. Your mother COULDN<div class="bookquote">``T be proud
of you, and no one would dare to say you looked like any of your
relations. Oh, I do like you!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) leaned back in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) chair and reflected.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>monkey</b></font>)'s sorry he (<font color='blue'><b>monkey</b></font>)'s so ugly,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``and it's always on his (<font color='blue'><b>monkey</b></font>)
mind. I wonder if he (<font color='blue'><b>monkey</b></font>) HAS a mind. Monkey, my love, have you a mind?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>But the monkey only put up a tiny paw and scratched his (<font color='blue'><b>monkey</b></font>) head.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What shall you do with him (<font color='blue'><b>monkey</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Becky</b></font>)</div>Becky asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall let him (<font color='blue'><b>monkey</b></font>) sleep with me tonight, and then take him (<font color='blue'><b>monkey</b></font>) back to the
Indian gentleman tomorrow. I am sorry to take you back, monkey; but
you must go. You ought to be fondest of your own family; and I'm not a
REAL relation.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>And when she (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) went to bed she (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) made him (<font color='blue'><b>monkey</b></font>) a nest at her (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) feet, and he (<font color='blue'><b>monkey</b></font>) curled
up and slept there as if he (<font color='blue'><b>monkey</b></font>) were a baby and much pleased with his (<font color='blue'><b>monkey</b></font>)
quarters.



<p/>17

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It Is the Child!''


 (<font color='red'><b>members</b></font>)</div><p/>The next afternoon three members of the Large Family sat in the Indian
gentleman's library, doing their best to cheer him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) up. They had been
allowed to come in to perform this office because he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had specially
invited them. He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had been living in a state of suspense for some time,
and today he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was waiting for a certain event very anxiously. This
event was the return of Mr. Carmichael from Moscow. His (<font color='blue'><b>Carmichael</b></font>) stay there had
been prolonged from week to week. On his (<font color='blue'><b>Carmichael</b></font>) first arrival there, he (<font color='blue'><b>Carmichael</b></font>) had
not been able satisfactorily to trace the family he (<font color='blue'><b>Carmichael</b></font>) had gone in search
of. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Carmichael</b></font>) felt at last sure that he (<font color='blue'><b>Carmichael</b></font>) had found them and had gone to
their house, he (<font color='blue'><b>Carmichael</b></font>) had been told that they were absent on a journey. His (<font color='blue'><b>Carmichael</b></font>)
efforts to reach them had been unavailing, so he (<font color='blue'><b>Carmichael</b></font>) had decided to remain
in Moscow until their return. Mr. Carrisford sat in his (<font color='blue'><b>Carrisford</b></font>) reclining
chair, and Janet sat on the floor beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Carrisford</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Carrisford</b></font>) was very fond of
Janet. Nora had found a footstool, and Donald was astride the tiger's
head which ornamented the rug made of the animal's skin. It must be
owned that he (<font color='blue'><b>Donald</b></font>) was riding it rather violently.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't chirrup so loud, Donald,''  (<font color='red'><b>Janet</b></font>)</div>Janet said. <div class="bookquote">``When you come to cheer
an ill person up you don't cheer him (<font color='blue'><b>Donald</b></font>) up at the top of your voice.
Perhaps cheering up is too loud, Mr. Carrisford?''  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>turning to the Indian
gentleman.

<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) only patted her (<font color='blue'><b>Janet</b></font>) shoulder.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, it isn't,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) answered. <div class="bookquote">``And it keeps me from thinking too much.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm going to be quiet,''  (<font color='red'><b>Donald</b></font>)</div>Donald shouted. <div class="bookquote">``We'll all be as quiet as
mice.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mice don't make a noise like that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Janet</b></font>)</div>said Janet.

<p/>Donald made a bridle of his (<font color='blue'><b>Donald</b></font>) handkerchief and bounced up and down on the
tiger's head.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A whole lot of mice might,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Donald</b></font>) said cheerfully. <div class="bookquote">``A thousand mice
might.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't believe fifty thousand mice would,''  (<font color='red'><b>Janet</b></font>)</div>said Janet, severely; <div class="bookquote">``and
we have to be as quiet as one mouse.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Janet</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Carrisford laughed and patted her (<font color='blue'><b>Janet</b></font>) shoulder again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Papa won't be very long now,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Janet</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``May we talk about the lost
little girl?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think I could talk much about anything else just now,''  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>the
Indian gentleman answered, knitting his (<font color='blue'><b>Carrisford</b></font>) forehead with a tired look.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We like her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) so much,''  (<font color='red'><b>Nora</b></font>)</div>said Nora. <div class="bookquote">``We call her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) the little un-fairy
princess.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why?''  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>the Indian gentleman inquired, because the fancies of the Large
Family always made him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) forget things a little.

<p/>It was Janet who answered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is because, though she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) is not exactly a fairy, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) will be so rich
when she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) is found that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) will be like a princess in a fairy tale. We
called her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) the fairy princess at first, but it didn't quite suit.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it true,''  (<font color='red'><b>Nora</b></font>)</div>said Nora, <div class="bookquote">``that her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) papa gave all his (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) money to a friend
to put in a mine that had diamonds in it, and then the friend thought
he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had lost it all and ran away because he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) felt as if he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) was a robber?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Nora</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) wasn't really, you know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Janet</b></font>)</div>put in Janet, hastily.

<p/>The Indian gentleman took hold of her (<font color='blue'><b>Janet</b></font>) hand quickly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) wasn't really,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sorry for the friend,''  (<font color='red'><b>Janet</b></font>)</div>Janet said; <div class="bookquote">``I can't help it. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) didn't
mean to do it, and it would break his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) heart. I am sure it would break
his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) heart.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Janet</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are an understanding little woman, Janet,''  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>the Indian gentleman
said, and he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) held her (<font color='blue'><b>Janet</b></font>) hand close.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Did you tell Mr. Carrisford,''  (<font color='red'><b>Donald</b></font>)</div>Donald shouted again, <div class="bookquote">``about the
little-girl-who-isn`t-a-beggar? Did you tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Carrisford</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Janet</b></font>) has new nice
clothes? P`r`aps she (<font color='blue'><b>Janet</b></font>)'s been found by somebody when she (<font color='blue'><b>Janet</b></font>) was lost.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Donald</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There's a cab!''  (<font color='red'><b>Janet</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Janet. <div class="bookquote">``It's stopping before the door. It
is papa!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They all ran to the windows to look out.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, it's papa,''  (<font color='red'><b>Donald</b></font>)</div>Donald proclaimed. <div class="bookquote">``But there is no little girl.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>All three of them incontinently fled from the room and tumbled into the
hall. It was in this way they always welcomed their father. They were
to be heard jumping up and down, clapping their hands, and being caught
up and kissed.

<p/>Mr. Carrisford made an effort to rise and sank back again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is no use,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Carrisford</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``What a wreck I am!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Carmichael/Carmichael</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Carmichael's voice approached the door.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, children,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Carrisford</b></font>) was saying; <div class="bookquote">``you may come in after I have talked to
Mr. Carrisford. Go and play with Ram Dass.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Then the door opened and he (<font color='blue'><b>Carrisford</b></font>) came in. He (<font color='blue'><b>Carrisford</b></font>) looked rosier than ever, and
brought an atmosphere of freshness and health with him (<font color='blue'><b>Carrisford</b></font>); but his (<font color='blue'><b>Carrisford</b></font>) eyes
were disappointed and anxious as they met the invalid's look of eager
question even as they grasped each other's hands.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What news?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Carrisford/Carrisford</b></font>)</div>Mr. Carrisford asked. <div class="bookquote">``The child the Russian people
adopted?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) is not the child we are looking for,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Carmichael/Carmichael</b></font>)</div>was Mr. Carmichael's answer.
<div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) is much younger than Captain Crewe's little girl. Her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) name is
Emily Carew. I have seen and talked to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). The Russians were able to
give me every detail.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div><p/>How wearied and miserable the Indian gentleman looked! His (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) hand
dropped from Mr. Carmichael's.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then the search has to be begun over again,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Carmichael</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``That is all.
Please sit down.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Carmichael/Carmichael</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Carmichael took a seat. Somehow, he (<font color='blue'><b>Carmichael</b></font>) had gradually grown fond of
this unhappy man. He (<font color='blue'><b>Carmichael</b></font>) was himself so well and happy, and so surrounded
by cheerfulness and love, that desolation and broken health seemed
pitifully unbearable things. If there had been the sound of just one
gay little high-pitched voice in the house, it would have been so much
less forlorn. And that a man should be compelled to carry about in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
breast the thought that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had seemed to wrong and desert a child was
not a thing one could face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, come,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cheery voice; <div class="bookquote">``we'll find her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) yet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We must begin at once. No time must be lost,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Carrisford/Carrisford</b></font>)</div>Mr. Carrisford fretted.
<div class="bookquote">``Have you any new suggestion to make--any whatsoever?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Carmichael/Carmichael</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Carmichael felt rather restless, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Carmichael</b></font>) rose and began to pace the
room with a thoughtful, though uncertain face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, perhaps,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Carmichael</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I don't know what it may be worth. The
fact is, an idea occurred to me as I was thinking the thing over in the
train on the journey from Dover.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What was it? If she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) is alive, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) is somewhere.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) is SOMEWHERE. We have searched the schools in Paris. Let us
give up Paris and begin in London. That was my idea--to search London.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There are schools enough in London,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Carrisford/Carrisford</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Carrisford. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Carrisford</b></font>)
slightly started, roused by a recollection. <div class="bookquote">``By the way, there is one
next door.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then we will begin there. We cannot begin nearer than next door.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Carrisford/Carrisford</b></font>)</div>said Carrisford. <div class="bookquote">``There is a child there who interests me; but
she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) is not a pupil. And she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) is a little dark, forlorn creature, as
unlike poor Crewe as a child could be.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Magic</b></font>)</div><p/>Perhaps the Magic was at work again at that very moment--the beautiful
Magic. It really seemed as if it might be so. What was it that brought
Ram Dass into the room--even as his (<font color='blue'><b>Dass</b></font>) master spoke--salaaming
respectfully, but with a scarcely concealed touch of excitement in his (<font color='blue'><b>Dass</b></font>)
dark, flashing eyes?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sahib,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Dass</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``the child herself has come--the child the sahib felt
pity for. She (<font color='blue'><b>Crewe</b></font>) brings back the monkey who had again run away to her (<font color='blue'><b>Crewe</b></font>)
attic under the roof. I have asked that she (<font color='blue'><b>Crewe</b></font>) remain. It was my thought
that it would please the sahib to see and speak with her (<font color='blue'><b>Crewe</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who is she (<font color='blue'><b>Crewe</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Carmichael/Carmichael</b></font>)</div>inquired Mr. Carmichael.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``God knows,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>Mr. Carrrisford answered. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Crewe</b></font>) is the child I spoke of. A
little drudge at the school.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) waved his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) hand to Ram Dass, and
addressed him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Yes, I should like to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Crewe</b></font>). Go and bring her (<font color='blue'><b>Crewe</b></font>) in.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) turned to Mr. Carmichael. <div class="bookquote">``While you have been away,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Carmichael</b></font>)
explained, <div class="bookquote">``I have been desperate. The days were so dark and long. Ram
Dass told me of this child's miseries, and together we invented a
romantic plan to help her (<font color='blue'><b>Crewe</b></font>). I suppose it was a childish thing to do;
but it gave me something to plan and think of. Without the help of an
agile, soft-footed Oriental like Ram Dass, however, it could not have
been done.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Then Sara came into the room. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) carried the monkey in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) arms, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>monkey</b></font>) evidently did not intend to part from her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>), if it could be helped.
He (<font color='blue'><b>monkey</b></font>) was clinging to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) and chattering, and the interesting excitement
of finding herself in the Indian gentleman's room had brought a flush
to Sara's cheeks.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your monkey ran away again,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) said, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) pretty voice. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>monkey</b></font>) came
to my garret window last night, and I took him (<font color='blue'><b>monkey</b></font>) in because it was so
cold. I would have brought him (<font color='blue'><b>monkey</b></font>) back if it had not been so late. I knew
you were ill and might not like to be disturbed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The gentleman</b></font>)</div><p/>The Indian gentleman's hollow eyes dwelt on her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) with curious interest.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That was very thoughtful of you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) said.

<p/>Sara looked toward Ram Dass, who stood near the door.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Shall I give him (<font color='blue'><b>monkey</b></font>) to the Lascar?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How do you know he (<font color='blue'><b>monkey</b></font>) is a Lascar?''  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>said the Indian gentleman, smiling a
little.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I know Lascars,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>Sara said, handing over the reluctant monkey. <div class="bookquote">``I
was born in India.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The gentleman</b></font>)</div><p/>The Indian gentleman sat upright so suddenly, and with such a change of
expression, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) was for a moment quite startled.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You were born in India,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) exclaimed, <div class="bookquote">``were you? Come here.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
held out his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) hand.

<p/>Sara went to him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) and laid her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) hand in his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>), as he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) seemed to want to take
it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) stood still, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) green-gray eyes met his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) wonderingly.
Something seemed to be the matter with him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You live next door?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) demanded.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; I live at Miss Minchin's seminary.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you are not one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) pupils?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div><p/>A strange little smile hovered about Sara's mouth. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) hesitated a
moment.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think I know exactly WHAT I am,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) replied.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why not?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``At first I was a pupil, and a parlor boarder; but now--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You were a pupil! What are you now?''

 (<font color='red'><b>The queer smile</b></font>)</div><p/>The queer little sad smile was on Sara's lips again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I sleep in the attic, next to the scullery maid,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I run
errands for the cook--I do anything she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) tells me; and I teach the
little ones their lessons.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Question her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>), Carmichael,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Carrisford/Carrisford</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Carrisford, sinking back as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Carrisford</b></font>)
had lost his (<font color='blue'><b>Carrisford</b></font>) strength. <div class="bookquote">``Question her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>); I cannot.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The father</b></font>)</div><p/>The big, kind father of the Large Family knew how to question little
girls. Sara realized how much practice he (<font color='blue'><b>Carrisford</b></font>) had had when he (<font color='blue'><b>Carrisford</b></font>) spoke to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>)
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Carrisford</b></font>) nice, encouraging voice.

<p/>``What do you mean by ``At first,<div class="bookquote">'' my child?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Carrisford</b></font>) inquired.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``When I was first taken there by my papa.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Where is your papa?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) died,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>said Sara, very quietly. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) lost all his (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) money and there
was none left for me. There was no one to take care of me or to pay
Miss Minchin.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Carmichael!''  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>the Indian gentleman cried out loudly. <div class="bookquote">``Carmichael!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We must not frighten her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Carmichael/Carmichael</b></font>)</div>Mr. Carmichael said aside to him (<font color='blue'><b>Carmichael</b></font>) in a
quick, low voice. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Carmichael</b></font>) added aloud to Sara, <div class="bookquote">``So you were sent up
into the attic, and made into a little drudge. That was about it,
wasn't it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There was no one to take care of me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>said Sara. <div class="bookquote">``There was no money;
I belong to nobody.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How did your father lose his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) money?''  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>the Indian gentleman broke in
breathlessly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) did not lose it himself,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>Sara answered, wondering still more each
moment. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had a friend he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was very fond of--he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was very fond of him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>).
It was his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) friend who took his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) money. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) trusted his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) friend too much.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The gentleman</b></font>)</div><p/>The Indian gentleman's breath came more quickly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The friend might have MEANT to do no harm,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``It might have
happened through a mistake.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div><p/>Sara did not know how unrelenting her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) quiet young voice sounded as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>)
answered. If she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) had known, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) would surely have tried to soften it
for the Indian gentleman's sake.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The suffering was just as bad for my papa,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``It killed him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What was your father's name?''  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>the Indian gentleman said. <div class="bookquote">``Tell me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``His (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) name was Ralph Crewe,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>Sara answered, feeling startled. <div class="bookquote">``Captain
Crewe. He (<font color='blue'><b>Crewe</b></font>) died in India.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ram Dass</b></font>)</div><p/>The haggard face contracted, and Ram Dass sprang to his (<font color='blue'><b>Dass</b></font>) master's side.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Carmichael,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>the invalid gasped, <div class="bookquote">``it is the child--the child!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div><p/>For a moment Sara thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Dass</b></font>) was going to die. Ram Dass poured out
drops from a bottle, and held them to his (<font color='blue'><b>Dass</b></font>) lips. Sara stood near,
trembling a little. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) looked in a bewildered way at Mr. Carmichael.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What child am I?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) faltered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Carmichael</b></font>) was your father's friend,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Carmichael/Carmichael</b></font>)</div>Mr. Carmichael answered her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Don't be
frightened. We have been looking for you for two years.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div><p/>Sara put her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) hand up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) forehead, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) mouth trembled. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>)
spoke as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) were in a dream.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And I was at Miss Minchin's all the while,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) half whispered. <div class="bookquote">``Just

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I Tried Not to Be''


 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Carmichael/Carmichael</b></font>)</div><p/>It was pretty, comfortable Mrs. Carmichael who explained everything.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Carmichael</b></font>) was sent for at once, and came across the square to take Sara into
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) warm arms and make clear to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) all that had happened. The
excitement of the totally unexpected discovery had been temporarily
almost overpowering to Mr. Carrisford in his (<font color='blue'><b>Carrisford</b></font>) weak condition.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Upon my word,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Carrisford</b></font>) said faintly to Mr. Carmichael, when it was

minutes.''  (<font color='red'><b>Janet</b></font>)</div>And it was Janet who led her (<font color='blue'><b>Janet</b></font>) away.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We're so glad you are found,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Janet</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``You don't know how glad we
are that you are found.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Donald</b></font>)</div><p/>Donald stood with his (<font color='blue'><b>Donald</b></font>) hands in his (<font color='blue'><b>Donald</b></font>) pockets, and gazed at Sara with
reflecting and self-reproachful eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If I'd just asked what your name was when I gave you my sixpence,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Donald</b></font>)
said, <div class="bookquote">``you would have told me it was Sara Crewe, and then you would
have been found in a minute.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Then Mrs. Carmichael came in. She (<font color='blue'><b>Carmichael</b></font>) looked
very much moved, and suddenly took Sara in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) arms and kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You look bewildered, poor child,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``And it is not to be
wondered at.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div><p/>Sara could only think of one thing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Was he (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) said, with a glance toward the closed door of the
library--<div class="bookquote">``was HE (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) the wicked friend? Oh, do tell me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Carmichael was crying as she (<font color='blue'><b>Carmichael</b></font>) kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Carmichael</b></font>) again. She (<font color='blue'><b>Carmichael</b></font>) felt as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Carmichael</b></font>)
ought to be kissed very often because she (<font color='blue'><b>Carmichael</b></font>) had not been kissed for so
long.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) was not wicked, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Carmichael</b></font>) answered. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) did not really lose
your papa's money. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) only thought he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had lost it; and because he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)
loved him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) so much his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) grief made him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) so ill that for a time he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) was not
in his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) right mind. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) almost died of brain fever, and long before he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)
began to recover your poor papa was dead.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) did not know where to find me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>murmured Sara. <div class="bookquote">``And I was so
near.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Somehow, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) could not forget that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) had been so near.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) believed you were in school in France,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Carmichael/Carmichael</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Carmichael explained.
<div class="bookquote">``And he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) was continually misled by false clues. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) has looked for you
everywhere. When he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) saw you pass by, looking so sad and neglected, he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)
did not dream that you were his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) friend's poor child; but because you
were a little girl, too, he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) was sorry for you, and wanted to make you
happier. And he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) told Ram Dass to climb into your attic window and try
to make you comfortable.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div><p/>Sara gave a start of joy; her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) whole look changed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Did Ram Dass bring the things?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) cried out. <div class="bookquote">``Did he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) tell Ram Dass
to do it? Did he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) make the dream that came true?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, my dear--yes! He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) is kind and good, and he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) was sorry for you, for
little lost Sara Crewe's sake.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Carmichael/Carmichael</b></font>)</div><p/>The library door opened and Mr. Carmichael appeared, calling Sara to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Carmichael</b></font>) with a gesture.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Carrisford is better already,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Carmichael</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Carrisford</b></font>) wants you to come to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Carrisford</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div><p/>Sara did not wait. When the Indian gentleman looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>)
entered, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) saw that her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) face was all alight.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) went and stood before his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) chair, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) hands clasped together
against her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) breast.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You sent the things to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) said, in a joyful emotional little
voice, <div class="bookquote">``the beautiful, beautiful things? YOU sent them!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, poor, dear child, I did,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) answered her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was weak and
broken with long illness and trouble, but he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) with the
look she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) remembered in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) father's eyes--that look of loving her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) and
wanting to take her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) arms. It made her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) kneel down by him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>), just
as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) used to kneel by her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) father when they were the dearest friends
and lovers in the world.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then it is you who are my friend,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``it is you who are my
friend!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) dropped her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) face on his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) thin hand and kissed it again
and again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The man will be himself again in three weeks,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Carmichael/Carmichael</b></font>)</div>Mr. Carmichael said
aside to his (<font color='blue'><b>Carmichael</b></font>) wife. <div class="bookquote">``Look at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face already.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>In fact, he (<font color='blue'><b>Carmichael</b></font>) did look changed. Here was the <div class="bookquote">``Little Missus,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Carmichael</b></font>) had
new things to think of and plan for already. In the first place, there
was Miss Minchin. She (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) must be interviewed and told of the change which
had taken place in the fortunes of her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) pupil.

<p/>Sara was not to return to the seminary at all. The Indian gentleman
was very determined upon that point. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) must remain where she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) was,
and Mr. Carmichael should go and see Miss Minchin himself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am glad I need not go back,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>said Sara. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Missus</b></font>) will be very angry.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Missus</b></font>) does not like me; though perhaps it is my fault, because I do not
like her (<font color='blue'><b>Missus</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Minchin/MISS MINCHIN</b></font>)</div><p/>But, oddly enough, Miss Minchin made it unnecessary for Mr. Carmichael
to go to her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>), by actually coming in search of her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) pupil herself. She (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>)
had wanted Sara for something, and on inquiry had heard an astonishing
thing. One of the housemaids had seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) steal out of the area with
something hidden under her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) cloak, and had also seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) go up the steps
of the next door and enter the house.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What does she (<font color='blue'><b>Missus</b></font>) mean!''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Minchin/MISS MINCHIN</b></font>)</div>cried Miss Minchin to Miss Amelia.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know, I'm sure, sister,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Amelia/Amelia</b></font>)</div>answered Miss Amelia. <div class="bookquote">``Unless she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)
has made friends with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) because he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has lived in India.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It would be just like her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) to thrust herself upon him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and try to gain
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sympathies in some such impertinent fashion,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Minchin/MISS MINCHIN</b></font>)</div>said Miss Minchin.
<div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) must have been in the house for two hours. I will not allow such
presumption. I shall go and inquire into the matter, and apologize for
her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) intrusion.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div><p/>Sara was sitting on a footstool close to Mr. Carrisford's knee, and
listening to some of the many things he (<font color='blue'><b>Carrisford</b></font>) felt it necessary to try to
explain to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>), when Ram Dass announced the visitor's arrival.

<p/>Sara rose involuntarily, and became rather pale; but Mr. Carrisford saw
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) stood quietly, and showed none of the ordinary signs of child
terror.

<p/>Miss Minchin entered the room with a sternly dignified manner. She (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) was
correctly and well dressed, and rigidly polite.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sorry to disturb Mr. Carrisford,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``but I have
explanations to make. I am Miss Minchin, the proprietress of the Young
Ladies' Seminary next door.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>The Indian gentleman looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) for a moment in silent scrutiny. He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
was a man who had naturally a rather hot temper, and he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) did not wish it
to get too much the better of him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So you are Miss Minchin?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In that case,''  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>the Indian gentleman replied, <div class="bookquote">``you have arrived at the
right time. My solicitor, Mr. Carmichael, was just on the point of
going to see you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Carmichael bowed slightly, and Miss Minchin looked from him (<font color='blue'><b>Carmichael</b></font>) to Mr.
Carrisford in amazement.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your solicitor!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I do not understand. I have come here as
a matter of duty. I have just discovered that you have been intruded
upon through the forwardness of one of my pupils--a charity pupil. I
came to explain that she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) intruded without my knowledge.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) turned
upon Sara. <div class="bookquote">``Go home at once,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) commanded indignantly. <div class="bookquote">``You shall be
severely punished. Go home at once.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The gentleman</b></font>)</div><p/>The Indian gentleman drew Sara to his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) side and patted her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) is not going.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Minchin/MISS MINCHIN</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Minchin felt rather as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) must be losing her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) senses.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not going!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) repeated.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Carrisford/Carrisford</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Carrisford. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) is not going home--if you give your
house that name. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) home for the future will be with me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Minchin/MISS MINCHIN</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Minchin fell back in amazed indignation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``With YOU! With YOU sir! What does this mean?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Kindly explain the matter, Carmichael,''  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>said the Indian gentleman;
<div class="bookquote">``and get it over as quickly as possible.''  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) made Sara sit down
again, and held her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) hands in his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)--which was another trick of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) papa's.

<p/>Then Mr. Carmichael explained--in the quiet, level-toned, steady manner
of a man who knew his (<font color='blue'><b>Carmichael</b></font>) subject, and all its legal significance, which
was a thing Miss Minchin understood as a business woman, and did not
enjoy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Carrisford, madam,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Carmichael</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``was an intimate friend of the late
Captain Crewe. He (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) was his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) partner in certain large investments. The
fortune which Captain Crewe supposed he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) had lost has been recovered,
and is now in Mr. Carrisford's hands.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The fortune!''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Minchin/MISS MINCHIN</b></font>)</div>cried Miss Minchin; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) really lost color as she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>)
uttered the exclamation. <div class="bookquote">``Sara's fortune!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It WILL be Sara's fortune,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Carmichael/Carmichael</b></font>)</div>replied Mr. Carmichael, rather coldly. <div class="bookquote">``It
is Sara's fortune now, in fact. Certain events have increased it
enormously. The diamond mines have retrieved themselves.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The diamond mines!''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Minchin/MISS MINCHIN</b></font>)</div>Miss Minchin gasped out. If this was true,
nothing so horrible, she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) felt, had ever happened to her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) since she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) was
born.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The diamond mines,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Carmichael/Carmichael</b></font>)</div>Mr. Carmichael repeated, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Carmichael</b></font>) could not help
adding, with a rather sly, unlawyer-like smile, <div class="bookquote">``There are not many
princesses, Miss Minchin, who are richer than your little charity
pupil, Sara Crewe, will be. Mr. Carrisford has been searching for her (<font color='blue'><b>Crewe</b></font>)
for nearly two years; he (<font color='blue'><b>Carrisford</b></font>) has found her (<font color='blue'><b>Crewe</b></font>) at last, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Carrisford</b></font>) will keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Crewe</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>After which he (<font color='blue'><b>Carmichael</b></font>) asked Miss Minchin to sit down while he (<font color='blue'><b>Carmichael</b></font>) explained
matters to her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) fully, and went into such detail as was necessary to
make it quite clear to her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) that Sara's future was an assured one, and
that what had seemed to be lost was to be restored to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) tenfold;
also, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) had in Mr. Carrisford a guardian as well as a friend.

<p/>Miss Minchin was not a clever woman, and in her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) excitement she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) was
silly enough to make one desperate effort to regain what she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) could not
help seeing she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) had lost through her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) worldly folly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Carrisford</b></font>) found her (<font color='blue'><b>Crewe</b></font>) under my care,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) protested. <div class="bookquote">``I have done everything
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Crewe</b></font>). But for me she (<font color='blue'><b>Crewe</b></font>) should have starved in the streets.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div><p/>Here the Indian gentleman lost his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) temper.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``As to starving in the streets,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>Crewe</b></font>) might have starved more
comfortably there than in your attic.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Captain Crewe left her (<font color='blue'><b>Crewe</b></font>) in my charge,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Minchin/MISS MINCHIN</b></font>)</div>Miss Minchin argued. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Crewe</b></font>) must
return to it until she (<font color='blue'><b>Crewe</b></font>) is of age. She (<font color='blue'><b>Crewe</b></font>) can be a parlor boarder again.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Crewe</b></font>) must finish her (<font color='blue'><b>Crewe</b></font>) education. The law will interfere in my behalf.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, come, Miss Minchin,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Carmichael/Carmichael</b></font>)</div>Mr. Carmichael interposed, <div class="bookquote">``the law will do
nothing of the sort. If Sara herself wishes to return to you, I dare
say Mr. Carrisford might not refuse to allow it. But that rests with
Sara.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Carmichael/Carmichael</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Minchin/MISS MINCHIN</b></font>)</div>said Miss Minchin, <div class="bookquote">``I appeal to Sara. I have not spoiled you,
perhaps,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Minchin/MISS MINCHIN</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) said awkwardly to the little girl; <div class="bookquote">``but you know that
your papa was pleased with your progress. And--ahem--I have always been
fond of you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div><p/>Sara's green-gray eyes fixed themselves on her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) with the quiet, clear
look Miss Minchin particularly disliked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have YOU, Miss Minchin?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I did not know that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Minchin/MISS MINCHIN</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Minchin reddened and drew herself up.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You ought to have known it,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``but children, unfortunately,
never know what is best for them. Amelia and I always said you were
the cleverest child in the school. Will you not do your duty to your
poor papa and come home with me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Sara took a step toward her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) and stood still. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) was thinking of the
day when she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) had been told that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) belonged to nobody, and was in
danger of being turned into the street; she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) was thinking of the cold,
hungry hours she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) had spent alone with Emily and Melchisedec in the
attic. She (<font color='blue'><b>Melchisedec</b></font>) looked Miss Minchin steadily in the face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You know why I will not go home with you, Miss Minchin,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) said;
<div class="bookquote">``you know quite well.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>A hot flush showed itself on Miss Minchin's hard, angry face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You will never see your companions again,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) began. <div class="bookquote">``I will see
that Ermengarde and Lottie are kept away--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Carmichael/Carmichael</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Carmichael stopped her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) with polite firmness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Excuse me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Carmichael</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>Lottie</b></font>) will see anyone she (<font color='blue'><b>Lottie</b></font>) wishes to see. The
parents of Miss Crewe's fellow-pupils are not likely to refuse her (<font color='blue'><b>Crewe</b></font>)
invitations to visit her (<font color='blue'><b>Crewe</b></font>) at her (<font color='blue'><b>Crewe</b></font>) guardian's house. Mr. Carrisford will
attend to that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>It must be confessed that even Miss Minchin flinched. This was worse
than the eccentric bachelor uncle who might have a peppery temper and
be easily offended at the treatment of his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) niece. A woman of sordid
mind could easily believe that most people would not refuse to allow
their children to remain friends with a little heiress of diamond
mines. And if Mr. Carrisford chose to tell certain of her (<font color='blue'><b>heiress</b></font>) patrons how
unhappy Sara Crewe had been made, many unpleasant things might happen.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You have not undertaken an easy charge,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Crewe</b></font>) said to the Indian
gentleman, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Crewe</b></font>) turned to leave the room; <div class="bookquote">``you will discover that
very soon. The child is neither truthful nor grateful. I suppose'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--to
Sara--<div class="bookquote">``that you feel now that you are a princess again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div><p/>Sara looked down and flushed a little, because she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) thought her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) pet
fancy might not be easy for strangers--even nice ones--to understand at
first.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I--TRIED not to be anything else,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) answered in a low voice--<div class="bookquote">``even
when I was coldest and hungriest--I tried not to be.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now it will not be necessary to try,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Minchin/MISS MINCHIN</b></font>)</div>said Miss Minchin, acidly, as
Ram Dass salaamed her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) out of the room.


<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) returned home and, going to her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) sitting room, sent at once for Miss
Amelia. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amelia</b></font>) sat closeted with her (<font color='blue'><b>Amelia</b></font>) all the rest of the afternoon, and
it must be admitted that poor Miss Amelia passed through more than one
bad quarter of an hour. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amelia</b></font>) shed a good many tears, and mopped her (<font color='blue'><b>Amelia</b></font>)
eyes a good deal. One of her (<font color='blue'><b>Amelia</b></font>) unfortunate remarks almost caused her (<font color='blue'><b>Amelia</b></font>)
sister to snap her (<font color='blue'><b>Amelia</b></font>) head entirely off, but it resulted in an unusual
manner.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm not as clever as you, sister,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Amelia</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``and I am always afraid
to say things to you for fear of making you angry. Perhaps if I were
not so timid it would be better for the school and for both of us. I
must say I've often thought it would have been better if you had been
less severe on Sara Crewe, and had seen that she (<font color='blue'><b>Crewe</b></font>) was decently dressed
and more comfortable. I KNOW she (<font color='blue'><b>Crewe</b></font>) was worked too hard for a child of her (<font color='blue'><b>Crewe</b></font>)
age, and I know she (<font color='blue'><b>Crewe</b></font>) was only half fed--''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How dare you say such a thing!''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Minchin/MISS MINCHIN</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Miss Minchin.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know how I dare,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Amelia/Amelia</b></font>)</div>Miss Amelia answered, with a kind of
reckless courage; <div class="bookquote">``but now I've begun I may as well finish, whatever
happens to me. The child was a clever child and a good child--and she (<font color='blue'><b>Crewe</b></font>)
would have paid you for any kindness you had shown her (<font color='blue'><b>Crewe</b></font>). But you didn't
show her (<font color='blue'><b>Crewe</b></font>) any. The fact was, she (<font color='blue'><b>Crewe</b></font>) was too clever for you, and you always
disliked her (<font color='blue'><b>Crewe</b></font>) for that reason. She (<font color='blue'><b>Crewe</b></font>) used to see through us both--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Amelia/Amelia</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Amelia!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>gasped her (<font color='blue'><b>Amelia</b></font>) infuriated elder, looking as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Amelia</b></font>) would box her (<font color='blue'><b>Amelia</b></font>)
ears and knock her (<font color='blue'><b>Amelia</b></font>) cap off, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Amelia</b></font>) had often done to Becky.

<p/>But Miss Amelia's disappointment had made her (<font color='blue'><b>Amelia</b></font>) hysterical enough not to
care what occurred next.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Amelia</b></font>) did! She (<font color='blue'><b>Amelia</b></font>) did!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Amelia</b></font>) cried. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Amelia</b></font>) saw through us both. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amelia</b></font>) saw that
you were a hard-hearted, worldly woman, and that I was a weak fool, and
that we were both of us vulgar and mean enough to grovel on our knees
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Amelia</b></font>) money, and behave ill to her (<font color='blue'><b>Amelia</b></font>) because it was taken from
her (<font color='blue'><b>Amelia</b></font>)--though she (<font color='blue'><b>Amelia</b></font>) behaved herself like a little princess even when she (<font color='blue'><b>Amelia</b></font>)
was a beggar. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amelia</b></font>) did--she (<font color='blue'><b>Amelia</b></font>) did--like a little princess!''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>And her (<font color='blue'><b>Amelia</b></font>)
hysterics got the better of the poor woman, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Amelia</b></font>) began to laugh and
cry both at once, and rock herself backward and forward.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And now you've lost her (<font color='blue'><b>Amelia</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Amelia</b></font>) cried wildly; <div class="bookquote">``and some other school
will get her (<font color='blue'><b>Amelia</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Amelia</b></font>) money; and if she (<font color='blue'><b>Amelia</b></font>) were like any other child she (<font color='blue'><b>Amelia</b></font>)'d
tell how she (<font color='blue'><b>Amelia</b></font>)'s been treated, and all our pupils would be taken away and
we should be ruined. And it serves us right; but it serves you right
more than it does me, for you are a hard woman, Maria Minchin, you're a
hard, selfish, worldly woman!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Amelia</b></font>) was in danger of making so much noise with her (<font color='blue'><b>Amelia</b></font>) hysterical
chokes and gurgles that her (<font color='blue'><b>Amelia</b></font>) sister was obliged to go to her (<font color='blue'><b>Amelia</b></font>) and apply
salts and sal volatile to quiet her (<font color='blue'><b>Amelia</b></font>), instead of pouring forth her (<font color='blue'><b>Amelia</b></font>)
indignation at her (<font color='blue'><b>Amelia</b></font>) audacity.

<p/>And from that time forward, it may be mentioned, the elder Miss Minchin
actually began to stand a little in awe of a sister who, while she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>)
looked so foolish, was evidently not quite so foolish as she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) looked,
and might, consequently, break out and speak truths people did not want
to hear.

<p/>That evening, when the pupils were gathered together before the fire in
the schoolroom, as was their custom before going to bed, Ermengarde
came in with a letter in her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) hand and a queer expression on her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) round
face. It was queer because, while it was an expression of delighted
excitement, it was combined with such amazement as seemed to belong to
a kind of shock just received.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What IS the matter?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>cried two or three voices at once.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it anything to do with the row that has been going on?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lavinia/Lavinia Herbert</b></font>)</div>said
Lavinia, eagerly. <div class="bookquote">``There has been such a row in Miss Minchin's room,
Miss Amelia has had something like hysterics and has had to go to bed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ermengarde/John/Ermengarde St. John</b></font>)</div><p/>Ermengarde answered them slowly as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Lavinia</b></font>) were half stunned.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have just had this letter from Sara,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Lavinia</b></font>) said, holding it out to
let them see what a long letter it was.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``From Sara!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Every voice joined in that exclamation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where is she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jessie</b></font>)</div>almost shrieked Jessie.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Next door,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ermengarde/John/Ermengarde St. John</b></font>)</div>said Ermengarde, <div class="bookquote">``with the Indian gentleman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ermengarde/John/Ermengarde St. John</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Where? Where? Has she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) been sent away? Does Miss Minchin know? Was
the row about that? Why did she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) write? Tell us! Tell us!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lottie/Lottie Legh</b></font>)</div><p/>There was a perfect babel, and Lottie began to cry plaintively.

<p/>Ermengarde answered them slowly as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Lottie</b></font>) were half plunged out into
what, at the moment, seemed the most important and self-explaining
thing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There WERE diamond mines,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Lottie</b></font>) said stoutly; <div class="bookquote">``there WERE!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Open mouths
and open eyes confronted her (<font color='blue'><b>Lottie</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They were real,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Lottie</b></font>) hurried on. <div class="bookquote">``It was all a mistake about them.
Something happened for a time, and Mr. Carrisford thought they were
ruined--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who is Mr. Carrisford?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jessie</b></font>)</div>shouted Jessie.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The Indian gentleman. And Captain Crewe thought so, too--and he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) died;
and Mr. Carrisford had brain fever and ran away, and HE (<font color='blue'><b>Carrisford</b></font>) almost died.
And he (<font color='blue'><b>Carrisford</b></font>) did not know where Sara was. And it turned out that there were
millions and millions of diamonds in the mines; and half of them belong
to Sara; and they belonged to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) when she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) was living in the attic with
no one but Melchisedec for a friend, and the cook ordering her (<font color='blue'><b>Melchisedec</b></font>) about.
And Mr. Carrisford found her (<font color='blue'><b>Melchisedec</b></font>) this afternoon, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Carrisford</b></font>) has got her (<font color='blue'><b>Melchisedec</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Carrisford</b></font>)
home--and she (<font color='blue'><b>Melchisedec</b></font>) will never come back--and she (<font color='blue'><b>Melchisedec</b></font>) will be more a princess
than she (<font color='blue'><b>Melchisedec</b></font>) ever was--a hundred and fifty thousand times more. And I am
going to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Melchisedec</b></font>) tomorrow afternoon. There!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Minchin/MISS MINCHIN</b></font>)</div><p/>Even Miss Minchin herself could scarcely have controlled the uproar
after this; and though she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) heard the noise, she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) did not try. She (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) was
not in the mood to face anything more than she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) was facing in her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) room,
while Miss Amelia was weeping in bed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amelia</b></font>) knew that the news had
penetrated the walls in some mysterious manner, and that every servant
and every child would go to bed talking about it.

<p/>So until almost midnight the entire seminary, realizing somehow that
all rules were laid aside, crowded round Ermengarde in the schoolroom
and heard read and re-read the letter containing a story which was
quite as wonderful as any Sara herself had ever invented, and which had
the amazing charm of having happened to Sara herself and the mystic
Indian gentleman in the very next house.

<p/>Becky, who had heard it also, managed to creep up stairs earlier than
usual. She (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) wanted to get away from people and go and look at the
little magic room once more. She (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) did not know what would happen to it.
It was not likely that it would be left to Miss Minchin. It would be
taken away, and the attic would be bare and empty again. Glad as she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>)
was for Sara's sake, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) went up the last flight of stairs with a lump
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) throat and tears blurring her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) sight. There would be no fire
tonight, and no rosy lamp; no supper, and no princess sitting in the
glow reading or telling stories--no princess!

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) choked down a sob as she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) pushed the attic door open, and then she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>)
broke into a low cry.

<p/>The lamp was flushing the room, the fire was blazing, the supper was
waiting; and Ram Dass was standing smiling into her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) startled face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Missee sahib remembered,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Dass</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Melchisedec</b></font>) told the sahib all. She (<font color='blue'><b>Melchisedec</b></font>)
wished you to know the good fortune which has befallen her (<font color='blue'><b>Melchisedec</b></font>). Behold a
letter on the tray. She (<font color='blue'><b>Melchisedec</b></font>) has written. She (<font color='blue'><b>Melchisedec</b></font>) did not wish that you should
go to sleep unhappy. The sahib commands you to come to him (<font color='blue'><b>sahib</b></font>) tomorrow.
You are to be the attendant of missee sahib. Tonight I take these
things back over the roof.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And having said this with a beaming face, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dass</b></font>) made a little salaam and
slipped through the skylight with an agile silentness of movement which
showed Becky how easily he (<font color='blue'><b>Dass</b></font>) had done it before.



<p/>19

<p/>Anne


<p/>Never had such joy reigned in the nursery of the Large Family. Never
had they dreamed of such delights as resulted from an intimate
acquaintance with the little-girl-who-was-not-a-beggar. The mere fact
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) sufferings and adventures made her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) a priceless possession.
Everybody wanted to be told over and over again the things which had
happened to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>). When one was sitting by a warm fire in a big, glowing
room, it was quite delightful to hear how cold it could be in an attic.
It must be admitted that the attic was rather delighted in, and that
its coldness and bareness quite sank into insignificance when
Melchisedec was remembered, and one heard about the sparrows and things
one could see if one climbed on the table and stuck one's head and
shoulders out of the skylight.

<p/>Of course the thing loved best was the story of the banquet and the
dream which was true. Sara told it for the first time the day after
she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) had been found. Several members of the Large Family came to take
tea with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>), and as they sat or curled up on the hearth-rug she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) told
the story in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) own way, and the Indian gentleman listened and watched
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>). When she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) had finished she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) looked up at him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) and put her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) hand on his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
knee.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That is my part,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Now won't you tell your part of it,
Uncle Tom?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) to call him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) always <div class="bookquote">``Uncle Tom.''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I don't
know your part yet, and it must be beautiful.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>So he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) told them how, when he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) sat alone, ill and dull and irritable, Ram
Dass had tried to distract him (<font color='blue'><b>Dass</b></font>) by describing the passers by, and there
was one child who passed oftener than any one else; he (<font color='blue'><b>Dass</b></font>) had begun to be
interested in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>)--partly perhaps because he (<font color='blue'><b>Dass</b></font>) was thinking a great deal
of a little girl, and partly because Ram Dass had been able to relate
the incident of his (<font color='blue'><b>Dass</b></font>) visit to the attic in chase of the monkey. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dass</b></font>) had
described its cheerless look, and the bearing of the child, who seemed
as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) was not of the class of those who were treated as drudges and
servants. Bit by bit, Ram Dass had made discoveries concerning the
wretchedness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) life. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dass</b></font>) had found out how easy a matter it was to
climb across the few yards of roof to the skylight, and this fact had
been the beginning of all that followed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sahib,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Dass</b></font>) had said one day, <div class="bookquote">``I could cross the slates and make the
child a fire when she (<font color='blue'><b>sahib</b></font>) is out on some errand. When she (<font color='blue'><b>sahib</b></font>) returned, wet
and cold, to find it blazing, she (<font color='blue'><b>sahib</b></font>) would think a magician had done it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The idea had been so fanciful that Mr. Carrisford's sad face had
lighted with a smile, and Ram Dass had been so filled with rapture that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Dass</b></font>) had enlarged upon it and explained to his (<font color='blue'><b>Dass</b></font>) master how simple it would
be to accomplish numbers of other things. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dass</b></font>) had shown a childlike
pleasure and invention, and the preparations for the carrying out of
the plan had filled many a day with interest which would otherwise have
dragged wearily. On the night of the frustrated banquet Ram Dass had
kept watch, all his (<font color='blue'><b>Dass</b></font>) packages being in readiness in the attic which was
his (<font color='blue'><b>Dass</b></font>) own; and the person who was to help him (<font color='blue'><b>Dass</b></font>) had waited with him (<font color='blue'><b>Dass</b></font>), as
interested as himself in the odd adventure. Ram Dass had been lying
flat upon the slates, looking in at the skylight, when the banquet had
come to its disastrous conclusion; he (<font color='blue'><b>Dass</b></font>) had been sure of the profoundness
of Sara's wearied sleep; and then, with a dark lantern, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dass</b></font>) had crept
into the room, while his (<font color='blue'><b>Dass</b></font>) companion remained outside and handed the
things to him (<font color='blue'><b>Dass</b></font>). When Sara had stirred ever so faintly, Ram Dass had
closed the lantern-slide and lain flat upon the floor. These and many
other exciting things the children found out by asking a thousand
questions.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am so glad,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>Sara said. <div class="bookquote">``I am so GLAD it was you who were my friend!''

 (<font color='red'><b>friends</b></font>)</div><p/>There never were such friends as these two became. Somehow, they
seemed to suit each other in a wonderful way. The Indian gentleman had
never had a companion he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) liked quite as much as he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) liked Sara. In a
month's time he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was, as Mr. Carmichael had prophesied he (<font color='blue'><b>Carmichael</b></font>) would be, a
new man. He (<font color='blue'><b>Carmichael</b></font>) was always amused and interested, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Carmichael</b></font>) began to find an
actual pleasure in the possession of the wealth he (<font color='blue'><b>Carmichael</b></font>) had imagined that he (<font color='blue'><b>Carmichael</b></font>)
loathed the burden of. There were so many charming things to plan for
Sara. There was a little joke between them that he (<font color='blue'><b>Carmichael</b></font>) was a magician, and
it was one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Carmichael</b></font>) pleasures to invent things to surprise her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>)
found beautiful new flowers growing in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) room, whimsical little gifts
tucked under pillows, and once, as they sat together in the evening,
they heard the scratch of a heavy paw on the door, and when Sara went
to find out what it was, there stood a great dog--a splendid Russian
boarhound--with a grand silver and gold collar bearing an inscription.
<div class="bookquote">``I am Boris,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>it read; <div class="bookquote">``I serve the Princess Sara.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div><p/>There was nothing the Indian gentleman loved more than the recollection
of the little princess in rags and tatters. The afternoons in which
the Large Family, or Ermengarde and Lottie, gathered to rejoice
together were very delightful. But the hours when Sara and the Indian
gentleman sat alone and read or talked had a special charm of their
own. During their passing many interesting things occurred.

<p/>One evening, Mr. Carrisford, looking up from his (<font color='blue'><b>Carrisford</b></font>) book, noticed that his (<font color='blue'><b>Carrisford</b></font>)
companion had not stirred for some time, but sat gazing into the fire.

<p/>``What are you ``supposing,<div class="bookquote">'' Sara?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Carrisford</b></font>) asked.

<p/>Sara looked up, with a bright color on her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) cheek.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I WAS supposing,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``I was remembering that hungry day, and a
child I saw.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But there were a great many hungry days,''  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>said the Indian gentleman,
with rather a sad tone in his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) voice. <div class="bookquote">``Which hungry day was it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I forgot you didn't know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>said Sara. <div class="bookquote">``It was the day the dream came
true.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) told him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) the story of the bun shop, and the fourpence she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>)
picked up out of the sloppy mud, and the child who was hungrier than
herself. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) told it quite simply, and in as few words as possible;
but somehow the Indian gentleman found it necessary to shade his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) eyes
with his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) hand and look down at the carpet.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And I was supposing a kind of plan,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) said, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) had finished.
<div class="bookquote">``I was thinking I should like to do something.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What was it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Carrisford/Carrisford</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Carrisford, in a low tone. <div class="bookquote">``You may do
anything you like to do, princess.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I was wondering,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>rather hesitated Sara--<div class="bookquote">``you know, you say I have so
much money--I was wondering if I could go to see the bun-woman, and
tell her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) that if, when hungry children--particularly on those dreadful
days--come and sit on the steps, or look in at the window, she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) would
just call them in and give them something to eat, she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) might send the
bills to me. Could I do that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You shall do it tomorrow morning,''  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>said the Indian gentleman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>said Sara. <div class="bookquote">``You see, I know what it is to be hungry, and
it is very hard when one cannot even PRETEND it away.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, yes, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>said the Indian gentleman. <div class="bookquote">``Yes, yes, it must be.
Try to forget it. Come and sit on this footstool near my knee, and
only remember you are a princess.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>said Sara, smiling; <div class="bookquote">``and I can give buns and bread to the
populace.''  (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) went and sat on the stool, and the Indian gentleman
-LRB-he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) used to like her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) to call him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) that, too, sometimes-RRB- drew her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) small
dark head down on his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) knee and stroked her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) hair.

<p/>The next morning, Miss Minchin, in looking out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) window, saw the
things she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) perhaps least enjoyed seeing. The Indian gentleman's
carriage, with its tall horses, drew up before the door of the next
house, and its owner and a little figure, warm with soft, rich furs,
descended the steps to get into it. The little figure was a familiar
one, and reminded Miss Minchin of days in the past. It was followed by
another as familiar--the sight of which she (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) found very irritating. It
was Becky, who, in the character of delighted attendant, always
accompanied her (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) young mistress to her (<font color='blue'><b>Becky</b></font>) carriage, carrying wraps and
belongings. Already Becky had a pink, round face.

<p/>A little later the carriage drew up before the door of the baker's
shop, and its occupants got out, oddly enough, just as the bun-woman
was putting a tray of smoking-hot buns into the window.

<p/>When Sara entered the shop the woman turned and looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>), and,
leaving the buns, came and stood behind the counter. For a moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>)
looked at Sara very hard indeed, and then her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) good-natured face lighted
up.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm sure that I remember you, miss,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``And yet--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>said Sara; <div class="bookquote">``once you gave me six buns for fourpence, and--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you gave five of 'em to a beggar child,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>the woman broke in on
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I've always remembered it. I couldn't make it out at first.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>)
turned round to the Indian gentleman and spoke her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) next words to him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``I beg your pardon, sir, but there's not many young people that notices
a hungry face in that way; and I've thought of it many a time. Excuse
the liberty, miss,'' (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>--to Sara--<div class="bookquote">``but you look rosier and--well, better
than you did that--that--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am better, thank you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>said Sara. <div class="bookquote">``And--I am much happier--and I
have come to ask you to do something for me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Me, miss!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>exclaimed the bun-woman, smiling cheerfully. <div class="bookquote">``Why, bless
you! Yes, miss. What can I do?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div><p/>And then Sara, leaning on the counter, made her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) little proposal
concerning the dreadful days and the hungry waifs and the buns.

<p/>The woman watched her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), and listened with an astonished face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, bless me!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said again when she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had heard it all; <div class="bookquote">``it'll be a
pleasure to me to do it. I am a working-woman myself and cannot afford
to do much on my own account, and there's sights of trouble on every
side; but, if you'll excuse me, I'm bound to say I've given away many a
bit of bread since that wet afternoon, just along o' thinking of
you--an' how wet an' cold you was, an' how hungry you looked; an' yet
you gave away your hot buns as if you was a princess.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>The Indian gentleman smiled involuntarily at this, and Sara smiled a
little, too, remembering what she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) had said to herself when she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) put the
buns down on the ravenous child's ragged lap.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) looked so hungry,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) was even hungrier than I was.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) was starving,''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>said the woman. <div class="bookquote">``Many's the time she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>)'s told me of
it since--how she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) sat there in the wet, and felt as if a wolf was
a-tearing at her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) poor young insides.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, have you seen her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) since then?''  (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Sara. <div class="bookquote">``Do you know where
she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) is?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I do,''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>answered the woman, smiling more good-naturedly than ever.
<div class="bookquote">``Why, she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>)'s in that there back room, miss, an' has been for a month;
an' a decent, well-meanin' girl she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)'s goin' to turn out, an' such a
help to me in the shop an' in the kitchen as you'd scarce believe,
knowin' how she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)'s lived.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) stepped to the door of the little back parlor and spoke; and the
next minute a girl came out and followed her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) behind the counter. And
actually it was the beggar-child, clean and neatly clothed, and looking
as if she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had not been hungry for a long time. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) looked shy, but she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
had a nice face, now that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was no longer a savage, and the wild look
had gone from her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) eyes. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) knew Sara in an instant, and stood and
looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) as if she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) could never look enough.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You see,''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>said the woman, <div class="bookquote">``I told her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) to come when she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was hungry, and
when she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)'d come I'd give her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) odd jobs to do; an' I found she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was
willing, and somehow I got to like her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>); and the end of it was, I've
given her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) a place an' a home, and she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) helps me, an' behaves well, an'
is as thankful as a girl can be. Her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) name's Anne. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) has no other.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div><p/>The children stood and looked at each other for a few minutes; and then
Sara took her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) hand out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) muff and held it out across the counter,
and Anne took it, and they looked straight into each other's eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am so glad,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sara/Crewe/Sara Crewe</b></font>)</div>Sara said. <div class="bookquote">``And I have just thought of something.
Perhaps Mrs. Brown will let you be the one to give the buns and bread
to the children. Perhaps you would like to do it because you know what
it is to be hungry, too.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, miss,''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>said the girl.

<p/>And, somehow, Sara felt as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) understood her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>), though she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) said so
little, and only stood still and looked and looked after her (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sara</b></font>)
went out of the shop with the Indian gentleman, and they got into the
carriage and drove away.
