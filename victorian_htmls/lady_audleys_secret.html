<p/>LADY AUDLEY``S SECRET

<p/>By Mary Elizabeth Braddon



<p/>CHAPTER I.

<p/>LUCY.

<p/>It lay down in a hollow, rich with fine old timber and luxuriant pastures; and you came upon it through an avenue of limes, bordered on either side by meadows, over the high hedges of which the cattle looked inquisitively at you as you passed, wondering, perhaps, what you wanted; for there was no thorough-fare, and unless you were going to the Court you had no business there at all.

<p/>At the end of this avenue there was an old arch and a clock tower, with a stupid, bewildering clock, which had only one hand--and which jumped straight from one hour to the next--and was therefore always in extremes. Through this arch you walked straight into the gardens of Audley Court.

<p/>A smooth lawn lay before you, dotted with groups of rhododendrons, which grew in more perfection here than anywhere else in the county. To the right there were the kitchen gardens, the fish-pond, and an orchard bordered by a dry moat, and a broken ruin of a wall, in some places thicker than it was high, and everywhere overgrown with trailing ivy, yellow stonecrop, and dark moss. To the left there was a broad graveled walk, down which, years ago, when the place had been a convent, the quiet nuns had walked hand in hand; a wall bordered with espaliers, and shadowed on one side by goodly oaks, which shut out the flat landscape, and circled in the house and gardens with a darkening shelter.

<p/>The house faced the arch, and occupied three sides of a quadrangle. It was very old, and very irregular and rambling. The windows were uneven; some small, some large, some with heavy stone mullions and rich stained glass; others with frail lattices that rattled in every breeze; others so modern that they might have been added only yesterday. Great piles of chimneys rose up here and there behind the pointed gables, and seemed as if they were so broken down by age and long service that they must have fallen but for the straggling ivy which, crawling up the walls and trailing even over the roof, wound itself about them and supported them. The principal door was squeezed into a corner of a turret at one angle of the building, as if it were in hiding from dangerous visitors, and wished to keep itself a secret--a noble door for all that--old oak, and studded with great square-headed iron nails, and so thick that the sharp iron knocker struck upon it with a muffled sound, and the visitor rung a clanging bell that dangled in a corner among the ivy, lest the noise of the knocking should never penetrate the stronghold.

<p/>A glorious old place. A place that visitors fell in raptures with; feeling a yearning wish to have done with life, and to stay there forever, staring into the cool fish-ponds and counting the bubbles as the roach and carp rose to the surface of the water. A spot in which peace seemed to have taken up her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) abode, setting her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) soothing hand on every tree and flower, on the still ponds and quiet alleys, the shady corners of the old-fashioned rooms, the deep window-seats behind the painted glass, the low meadows and the stately avenues--ay, even upon the stagnant well, which, cool and sheltered as all else in the old place, hid itself away in a shrubbery behind the gardens, with an idle handle that was never turned and a lazy rope so rotten that the pail had broken away from it, and had fallen into the water.

<p/>A noble place; inside as well as out, a noble place--a house in which you incontinently lost yourself if ever you were so rash as to attempt to penetrate its mysteries alone; a house in which no one room had any sympathy with another, every chamber running off at a tangent into an inner chamber, and through that down some narrow staircase leading to a door which, in its turn, led back into that very part of the house from which you thought yourself the furthest; a house that could never have been planned by any mortal architect, but must have been the handiwork of that good old builder, Time, who, adding a room one year, and knocking down a room another year, toppling down a chimney coeval with the Plantagenets, and setting up one in the style of the Tudors; shaking down a bit of Saxon wall, allowing a Norman arch to stand here; throwing in a row of high narrow windows in the reign of Queen Anne, and joining on a dining-room after the fashion of the time of Hanoverian George I, to a refectory that had been standing since the Conquest, had contrived, in some eleven centuries, to run up such a mansion as was not elsewhere to be met with throughout the county of Essex. Of course, in such a house there were secret chambers; the little daughter of the present owner, Sir Michael Audley, had fallen by accident upon the discovery of one. A board had rattled under her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) feet in the great nursery where she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) played, and on attention being drawn to it, it was found to be loose, and so removed, revealed a ladder, leading to a hiding-place between the floor of the nursery and the ceiling of the room below--a hiding-place so small that he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) who had hid there must have crouched on his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) hands and knees or lain at full length, and yet large enough to contain a quaint old carved oak chest, half filled with priests' vestments, which had been hidden away, no doubt, in those cruel days when the life of a man was in danger if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was discovered to have harbored a Roman Catholic priest, or to have mass said in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) house.

<p/>The broad outer moat was dry and grass-grown, and the laden trees of the orchard hung over it with gnarled, straggling branches that drew fantastical shadows upon the green slope. Within this moat there was, as I have said, the fish-pond--a sheet of water that extended the whole length of the garden and bordering which there was an avenue called the lime-tree walk; an avenue so shaded from the sun and sky, so screened from observation by the thick shelter of the over-arching trees that it seemed a chosen place for secret meetings or for stolen interviews; a place in which a conspiracy might have been planned, or a lover's vow registered with equal safety; and yet it was scarcely twenty paces from the house.

<p/>At the end of this dark arcade there was the shrubbery, where, half buried among the tangled branches and the neglected weeds, stood the rusty wheel of that old well of which I have spoken. It had been of good service in its time, no doubt; and busy nuns have perhaps drawn the cool water with their own fair hands; but it had fallen into disuse now, and scarcely any one at Audley Court knew whether the spring had dried up or not. But sheltered as was the solitude of this lime-tree walk, I doubt very much if it was ever put to any romantic uses. Often in the cool of the evening Sir Michael Audley would stroll up and down smoking his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) cigar, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) dogs at his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) heels, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) pretty young wife dawdling by his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) side; but in about ten minutes the baronet and his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) companion would grow tired of the rustling limes and the still water, hidden under the spreading leaves of the water-lilies, and the long green vista with the broken well at the end, and would stroll back to the drawing-room, where my lady played dreamy melodies by Beethoven and Mendelssohn till her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) husband fell asleep in his (<font color='blue'><b>Beethoven</b></font>) easy-chair.

<p/>Sir Michael Audley was fifty-six years of age, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) had married a second wife three months after his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) fifty-fifth birthday. He (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) was a big man, tall and stout, with a deep, sonorous voice, handsome black eyes, and a white beard--a white beard which made him (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) look venerable against his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) will, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) was as active as a boy, and one of the hardest riders in the country. For seventeen years he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) had been a widower with an only child, a daughter, Alicia Audley, now eighteen, and by no means too well pleased at having a step-mother brought home to the Court; for Miss Alicia had reigned supreme in her (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) father's house since her (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) earliest childhood, and had carried the keys, and jingled them in the pockets of her (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) silk aprons, and lost them in the shrubbery, and dropped them into the pond, and given all manner of trouble about them from the hour in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) entered her (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) teens, and had, on that account, deluded herself into the sincere belief, that for the whole of that period, she (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) had been keeping the house.

<p/>But Miss Alicia's day was over; and now, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) asked anything of the housekeeper, the housekeeper would tell her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) would speak to my lady, or she (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) would consult my lady, and if my lady pleased it should be done. So the baronet's daughter, who was an excellent horsewoman and a very clever artist, spent most of her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) time out of doors, riding about the green lanes, and sketching the cottage children, and the plow-boys, and the cattle, and all manner of animal life that came in her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) way. She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) set her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) face with a sulky determination against any intimacy between herself and the baronet's young wife; and amiable as that lady was, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) found it quite impossible to overcome Miss Alicia's prejudices and dislike; or to convince the spoilt girl that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had not done her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) a cruel injury by marrying Sir Michael Audley. The truth was that Lady Audley had, in becoming the wife of Sir Michael, made one of those apparently advantageous matches which are apt to draw upon a woman the envy and hatred of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) sex. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had come into the neighborhood as a governess in the family of a surgeon in the village near Audley Court. No one knew anything of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), except that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) came in answer to an advertisement which Mr. Dawson, the surgeon, had inserted in The Times. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) came from London; and the only reference she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) gave was to a lady at a school at Brompton, where she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had once been a teacher. But this reference was so satisfactory that none other was needed, and Miss Lucy Graham was received by the surgeon as the instructress of his (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) daughters. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) accomplishments were so brilliant and numerous, that it seemed strange that she (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) should have answered an advertisement offering such very moderate terms of remuneration as those named by Mr. Dawson; but Miss Graham seemed perfectly well satisfied with her (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) situation, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) taught the girls to play sonatas by Beethoven, and to paint from nature after Creswick, and walked through a dull, out-of-the-way village to the humble little church, three times every Sunday, as contentedly as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) had no higher aspiration in the world than to do so all the rest of her (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) life.

<p/>People who observed this, accounted for it by saying that it was a part of her (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) amiable and gentle nature always to be light-hearted, happy and contented under any circumstances.

<p/>Wherever she (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) went she (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) seemed to take joy and brightness with her (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>). In the cottages of the poor her (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) fair face shone like a sunbeam. She (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) would sit for a quarter of an hour talking to some old woman, and apparently as pleased with the admiration of a toothless crone as if she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had been listening to the compliments of a marquis; and when she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) tripped away, leaving nothing behind her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) -LRB-for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) poor salary gave no scope to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) benevolence-RRB-, the old woman would burst out into senile raptures with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) grace, beauty, and her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) kindliness, such as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) never bestowed upon the vicar's wife, who half fed and clothed her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). For you see, Miss Lucy Graham was blessed with that magic power of fascination, by which a woman can charm with a word or intoxicate with a smile. Every one loved, admired, and praised her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). The boy who opened the five-barred gate that stood in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) pathway, ran home to his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) mother to tell of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) pretty looks, and the sweet voice in which she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) thanked him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) for the little service. The verger at the church, who ushered her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) into the surgeon's pew; the vicar, who saw the soft blue eyes uplifted to his (<font color='blue'><b>vicar</b></font>) face as he (<font color='blue'><b>vicar</b></font>) preached his (<font color='blue'><b>vicar</b></font>) simple sermon; the porter from the railway station, who brought her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) sometimes a letter or a parcel, and who never looked for reward from her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>); her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) employer; his (<font color='blue'><b>vicar</b></font>) visitors; her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) pupils; the servants; everybody, high and low, united in declaring that Lucy Graham was the sweetest girl that ever lived.

<p/>Perhaps it was the rumor of this which penetrated into the quiet chamber of Audley Court; or, perhaps, it was the sight of her (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) pretty face, looking over the surgeon's high pew every Sunday morning; however it was, it was certain that Sir Michael Audley suddenly experienced a strong desire to be better acquainted with Mr. Dawson's governess.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Dawson</b></font>) had only to hint his (<font color='blue'><b>Dawson</b></font>) wish to the worthy doctor for a little party to be got up, to which the vicar and his (<font color='blue'><b>vicar</b></font>) wife, and the baronet and his (<font color='blue'><b>vicar</b></font>) daughter, were invited.

<p/>That one quiet evening sealed Sir Michael's fate. He (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) could no more resist the tender fascination of those soft and melting blue eyes; the graceful beauty of that slender throat and drooping head, with its wealth of showering flaxen curls; the low music of that gentle voice; the perfect harmony which pervaded every charm, and made all doubly charming in this woman; than he (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) could resist his (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) destiny! Destiny! Why, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was his (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) destiny! He (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) had never loved before. What had been his (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) marriage with Alicia's mother but a dull, jog-trot bargain made to keep some estate in the family that would have been just as well out of it? What had been his (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) love for his (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) first wife but a poor, pitiful, smoldering spark, too dull to be extinguished, too feeble to burn? But this was love--this fever, this longing, this restless, uncertain, miserable hesitation; these cruel fears that his (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) age was an insurmountable barrier to his (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) happiness; this sick hatred of his (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) white beard; this frenzied wish to be young again, with glistening raven hair, and a slim waist, such as he (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) had twenty years before; these, wakeful nights and melancholy days, so gloriously brightened if he (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) chanced to catch a glimpse of her (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) sweet face behind the window curtains, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) drove past the surgeon's house; all these signs gave token of the truth, and told only too plainly that, at the sober age of fifty-five, Sir Michael Audley had fallen ill of the terrible fever called love.

<p/>I do not think that, throughout his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) courtship, the baronet once calculated upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) wealth or his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) position as reasons for his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) success. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) ever remembered these things, he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) dismissed the thought of them with a shudder. It pained him (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) too much to believe for a moment that any one so lovely and innocent could value herself against a splendid house or a good old title. No; his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) hope was that, as her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) life had been most likely one of toil and dependence, and as she (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) was very young nobody exactly knew her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) age, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) looked little more than twenty, she (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) might never have formed any attachment, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>), being the first to woo her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>), might, by tender attentions, by generous watchfulness, by a love which should recall to her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) the father she (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) had lost, and by a protecting care that should make him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) necessary to her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>), win her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) young heart, and obtain from her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) fresh and earliest love, the promise of her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) hand. It was a very romantic day-dream, no doubt; but, for all that, it seemed in a very fair way to be realized. Lucy Graham appeared by no means to dislike the baronet's attentions. There was nothing whatever in her (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) manner that betrayed the shallow artifices employed by a woman who wishes to captivate a rich man. She (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) was so accustomed to admiration from every one, high and low, that Sir Michael's conduct made very little impression upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>). Again, he (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) had been so many years a widower that people had given up the idea of his (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) ever marrying again. At last, however, Mrs. Dawson spoke to the governess on the subject. The surgeon's wife was sitting in the school-room busy at work, while Lucy was putting the finishing touches on some water-color sketches done by her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) pupils.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you know, my dear Miss Graham,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Dawson</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Dawson, <div class="bookquote">``I think you ought to consider yourself a remarkably lucky girl?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Dawson</b></font>)</div><p/>The governess lifted her (<font color='blue'><b>Dawson</b></font>) head from its stooping attitude, and stared wonderingly at her (<font color='blue'><b>Dawson</b></font>) employer, shaking back a shower of curls. They were the most wonderful curls in the world--soft and feathery, always floating away from her (<font color='blue'><b>Dawson</b></font>) face, and making a pale halo round her (<font color='blue'><b>Dawson</b></font>) head when the sunlight shone through them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you mean, my dear Mrs. Dawson?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Dawson</b></font>) asked, dipping her (<font color='blue'><b>Dawson</b></font>) camel's-hair brush into the wet aquamarine upon the palette, and poising it carefully before putting in the delicate streak of purple which was to brighten the horizon in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dawson</b></font>) pupil's sketch.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, I mean, my dear, that it only rests with yourself to become Lady Audley, and the mistress of Audley Court.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Graham/Lucy Graham</b></font>)</div><p/>Lucy Graham dropped the brush upon the picture, and flushed scarlet to the roots of her (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) fair hair; and then grew pale again, far paler than Mrs. Dawson had ever seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Dawson</b></font>) before.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear, don't agitate yourself,''  (<font color='red'><b>the surgeon</b></font>)</div>said the surgeon's wife, soothingly; <div class="bookquote">``you know that nobody asks you to marry Sir Michael unless you wish. Of course it would be a magnificent match; he (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) has a splendid income, and is one of the most generous of men. Your position would be very high, and you would be enabled to do a great deal of good; but, as I said before, you must be entirely guided by your own feelings. Only one thing I must say, and that is that if Sir Michael's attentions are not agreeable to you, it is really scarcely honorable to encourage him (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>surgeon wife</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``His (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) attentions--encourage him (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Graham/Lucy Graham</b></font>)</div>muttered Lucy, as if the words bewildered her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Pray, pray don't talk to me, Mrs. Dawson. I had no idea of this. It is the last thing that would have occurred to me.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) leaned her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) elbows on the drawing-board before her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>), and clasping her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) hands over her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) face, seemed for some minutes to be thinking deeply. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) wore a narrow black ribbon round her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) neck, with a locket, or a cross, or a miniature, perhaps, attached to it; but whatever the trinket was, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) always kept it hidden under her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) dress. Once or twice, while she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) sat silently thinking, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) removed one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) hands from before her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) face, and fidgeted nervously with the ribbon, clutching at it with a half-angry gesture, and twisting it backward and forward between her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) fingers.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think some people are born to be unlucky, Mrs. Dawson,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) said, by-and-by; <div class="bookquote">``it would be a great deal too much good fortune for me to become Lady Audley.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) said this with so much bitterness in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) tone, that the surgeon's wife looked up at her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) with surprise.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You unlucky, my dear!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) exclaimed. <div class="bookquote">``I think you are the last person who ought to talk like that--you, such a bright, happy creature, that it does every one good to see you. I'm sure I don't know what we shall do if Sir Michael robs us of you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Graham/Lucy Graham</b></font>)</div><p/>After this conversation they often spoke upon the subject, and Lucy never again showed any emotion whatever when the baronet's admiration for her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) was canvassed. It was a tacitly understood thing in the surgeon's family that whenever Sir Michael proposed, the governess would quietly accept him (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>); and, indeed, the simple Dawsons would have thought it something more than madness in a penniless girl to reject such an offer.

<p/>So, one misty August evening, Sir Michael, sitting opposite to Lucy Graham, at a window in the surgeon's little drawing-room, took an opportunity while the family happened by some accident to be absent from the room, of speaking upon the subject nearest to his (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) heart. He (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) made the governess, in a few but solemn words, an offer of his (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) hand. There was something almost touching in the manner and tone in which he (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) spoke to her (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>)--half in deprecation, knowing that he (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) could hardly expect to be the choice of a beautiful young girl, and praying rather that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) would reject him (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>), even though she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) broke his (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) heart by doing so, than that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) should accept his (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) offer if she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) did not love him (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I scarcely think there is a greater sin, Lucy,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) said, solemnly, <div class="bookquote">``than that of a woman who marries a man she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) does not love. You are so precious to me, my beloved, that deeply as my heart is set on this, and bitter as the mere thought of disappointment is to me, I would not have you commit such a sin for any happiness of mine. If my happiness could be achieved by such an act, which it could not--which it never could,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) repeated, earnestly--<div class="bookquote">``nothing but misery can result from a marriage dictated by any motive but truth and love.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Lucy Graham was not looking at Sir Michael, but straight out into the misty twilight and dim landscape far away beyond the little garden. The baronet tried to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) face, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) profile was turned to him (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) could not discover the expression of her (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) eyes. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) could have done so, he (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) would have seen a yearning gaze which seemed as if it would have pierced the far obscurity and looked away--away into another world.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Lucy, you heard me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) said, gravely; not coldly, or in any way as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) were offended at his (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) words.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And your answer?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) did not remove her (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) gaze from the darkening country side, but for some moments was quite silent; then turning to him (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>), with a sudden passion in her (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) manner, that lighted up her (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) face with a new and wonderful beauty which the baronet perceived even in the growing twilight, she (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) fell on her (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) knees at his (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) feet.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, Lucy; no, no!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) cried, vehemently, <div class="bookquote">``not here, not here!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, here, here,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) said, the strange passion which agitated her (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) making her (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) voice sound shrill and piercing--not loud, but preternaturally distinct; <div class="bookquote">``here and nowhere else. How good you are--how noble and how generous! Love you! Why, there are women a hundred times my superiors in beauty and in goodness who might love you dearly; but you ask too much of me! Remember what my life has been; only remember that! From my very babyhood I have never seen anything but poverty. My father was a gentleman: clever, accomplished, handsome--but poor--and what a pitiful wretch poverty made of him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)! My mother--But do not let me speak of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). Poverty--poverty, trials, vexations, humiliations, deprivations. You cannot tell; you, who are among those for whom life is so smooth and easy, you can never guess what is endured by such as we. Do not ask too much of me, then. I cannot be disinterested; I cannot be blind to the advantages of such an alliance. I cannot, I cannot!''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>Beyond her (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) agitation and her (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) passionate vehemence, there is an undefined something in her (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) manner which fills the baronet with a vague alarm. She (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) is still on the ground at his (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) feet, crouching rather than kneeling, her (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) thin white dress clinging about her (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>), her (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) pale hair streaming over her (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) shoulders, her (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) great blue eyes glittering in the dusk, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) hands clutching at the black ribbon about her (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) throat, as if it had been strangling her (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Don't ask too much of me,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) kept repeating; <div class="bookquote">``I have been selfish from my babyhood.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Lucy--Lucy, speak plainly. Do you dislike me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dislike you? No--no!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But is there any one else whom you love?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) laughed aloud at his (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) question. <div class="bookquote">``I do not love any one in the world,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) answered.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) was glad of her (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) reply; and yet that and the strange laugh jarred upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) feelings. He (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) was silent for some moments, and then said, with a kind of effort:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, Lucy, I will not ask too much of you. I dare say I am a romantic old fool; but if you do not dislike me, and if you do not love any one else, I see no reason why we should not make a very happy couple. Is it a bargain, Lucy?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The baronet</b></font>)</div><p/>The baronet lifted her (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) arms and kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) once upon the forehead, then quietly bidding her (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) good-night, he (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) walked straight out of the house.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) walked straight out of the house, this foolish old man, because there was some strong emotion at work in his (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) breast--neither joy nor triumph, but something almost akin to disappointment--some stifled and unsatisfied longing which lay heavy and dull at his (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) heart, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) had carried a corpse in his (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) bosom. He (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) carried the corpse of that hope which had died at the sound of Lucy's words. All the doubts and fears and timid aspirations were ended now. He (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) must be contented, like other men of his (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) age, to be married for his (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) fortune and his (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) position.

<p/>Lucy Graham went slowly up the stairs to her (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) little room at the top of the house. She (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) placed her (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) dim candle on the chest of drawers, and seated herself on the edge of the white bed, still and white as the draperies hanging around her (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No more dependence, no more drudgery, no more humiliations,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``every trace of the old life melted away--every clew to identity buried and forgotten--except these, except these.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) had never taken her (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) left hand from the black ribbon at her (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) throat. She (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) drew it from her (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) bosom, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) spoke, and looked at the object attached to it.

<p/>It was neither a locket, a miniature, nor a cross; it was a ring wrapped in an oblong piece of paper--the paper partly written, partly printed, yellow with age, and crumpled with much folding.

<p/>CHAPTER II.

<p/>ON BOARD THE ARGUS.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) threw the end of his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) cigar into the water, and leaning his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) elbows upon the bulwarks, stared meditatively at the waves.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How wearisome they are,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``blue and green, and opal; opal, and blue, and green; all very well in their way, of course, but three months of them are rather too much, especially--''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) did not attempt to finish his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) sentence; his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) thoughts seemed to wander in the very midst of it, and carry him (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) a thousand miles or so away.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Poor little girl, how pleased she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)'ll be!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) muttered, opening his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) cigar-case, lazily surveying its contents; <div class="bookquote">``how pleased and how surprised? Poor little girl. After three years and a half, too; she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) will be surprised.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) was a young man of about five-and-twenty, with dark face bronzed by exposure to the sun; he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) had handsome brown eyes, with a lazy smile in them that sparkled through the black lashes, and a bushy beard and mustache that covered the whole lower part of his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) face. He (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) was tall and powerfully built; he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) wore a loose gray suit and a felt hat, thrown carelessly upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) black hair. His (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) name was George Talboys, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) was aft-cabin passenger on board the good ship Argus, laden with Australian wool and sailing from Sydney to Liverpool.

<p/>There were very few passengers in the aft-cabin of the Argus. An elderly wool-stapler returning to his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) native country with his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) wife and daughters, after having made a fortune in the colonies; a governess of three-and-thirty years of age, going home to marry a man to whom she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had been engaged fifteen years; the sentimental daughter of a wealthy Australian wine-merchant, invoiced to England to finish her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) education, and George Talboys, were the only first-class passengers on board.

<p/>This George Talboys was the life and soul of the vessel; nobody knew who or what he (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) was, or where he (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) came from, but everybody liked him (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) sat at the bottom of the dinner-table, and assisted the captain in doing the honors of the friendly meal. He (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) opened the champagne bottles, and took wine with every one present; he (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) told funny stories, and led the life himself with such a joyous peal that the man must have been a churl who could not have laughed for pure sympathy. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was a capital hand at speculation and vingt-et-un, and all the merry games, which kept the little circle round the cabin-lamp so deep in innocent amusement, that a hurricane might have howled overhead without their hearing it; but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) freely owned that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had no talent for whist, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) didn't know a knight from a castle upon the chess-board.

<p/>Indeed, Mr. Talboys was by no means too learned a gentleman. The pale governess had tried to talk to him (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) about fashionable literature, but George had only pulled his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) beard and stared very hard at her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), saying occasionally, <div class="bookquote">``Ah, yes, by Jove!''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>and <div class="bookquote">``To be sure, ah!''

 (<font color='red'><b>The lady</b></font>)</div><p/>The sentimental young lady, going home to finish her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) education, had tried him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) with Shelby and Byron, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Byron</b></font>) had fairly laughed in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) face, as if poetry were a joke. The woolstapler sounded him (<font color='blue'><b>Byron</b></font>) on politics, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Byron</b></font>) did not seem very deeply versed in them; so they let him (<font color='blue'><b>Byron</b></font>) go his (<font color='blue'><b>Byron</b></font>) own way, smoke his (<font color='blue'><b>Byron</b></font>) cigars and talk to the sailors, lounge over the bulwarks and stare at the water, and make himself agreeable to everybody in his (<font color='blue'><b>Byron</b></font>) own fashion. But when the Argus came to be within about a fortnight's sail of England everybody noticed a change in George Talboys. He (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) grew restless and fidgety; sometimes so merry that the cabin rung with his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) laughter; sometimes moody and thoughtful. Favorite as he (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) was among the sailors, they were tired at last of answering his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) perpetual questions about the probable time of touching land. Would it be in ten days, in eleven, in twelve, in thirteen? Was the wind favorable? How many knots an hour was the vessel doing? Then a sudden passion would seize him (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) would stamp upon the deck, crying out that she (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) was a rickety old craft, and that her (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) owners were swindlers to advertise her (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) as the fast-sailing Argus. She (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) was not fit for passenger traffic; she (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) was not fit to carry impatient living creatures, with hearts and souls; she (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) was fit for nothing but to be laden with bales of stupid wool, that might rot on the sea and be none the worse for it.

<p/>The sun was drooping down behind the waves as George Talboys lighted his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) cigar upon this August evening. Only ten days more, the sailors had told him (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) that afternoon, and they would see the English coast. <div class="bookquote">``I will go ashore in the first boat that hails us,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) cried; <div class="bookquote">``I will go ashore in a cockle-shell. By Jove, if it comes to that, I will swim to land.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) friends in the aft-cabin, with the exception of the pale governess, laughed at his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) impatience; she (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) sighed as she (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) watched the young man, chafing at the slow hours, pushing away his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) untasted wine, flinging himself restlessly about upon the cabin sofa, rushing up and down the companion ladder, and staring at the waves.

<p/>As the red rim of the sun dropped into the water, the governess ascended the cabin stairs for a stroll on deck, while the passengers sat over their wine below. She (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) stopped when she (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) came up to George, and, standing by his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) side, watched the fading crimson in the western sky.

<p/>The lady was very quiet and reserved, seldom sharing in the after-cabin amusements, never laughing, and speaking very little; but she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) and George Talboys had been excellent friends throughout the passage.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Does my cigar annoy you, Miss Morley?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) said, taking it out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) mouth.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not at all; pray do not leave off smoking. I only came up to look at the sunset. What a lovely evening!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, yes, I dare say,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) answered, impatiently; <div class="bookquote">``yet so long, so long! Ten more interminable days and ten more weary nights before we land.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Morley</b></font>)</div>said Miss Morley, sighing. <div class="bookquote">``Do you wish the time shorter?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do I?''  (<font color='red'><b>George/George Talboys/Mr. Talboys</b></font>)</div>cried George. <div class="bookquote">``Indeed I do. Don't you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Scarcely.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But is there no one you love in England? Is there no one you love looking out for your arrival?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope so,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Morley</b></font>) said gravely. They were silent for some time, he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) smoking his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) cigar with a furious impatience, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) could hasten the course of the vessel by his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) own restlessness; she (<font color='blue'><b>Morley</b></font>) looking out at the waning light with melancholy blue eyes--eyes that seemed to have faded with poring over closely-printed books and difficult needlework; eyes that had faded a little, perhaps, by reason of tears secretly shed in the lonely night.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``See!''  (<font color='red'><b>George/George Talboys/Mr. Talboys</b></font>)</div>said George, suddenly, pointing in another direction from that toward which Miss Morley was looking, <div class="bookquote">``there's the new moon!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Morley</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Morley</b></font>) looked up at the pale crescent, her (<font color='blue'><b>Morley</b></font>) own face almost as pale and wan.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This is the first time we have seen it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We must wish!''  (<font color='red'><b>George/George Talboys/Mr. Talboys</b></font>)</div>said George. <div class="bookquote">``I know what I wish.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That we may get home quickly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My wish is that we may find no disappointment when we get there,''  (<font color='red'><b>the governess</b></font>)</div>said the governess, sadly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Disappointment!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) started as if he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) had been struck, and asked what she (<font color='blue'><b>Morley</b></font>) meant by talking of disappointment.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I mean this,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Morley</b></font>) said, speaking rapidly, and with a restless motion of her (<font color='blue'><b>Morley</b></font>) thin hands; <div class="bookquote">``I mean that as the end of the voyage draws near, hope sinks in my heart; and a sick fear comes over me that at the last all may not be well. The person I go to meet may be changed in his (<font color='blue'><b>person</b></font>) feelings toward me; or he (<font color='blue'><b>person</b></font>) may retain all the old feeling until the moment of seeing me, and then lose it in a breath at sight of my poor wan face, for I was called a pretty girl, Mr. Talboys, when I sailed for Sydney, fifteen years ago; or he (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) may be so changed by the world as to have grown selfish and mercenary, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) may welcome me for the sake of my fifteen years' savings. Again, he (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) may be dead. He (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) may have been well, perhaps, up to within a week of our landing, and in that last week may have taken a fever, and died an hour before our vessel anchors in the Mersey. I think of all these things, Mr. Talboys, and act the scenes over in my mind, and feel the anguish of them twenty times a day. Twenty times a day,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Morley</b></font>) repeated; <div class="bookquote">``why I do it a thousand times a day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>George Talboys had stood motionless, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) cigar in his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) hand, listening to her (<font color='blue'><b>Morley</b></font>) so intently that, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Morley</b></font>) said the last words, his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) hold relaxed, and the cigar dropped in the water.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wonder,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Morley</b></font>) continued, more to herself than to him (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``I wonder, looking back, to think how hopeful I was when the vessel sailed; I never thought then of disappointment, but I pictured the joy of meeting, imagining the very words that would be said, the very tones, the very looks; but for this last month of the voyage, day by day, and hour by hour my heart sinks and my hopeful fancies fade away, and I dread the end as much as if I knew that I was going to England to attend a funeral.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>The young man suddenly changed his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) attitude, and turned his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face full upon his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) companion, with a look of alarm. She (<font color='blue'><b>Morley</b></font>) saw in the pale light that the color had faded from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cheek.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What a fool!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cried, striking his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) clenched fist upon the side of the vessel, <div class="bookquote">``what a fool I am to be frightened at this? Why do you come and say these things to me? Why do you come and terrify me out of my senses, when I am going straight home to the woman I love; to a girl whose heart is as true as the light of Heaven; and in whom I no more expect to find any change than I do to see another sun rise in to-morrow's sky? Why do you come and try to put such fancies in my head when I am going home to my darling wife?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Your wife,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Morley</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``that is different. There is no reason that my terrors should terrify you. I am going to England to rejoin a man to whom I was engaged to be married fifteen years ago. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was too poor to marry then, and when I was offered a situation as governess in a rich Australian family, I persuaded him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to let me accept it, so that I might leave him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) free and unfettered to win his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) way in the world, while I saved a little money to help us when we began life together. I never meant to stay away so long, but things have gone badly with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in England. That is my story, and you can understand my fears. They need not influence you. Mine is an exceptional case.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So is mine,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/George Talboys/Mr. Talboys</b></font>)</div>said George, impatiently. <div class="bookquote">``I tell you that mine is an exceptional case: although I swear to you that until this moment, I have never known a fear as to the result of my voyage home. But you are right; your terrors have nothing to do with me. You have been away fifteen years; all kinds of things may happen in fifteen years. Now it is only three years and a half this very month since I left England. What can have happened in such a short time as that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Morley</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Morley looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) with a mournful smile, but did not speak. His (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) feverish ardor, the freshness and impatience of his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) nature were so strange and new to her (<font color='blue'><b>Morley</b></font>), that she (<font color='blue'><b>Morley</b></font>) looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) half in admiration, half in pity.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My pretty little wife! My gentle, innocent, loving little wife! Do you know, Miss Morley,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) said, with all his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) old hopefulness of manner, <div class="bookquote">``that I left my little girl asleep, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Morley</b></font>) baby in her (<font color='blue'><b>Morley</b></font>) arms, and with nothing but a few blotted lines to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Morley</b></font>) why her (<font color='blue'><b>Morley</b></font>) faithful husband had deserted her (<font color='blue'><b>Morley</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Deserted her (<font color='blue'><b>Morley</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>the governess</b></font>)</div>exclaimed the governess.

<p/>``Yes. I was an ensign in a cavalry regiment when I first met my little darling. We were quartered at a stupid seaport town, where my pet lived with her (<font color='blue'><b>Morley</b></font>) shabby old father, a half-pay naval officer; a regular old humbug, as poor as Job, and with an eye for nothing but the main chance. I saw through all his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) shallow tricks to catch one of us for his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) pretty daughter. I saw all the pitiable, contemptible, palpable traps he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) set for us big dragoons to walk into. I saw through his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) shabby-genteel dinners and public-house port; his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) fine talk of the grandeur of his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) family; his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) sham pride and independence, and the sham tears of his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) bleared old eyes when he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) talked of his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) only child. He (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) was a drunken old hypocrite, and he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) was ready to sell my poor, little girl to the highest bidder. Luckily for me, I happened just then to be the highest bidder; for my father, is a rich man, Miss Morley, and as it was love at first sight on both sides, my darling and I made a match of it. No sooner, however, did my father hear that I had married a penniless little girl, the daughter of a tipsy old half-pay lieutenant, than he (<font color='blue'><b>lieutenant</b></font>) wrote me a furious letter, telling me he (<font color='blue'><b>lieutenant</b></font>) would never again hold any communication with me, and that my yearly allowance would stop from my wedding-day.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``As there was no remaining in such a regiment as mine, with nothing but my pay to live on, and my pretty little wife to keep, I sold out, thinking that before the money was exhausted, I should be sure to drop into something. I took my darling to Italy, and we lived there in splendid style as long as my two thousand pounds lasted; but when that began to dwindle down to a couple of hundred or so, we came back to England, and as my darling had a fancy for being near that tiresome old father of hers, we settled at the watering-place where he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) lived. Well, as soon as the old man heard that I had a couple of hundred pounds left, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) expressed a wonderful degree of affection for us, and insisted on our boarding in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) house. We consented, still to please my darling, who had just then a peculiar right to have every whim and fancy of her (<font color='blue'><b>We</b></font>) innocent heart indulged. We did board with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and finally he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fleeced us; but when I spoke of it to my little wife, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) only shrugged her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) shoulders, and said she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) did not like to be unkind to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) `poor papa.''  (<font color='red'><b>papa</b></font>)</div>So poor papa made away with our little stock of money in no time; and as I felt that it was now becoming necessary to look about for something, I ran up to London, and tried to get a situation as a clerk in a merchant's office, or as accountant, or book-keeper, or something of that kind. But I suppose there was the stamp of a heavy dragoon about me, for do what I would I couldn't get anybody to believe in my capacity; and tired out, and down-hearted, I returned to my darling, to find her (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>) nursing a son and heir to his (<font color='blue'><b>heir</b></font>) father's poverty. Poor little girl, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was very low-spirited; and when I told her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) that my London expedition had failed, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) fairly broke down, and burst in to a storm of sobs and lamentations, telling me that I ought not to have married her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) if I could give her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) nothing but poverty and misery; and that I had done her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) a cruel wrong in making her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) my wife. By heaven! Miss Morley, her (<font color='blue'><b>Morley</b></font>) tears and reproaches drove me almost mad; and I flew into a rage with her (<font color='blue'><b>Morley</b></font>), myself, her (<font color='blue'><b>Morley</b></font>) father, the world, and everybody in it, and then ran out of the house. I walked about the streets all that day, half out of my mind, and with a strong inclination to throw myself into the sea, so as to leave my poor girl free to make a better match. <div class="bookquote">``If I drown myself, her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) father must support her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I thought; `the old hypocrite could never refuse her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) a shelter; but while I live she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) has no claim on him (<font color='blue'><b>hypocrite</b></font>).'' I went down to a rickety old wooden pier, meaning to wait there till it was dark, and then drop quietly over the end of it into the water; but while I sat there smoking my pipe, and staring vacantly at the sea-gulls, two men came down, and one of them began to talk of the Australian gold-diggings, and the great things that were to be done there. It appeared that he (<font color='blue'><b>hypocrite</b></font>) was going to sail in a day or two, and he (<font color='blue'><b>hypocrite</b></font>) was trying to persuade his (<font color='blue'><b>hypocrite</b></font>) companion to join him (<font color='blue'><b>hypocrite</b></font>) in the expedition.

<p/>``I listened to these men for upward of an hour, following them up and down the pier, with my pipe in my mouth, and hearing all their talk. After this I fell into conversation with them myself, and ascertained that there was a vessel going to leave Liverpool in three days, by which vessel one of the men was going out. This man gave me all the information I required, and told me, moreover, that a stalwart young fellow, such as I was, could hardly fail to do well in the diggings. The thought flashed upon me so suddenly, that I grew hot and red in the face, and trembled in every limb with excitement. This was better than the water, at any rate. Suppose I stole away from my darling, leaving her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) safe under her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) father's roof, and went and made a fortune in the new world, and came back in a twelvemonth to throw it into her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lap; for I was so sanguine in those days that I counted on making my fortune in a year or so. I thanked the man for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) information, and late at night strolled homeward. It was bitter winter weather, but I had been too full of passion to feel cold, and I walked through the quiet streets, with the snow drifting in my face, and a desperate hopefulness in my heart. The old man was sitting drinking brandy-and-water in the little dining-room; and my wife was up-stairs, sleeping peacefully, with the baby on her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) breast. I sat down and wrote a few brief lines, which told her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) that I never had loved her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) better than now, when I seemed to desert her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>); that I was going to try my fortune in the new world, and that if I succeeded I should come back to bring her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) plenty and happiness; but that if I failed I should never look upon her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) face again. I divided the remainder of our money--something over forty pounds--into two equal portions, leaving one for her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), and putting the other in my pocket. I knelt down and prayed for my wife and child, with my head upon the white counterpane that covered them. I wasn't much of a praying man at ordinary times, but God knows that was a heartfelt prayer. I kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) once, and the baby once, and then crept out of the room. The dining-room door was open, and the old man was nodding over his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) paper. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) looked up as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) heard my step in the passage, and asked me where I was going. ``To have a smoke in the street,<div class="bookquote">'' I answered; and as this was a common habit of mine he (<font color='blue'><b>hypocrite</b></font>) believed me. Three nights after I was out at sea, bound for Melbourne--a steerage passenger, with a digger's tools for my baggage, and about seven shillings in my pocket.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you succeeded?''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Morley</b></font>)</div>asked Miss Morley.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not till I had long despaired of success; not until poverty and I had become such old companions and bed-fellows, that looking back at my past life, I wondered whether that dashing, reckless, extravagant, luxurious, champagne-drinking dragoon could have really been the same man who sat on the damp ground gnawing a moldy crust in the wilds of the new world. I clung to the memory of my darling, and the trust that I had in her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) love and truth was the one keystone that kept the fabric of my past life together--the one star that lit the thick black darkness of the future. I was hail-fellow-well-met with bad men; I was in the center of riot, drunkenness, and debauchery; but the purifying influence of my love kept me safe from all. Thin and gaunt, the half-starved shadow of what I once had been, I saw myself one day in a broken bit of looking-glass, and was frightened by my own face. But I toiled on through all; through disappointment and despair, rheumatism, fever, starvation; at the very gates of death, I toiled on steadily to the end; and in the end I conquered.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>passenger</b></font>) was so brave in his (<font color='blue'><b>passenger</b></font>) energy and determination, in his (<font color='blue'><b>passenger</b></font>) proud triumph of success, and in the knowledge of the difficulties he (<font color='blue'><b>passenger</b></font>) had vanquished, that the pale governess could only look at him (<font color='blue'><b>passenger</b></font>) in wondering admiration.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How brave you were!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Morley</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Brave!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>passenger</b></font>) cried, with a joyous peal of laughter; <div class="bookquote">``wasn't I working for my darling? Through all the dreary time of that probation, her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) pretty white hand seemed beckoning me onward to a happy future! Why, I have seen her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) under my wretched canvas tent sitting by my side, with her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) boy in her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) arms, as plainly as I had ever seen her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) in the one happy year of our wedded life. At last, one dreary foggy morning, just three months ago, with a drizzling rain wetting me to the skin, up to my neck in clay and mire, half-starved, enfeebled by fever, stiff with rheumatism, a monster nugget turned up under my spade, and I was in one minute the richest man in Australia. I fell down on the wet clay, with my lump of gold in the bosom of my shirt, and, for the first time in my life, cried like a child. I traveled post-haste to Sydney, realized my price, which was worth upward of #20,000, and a fortnight afterward took my passage for England in this vessel; and in ten days--in ten days I shall see my darling.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But in all that time did you never write to your wife?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never, till the night before I left Sydney. I could not write when everything looked so black. I could not write and tell her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) that I was fighting hard with despair and death. I waited for better fortune, and when that came I wrote telling her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) that I should be in England almost as soon as my letter, and giving her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) an address at a coffee-house in London where she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) could write to me, telling me where to find her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), though she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) is hardly likely to have left her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) father's house.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>passenger</b></font>) fell into a reverie after this, and puffed meditatively at his (<font color='blue'><b>passenger</b></font>) cigar. His (<font color='blue'><b>passenger</b></font>) companion did not disturb him (<font color='blue'><b>passenger</b></font>). The last ray of summer daylight had died out, and the pale light of the crescent moon only remained.

<p/>Presently George Talboys flung away his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) cigar, and turning to the governess, cried abruptly, <div class="bookquote">``Miss Morley, if, when I get to England, I hear that anything has happened to my wife, I shall fall down dead.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the governess</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear Mr. Talboys, why do you think of these things? God is very good to us; He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) will not afflict us beyond our power of endurance. I see all things, perhaps, in a melancholy light; for the long monotony of my life has given me too much time to think over my troubles.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And my life has been all action, privation, toil, alternate hope and despair; I have had no time to think upon the chances of anything happening to my darling.

Three years and a half and not one line--one word from her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>), or from any mortal creature who knows her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>). Heaven above! what may not have happened?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>In the agitation of his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) mind he (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) began to walk rapidly up and down the lonely deck, the governess following, and trying to soothe him (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I swear to you, Miss Morley,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``that till you spoke to me to-night, I never felt one shadow of fear, and now I have that sick, sinking dread at my heart which you talked of an hour ago. Let me alone, please, to get over it my own way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) drew silently away from him (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>), and seated herself by the side of the vessel, looking over into the water.

<p/>George Talboys walked backward and forward for some time, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) head bent upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) breast, looking neither to the right nor the left, but in about a quarter of an hour he (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) returned to the spot where the governess was seated.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have been praying,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) said--<div class="bookquote">``praying for my darling.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) spoke in a voice little above a whisper, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) saw his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) face ineffably calm in the moonlight.

<p/>CHAPTER III.

<p/>HIDDEN RELICS.

<p/>The same August sun which had gone down behind the waste of waters glimmered redly upon the broad face of the old clock over that ivy-covered archway which leads into the gardens of Audley Court.

<p/>A fierce and crimson sunset. The mullioned windows and twinkling lattices are all ablaze with the red glory; the fading light flickers upon the leaves of the limes in the long avenue, and changes the still fish-pond into a sheet of burnished copper; even into those dim recesses of brier and brushwood, amidst which the old well is hidden, the crimson brightness penetrates in fitful flashes till the dank weeds and the rusty iron wheel and broken woodwork seem as if they were flecked with blood.

<p/>The lowing of a cow in the quiet meadows, the splash of a trout in the fish-pond, the last notes of a tired bird, the creaking of wagon-wheels upon the distant road, every now and then breaking the evening silence, only made the stillness of the place seem more intense. It was almost oppressive, this twilight stillness. The very repose of the place grew painful from its intensity, and you felt as if a corpse must be lying somewhere within that gray and ivy-covered pile of building--so deathlike was the tranquillity of all around.

<p/>As the clock over the archway struck eight, a door at the back of the house was softly opened, and a girl came out into the gardens.

<p/>But even the presence of a human being scarcely broke the silence; for the girl crept slowly over the thick grass, and gliding into the avenue by the side of the fish-pond, disappeared in the rich shelter of the limes.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was not, perhaps, positively a pretty girl; but her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) appearance was of that order which is commonly called interesting. Interesting, it may be, because in the pale face and the light gray eyes, the small features and compressed lips, there was something which hinted at a power of repression and self-control not common in a woman of nineteen or twenty. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) might have been pretty, I think, but for the one fault in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) small oval face. This fault was an absence of color. Not one tinge of crimson flushed the waxen whiteness of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) cheeks; not one shadow of brown redeemed the pale insipidity of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) eyebrows and eyelashes; not one glimmer of gold or auburn relieved the dull flaxen of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hair. Even her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) dress was spoiled by this same deficiency. The pale lavender muslin faded into a sickly gray, and the ribbon knotted round her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) throat melted into the same neutral hue.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) figure was slim and fragile, and in spite of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) humble dress, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had something of the grace and carriage of a gentlewoman, but she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was only a simple country girl, called Phoebe Marks, who had been nursemaid in Mr. Dawson's family, and whom Lady Audley had chosen for her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) maid after her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) marriage with Sir Michael.

<p/>Of course, this was a wonderful piece of good fortune for Phoebe, who found her (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) wages trebled and her (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) work lightened in the well-ordered household at the Court; and who was therefore quite as much the object of envy among her (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) particular friends as my lady herself to higher circles.

<p/>A man, who was sitting on the broken wood-work of the well, started as the lady's-maid came out of the dim shade of the limes and stood before him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) among the weeds and brushwood.

<p/>I have said before that this was a neglected spot; it lay in the midst of a low shrubbery, hidden away from the rest of the gardens, and only visible from the garret windows at the back of the west wing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, Phoebe,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the man, shutting a clasp-knife with which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had been stripping the bark from a blackthorn stake, <div class="bookquote">``you came upon me so still and sudden, that I thought you was an evil spirit. I've come across through the fields, and come in here at the gate agen the moat, and I was taking a rest before I came up to the house to ask if you was come back.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can see the well from my bedroom window, Luke,''  (<font color='red'><b>Phoebe/Phoebe Marks/PHOEBE</b></font>)</div>Phoebe answered, pointing to an open lattice in one of the gables. <div class="bookquote">``I saw you sitting here, and came down to have a chat; it's better talking out here than in the house, where there's always somebody listening.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div><p/>The man was a big, broad-shouldered, stupid-looking clod-hopper of about twenty-three years of age. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) dark red hair grew low upon his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) forehead, and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) bushy brows met over a pair of greenish gray eyes; his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) nose was large and well-shaped, but the mouth was coarse in form and animal in expression. Rosy-cheeked, red-haired, and bull-necked, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was not unlike one of the stout oxen grazing in the meadows round about the Court.

<p/>The girl seated herself lightly upon the wood-work at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) side, and put one of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) hands, which had grown white in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) new and easy service, about his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thick neck.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you glad to see me, Luke?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course I'm glad, lass,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) answered, boorishly, opening his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knife again, and scraping away at the hedge-stake.

<p/>They were first cousins, and had been play fellows in childhood, and sweethearts in early youth.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't seem much as if you were glad,''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>said the girl; <div class="bookquote">``you might look at me, Luke, and tell me if you think my journey has improved me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It ain't put any color into your cheeks, my girl,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said, glancing up at her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) from under his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lowering eyebrows; <div class="bookquote">``you're every bit as white as you was when you went away.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But they say traveling makes people genteel, Luke. I've been on the Continent with my lady, through all manner of curious places; and you know, when I was a child, Squire Horton's daughters taught me to speak a little French, and I found it so nice to be able to talk to the people abroad.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Genteel!''  (<font color='red'><b>Luke/Luke Marks/Mr. Marks</b></font>)</div>cried Luke Marks, with a hoarse laugh; <div class="bookquote">``who wants you to be genteel, I wonder? Not me, for one; when you're my wife you won't have overmuch time for gentility, my girl. French, too! Dang me, Phoebe, I suppose when we've saved money enough between us to buy a bit of a farm, you'll be parleyvooing to the cows?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Luke/Luke Marks/Mr. Marks</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) bit her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) lip as her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) lover spoke, and looked away. He (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) went on cutting and chopping at a rude handle he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) was fashioning to the stake, whistling softly to himself all the while, and not once looking at his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) cousin.

<p/>For some time they were silent, but by-and-by she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) said, with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) face still turned away from her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) companion:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What a fine thing it is for Miss Graham that was, to travel with her (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) maid and her (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) courier, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) chariot and four, and a husband that thinks there isn't one spot upon all the earth that's good enough for her (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) to set her (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) foot upon!''

 (<font color='red'><b>companion</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, it is a fine thing, Phoebe, to have lots of money,''  (<font color='red'><b>Luke/Luke Marks/Mr. Marks</b></font>)</div>answered Luke, <div class="bookquote">``and I hope you'll be warned by that, my lass, to save up your wages agin we get married.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Luke/Luke Marks/Mr. Marks</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, what was she (<font color='blue'><b>lass</b></font>) in Mr. Dawson's house only three months ago?''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>continued the girl, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had not heard her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) cousin's speech. <div class="bookquote">``What was she (<font color='blue'><b>lass</b></font>) but a servant like me? Taking wages and working for them as hard, or harder, than I did. You should have seen her (<font color='blue'><b>lass</b></font>) shabby clothes, Luke--worn and patched, and darned and turned and twisted, yet always looking nice upon her (<font color='blue'><b>lass</b></font>), somehow. She (<font color='blue'><b>lass</b></font>) gives me more as lady's-maid here than ever she (<font color='blue'><b>lass</b></font>) got from Mr. Dawson then. Why, I've seen her (<font color='blue'><b>lass</b></font>) come out of the parlor with a few sovereigns and a little silver in her (<font color='blue'><b>lass</b></font>) hand, that master had just given her (<font color='blue'><b>lass</b></font>) for her (<font color='blue'><b>lass</b></font>) quarter's salary; and now look at her (<font color='blue'><b>lass</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never you mind her (<font color='blue'><b>lass</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Luke/Luke Marks/Mr. Marks</b></font>)</div>said Luke; <div class="bookquote">``take care of yourself, Phoebe; that's all you've got to do. What should you say to a public-house for you and me, by-and-by, my girl? There's a deal of money to be made out of a public-house.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Luke/Luke Marks/Mr. Marks</b></font>)</div><p/>The girl still sat with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) face averted from her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) lover, her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) hands hanging listlessly in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) lap, and her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) pale gray eyes fixed upon the last low streak of crimson dying out behind the trunks of the trees.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You should see the inside of the house, Luke,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``it's a tumbledown looking place enough outside; but you should see my lady's rooms--all pictures and gilding, and great looking-glasses that stretch from the ceiling to the floor. Painted ceilings, too, that cost hundreds of pounds, the housekeeper told her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>), and all done for her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>)'s a lucky one,''  (<font color='red'><b>Luke/Luke Marks/Mr. Marks</b></font>)</div>muttered Luke, with lazy indifference.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You should have seen her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) while we were abroad, with a crowd of gentlemen hanging about her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>); Sir Michael not jealous of them, only proud to see her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) so much admired. You should have heard her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) laugh and talk with them; throwing all their compliments and fine speeches back at them, as it were, as if they had been pelting her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) with roses. She (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) set everybody mad about her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>), wherever she (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) went. Her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) singing, her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) playing, her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) painting, her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) dancing, her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) beautiful smile, and sunshiny ringlets! She (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) was always the talk of a place, as long as we stayed in it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is she (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) at home to-night?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; she (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) has gone out with Sir Michael to a dinner party at the Beeches. They've seven or eight miles to drive, and they won't be back till after eleven.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then I'll tell you what, Phoebe, if the inside of the house is so mighty fine, I should like to have a look at it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You shall, then. Mrs. Barton, the housekeeper, knows you by sight, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>) can't object to my showing you some of the best rooms.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the cousins</b></font>)</div><p/>It was almost dark when the cousins left the shrubbery and walked slowly to the house. The door by which they entered led into the servants' hall, on one side of which was the housekeeper's room. Phoebe Marks stopped for a moment to ask the housekeeper if she (<font color='blue'><b>Marks</b></font>) might take her (<font color='blue'><b>Marks</b></font>) cousin through some of the rooms, and having received permission to do so, lighted a candle at the lamp in the hall, and beckoned to Luke to follow her (<font color='blue'><b>Marks</b></font>) into the other part of the house.

<p/>The long, black oak corridors were dim in the ghostly twilight--the light carried by Phoebe looking only a poor speck in the broad passages through which the girl led her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) cousin. Luke looked suspiciously over his (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) shoulder now and then, half-frightened by the creaking of his (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) own hob-nailed boots.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's a mortal dull place, Phoebe,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) said, as they emerged from a passage into the principal hall, which was not yet lighted; <div class="bookquote">``I've heard tell of a murder that was done here in old times.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There are murders enough in these times, as to that, Luke,''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>answered the girl, ascending the staircase, followed by the young man.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) led the way through a great drawing-room, rich in satin and ormolu, buhl and inlaid cabinets, bronzes, cameos, statuettes, and trinkets, that glistened in the dusky light; then through a morning room, hung with proof engravings of valuable pictures; through this into an ante-chamber, where she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) stopped, holding the light above her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) head.

<p/>The young man stared about him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), open-mouthed and open-eyed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's a rare fine place,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``and must have cost a heap of money.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Look at the pictures on the walls,''  (<font color='red'><b>Phoebe/Phoebe Marks/PHOEBE</b></font>)</div>said Phoebe, glancing at the panels of the octagonal chamber, which were hung with Claudes and Poussins, Wouvermans and Cuyps. <div class="bookquote">``I've heard that those alone are worth a fortune. This is the entrance to my lady's apartments, Miss Graham that was.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) lifted a heavy green cloth curtain which hung across a doorway, and led the astonished countryman into a fairy-like boudoir, and thence to a dressing-room, in which the open doors of a wardrobe and a heap of dresses flung about a sofa showed that it still remained exactly as its occupants had left it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've got all these things to put away before my lady comes home, Luke; you might sit down here while I do it, I shan't be long.''

 (<font color='red'><b>cousin</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) cousin looked around in gawky embarrassment, bewildered by the splendor of the room; and after some deliberation selected the most substantial of the chairs, on the extreme edge of which he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) carefully seated himself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish I could show you the jewels, Luke,''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>said the girl; <div class="bookquote">``but I can't, for she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) always keeps the keys herself; that's the case on the dressing-table there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What, that?''  (<font color='red'><b>Luke/Luke Marks/Mr. Marks</b></font>)</div>cried Luke, staring at the massive walnut-wood and brass inlaid casket. <div class="bookquote">``Why, that's big enough to hold every bit of clothes I've got!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And it's as full as it can be of diamonds, rubies, pearls and emeralds,''  (<font color='red'><b>Phoebe/Phoebe Marks/PHOEBE</b></font>)</div>answered Phoebe, busy as she (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) spoke in folding the rustling silk dresses, and laying them one by one upon the shelves of the wardrobe. As she (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) was shaking out the flounces of the last, a jingling sound caught her (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) ear, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) put her (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) hand into the pocket.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I declare!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) exclaimed, <div class="bookquote">``my lady has left her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) keys in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) pocket for once in a way; I can show you the jewelry, if you like, Luke.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I may as well have a look at it, my girl,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) said, rising from his (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) chair and holding the light while his (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) cousin unlocked the casket. He (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) uttered a cry of wonder when he (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) saw the ornaments glittering on white satin cushions. He (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) wanted to handle the delicate jewels; to pull them about, and find out their mercantile value. Perhaps a pang of longing and envy shot through his (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) heart as he (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) thought how he (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) would have liked to have taken one of them.

<p/>``Why, one of those diamond things would set us up in life, Phoebe, he (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) said, turning a bracelet over and over in his (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) big red hands.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Put it down, Luke! Put it down directly!''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>cried the girl, with a look of terror; <div class="bookquote">``how can you speak about such things?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) laid the bracelet in its place with a reluctant sigh, and then continued his (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) examination of the casket.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What's this?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) asked presently, pointing to a brass knob in the frame-work of the box.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) pushed it as he (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) spoke, and a secret drawer, lined with purple velvet, flew out of the casket.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Look ye here!''  (<font color='red'><b>Luke/Luke Marks/Mr. Marks</b></font>)</div>cried Luke, pleased at his (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) discovery.

<p/>Phoebe Marks threw down the dress she (<font color='blue'><b>Marks</b></font>) had been folding, and went over to the toilette table.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, I never saw this before,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Marks</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``I wonder what there is in it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>There was not much in it; neither gold nor gems; only a baby's little worsted shoe rolled up in a piece of paper, and a tiny lock of pale and silky yellow hair, evidently taken from a baby's head. Phoebe's eyes dilated as she (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) examined the little packet.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So this is what my lady hides in the secret drawer,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) muttered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's queer rubbish to keep in such a place,''  (<font color='red'><b>Luke/Luke Marks/Mr. Marks</b></font>)</div>said Luke, carelessly.

<p/>The girl's thin lip curved into a curious smile.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You will bear me witness where I found this,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) said, putting the little parcel into her (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) pocket.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, Phoebe, you're not going to be such a fool as to take that,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>cried the young man.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'd rather have this than the diamond bracelet you would have liked to take,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) answered; <div class="bookquote">``you shall have the public house, Luke.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER IV.

<p/>IN THE FIRST PAGE OF <div class="bookquote">``THE TIMES.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div><p/>Robert Audley was supposed to be a barrister. As a barrister was his (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) name inscribed in the law-list; as a barrister he (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) had chambers in Figtree Court, Temple; as a barrister he (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) had eaten the allotted number of dinners, which form the sublime ordeal through which the forensic aspirant wades on to fame and fortune. If these things can make a man a barrister, Robert Audley decidedly was one. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) had never either had a brief, or tried to get a brief, or even wished to have a brief in all those five years, during which his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) name had been painted upon one of the doors in Figtree Court. He (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) was a handsome, lazy, care-for-nothing fellow, of about seven-and-twenty; the only son of a younger brother of Sir Michael Audley. His (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) father had left him (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) #400 a year, which his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) friends had advised him (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) to increase by being called to the bar; and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) found it, after due consideration, more trouble to oppose the wishes of these friends than to eat so many dinners, and to take a set of chambers in the Temple, he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) adopted the latter course, and unblushingly called himself a barrister.

<p/>Sometimes, when the weather was very hot, and he (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) had exhausted himself with the exertion of smoking his (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) German pipe, and reading French novels, he (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) would stroll into the Temple Gardens, and lying in some shady spot, pale and cool, with his (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) shirt collar turned down and a blue silk handkerchief tied loosely about his (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) neck, would tell grave benchers that he (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) had knocked himself up with over work.

<p/>The sly old benchers laughed at the pleasant fiction; but they all agreed that Robert Audley was a good fellow; a generous-hearted fellow; rather a curious fellow, too, with a fund of sly wit and quiet humor, under his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) listless, dawdling, indifferent, irresolute manner. A man who would never get on in the world; but who would not hurt a worm. Indeed, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) chambers were converted into a perfect dog-kennel, by his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) habit of bringing home stray and benighted curs, who were attracted by his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) looks in the street, and followed him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) with abject fondness.

<p/>Robert always spent the hunting season at Audley Court; not that he (<font color='blue'><b>Court</b></font>) was distinguished as a Nimrod, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Court</b></font>) would quietly trot to covert upon a mild-tempered, stout-limbed bay hack, and keep at a very respectful distance from the hard riders; his (<font color='blue'><b>Court</b></font>) horse knowing quite as well as he (<font color='blue'><b>Court</b></font>) did, that nothing was further from his (<font color='blue'><b>Court</b></font>) thoughts than any desire to be in at the death.

<p/>The young man was a great favorite with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) uncle, and by no means despised by his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pretty, gipsy-faced, light-hearted, hoydenish cousin, Miss Alicia Audley. It might have seemed to other men, that the partiality of a young lady who was sole heiress to a very fine estate, was rather well worth cultivating, but it did not so occur to Robert Audley. Alicia was a very nice girl, he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) said, a jolly girl, with no nonsense about her (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>)--a girl of a thousand; but this was the highest point to which enthusiasm could carry him (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>). The idea of turning his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) cousin's girlish liking for him (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) to some good account never entered his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) idle brain. I doubt if he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) even had any correct notion of the amount of his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) uncle's fortune, and I am certain that he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) never for one moment calculated upon the chances of any part of that fortune ultimately coming to himself. So that when, one fine spring morning, about three months before the time of which I am writing, the postman brought him (<font color='blue'><b>postman</b></font>) the wedding cards of Sir Michael and Lady Audley, together with a very indignant letter from his (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) cousin, setting forth how her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) father had just married a wax-dollish young person, no older than Alicia herself, with flaxen ringlets, and a perpetual giggle; for I am sorry to say that Miss Audley's animus caused her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) thus to describe that pretty musical laugh which had been so much admired in the late Miss Lucy Graham--when, I say, these documents reached Robert Audley--they elicited neither vexation nor astonishment in the lymphatic nature of that gentleman. He (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) read Alicia's angry crossed and recrossed letter without so much as removing the amber mouth-piece of his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) German pipe from his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) mustached lips. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) had finished the perusal of the epistle, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) read with his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) dark eyebrows elevated to the center of his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) forehead -LRB-his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) only manner of expressing surprise, by the way-RRB- he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) deliberately threw that and the wedding cards into the waste-paper basket, and putting down his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) pipe, prepared himself for the exertion of thinking out the subject.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I always said the old buffer would marry,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) muttered, after about half an hour's revery. Alicia and my lady, the stepmother, will go at it hammer and tongs. I hope they won't quarrel in the hunting season, or say unpleasant things to each other at the dinner-table; rows always upset a man's digestion.

<p/>At about twelve o'clock on the morning following that night upon which the events recorded in my last chapter had taken place, the baronet's nephew strolled out of the Temple, Blackfriarsward, on his (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) way to the city. He (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) had in an evil hour obliged some necessitous friend by putting the ancient name of Audley across a bill of accommodation, which bill not having been provided for by the drawer, Robert was called upon to pay. For this purpose he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) sauntered up Ludgate Hill, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) blue necktie fluttering in the hot August air, and thence to a refreshingly cool banking-house in a shady court out of St. Paul's churchyard, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) made arrangements for selling out a couple of hundred pounds' worth of consols.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) had transacted this business, and was loitering at the corner of the court, waiting for a chance hansom to convey him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) back to the Temple, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was almost knocked down by a man of about his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) own age, who dashed headlong into the narrow opening.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Be so good as to look where you're going, my friend!''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>Robert remonstrated, mildly, to the impetuous passenger; <div class="bookquote">``you might give a man warning before you throw him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) down and trample upon him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>the passenger</b></font>)</div><p/>The stranger stopped suddenly, looked very hard at the speaker, and then gasped for breath.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Bob!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) cried, in a tone expressive of the most intense astonishment; <div class="bookquote">``I only touched British ground after dark last night, and to think that I should meet you this morning.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I've seen you somewhere before, my bearded friend,''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Audley, calmly scrutinizing the animated face of the other, <div class="bookquote">``but I'll be hanged if I can remember when or where.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What!''  (<font color='red'><b>the stranger</b></font>)</div>exclaimed the stranger, reproachfully. <div class="bookquote">``You don't mean to say that you've forgotten George Talboys?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No I have not!''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>said Robert, with an emphasis by no means usual to him (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>); and then hooking his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) arm into that of his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) friend, he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) led him (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) into the shady court, saying, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) old indifference, <div class="bookquote">``and now, George tell us all about it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>George Talboys did tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) all about it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) told that very story which he (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) had related ten days before to the pale governess on board the Argus; and then, hot and breathless, he (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) said that he (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) had twenty thousand pounds or so in his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) pocket, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) wanted to bank it at Messrs. ----, who had been his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) bankers many years before.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you'll believe me, I've only just left their counting-house,''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>said Robert. <div class="bookquote">``I'll go back with you, and we'll settle that matter in five minutes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They did contrive to settle it in about a quarter of an hour; and then Robert Audley was for starting off immediately for the Crown and Scepter, at Greenwich, or the Castle, at Richmond, where they could have a bit of dinner, and talk over those good old times when they were together at Eton. But George told his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) friend that before he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) went anywhere, before he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) shaved or broke his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) fast, or in any way refreshed himself after a night journey from Liverpool by express train, he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) must call at a certain coffee-house in Bridge street, Westminster, where he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) expected to find a letter from his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) wife.

<p/>As they dashed through Ludgate Hill, Fleet street, and the Strand, in a fast hansom, George Talboys poured into his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) friend's ear all those wild hopes and dreams which had usurped such a dominion over his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) sanguine nature.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall take a villa on the banks of the Thames, Bob,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``for the little wife and myself; and we'll have a yacht, Bob, old boy, and you shall lie on the deck and smoke, while my pretty one plays her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) guitar and sings songs to us. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)'s for all the world like one of those what's-its-names, who got poor old Ulysses into trouble,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>added the young man, whose classic lore was not very great.

<p/>The waiters at the Westminster coffee-house stared at the hollow-eyed, unshaven stranger, with his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) clothes of colonial cut, and his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) boisterous, excited manner; but he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) had been an old frequenter of the place in his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) military days, and when they heard who he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) was they flew to do his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) bidding.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) did not want much--only a bottle of soda-water, and to know if there was a letter at the bar directed to George Talboys.

<p/>The waiter brought the soda-water before the young men had seated themselves in a shady box near the disused fire-place. No; there was no letter for that name.

<p/>The waiter said it with consummate indifference, while he (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) mechanically dusted the little mahogany table.

<p/>George's face blanched to a deadly whiteness. <div class="bookquote">``Talboys,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``perhaps you didn't hear the name distinctly--T, A, L, B, O, Y, S. Go and look again, there must be a letter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The waiter shrugged his (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) shoulders as he (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) left the room, and returned in three minutes to say that there was no name at all resembling Talboys in the letter rack. There was Brown, and Sanderson, and Pinchbeck; only three letters altogether.

<p/>The young man drank his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) soda-water in silence, and then, leaning his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) elbows on the table, covered his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hands. There was something in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) manner which told Robert Audley that his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) disappointment, trifling as it may appear, was in reality a very bitter one. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) seated himself opposite to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) friend, but did not attempt to address him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).

<p/>By-and-by George looked up, and mechanically taking a greasy Times newspaper of the day before from a heap of journals on the table, stared vacantly at the first page.

<p/>I cannot tell how long he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) sat blankly staring at one paragraph among the list of deaths, before his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) dazed brain took in its full meaning; but after considerable pause he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) pushed the newspaper over to Robert Audley, and with a face that had changed from its dark bronze to a sickly, chalky grayish white, and with an awful calmness in his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) manner, he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) pointed with his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) finger to a line which ran thus:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``On the 24th inst., at Ventnor, Isle of Wight, Helen Talboys, aged 22.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER V.

<p/>THE HEADSTONE AT VENTNOR.

<p/>Yes, there it was in black and white--<div class="bookquote">``Helen Talboys, aged 22.''

 (<font color='red'><b>George/George Talboys/Mr. Talboys</b></font>)</div><p/>When George told the governess on board the Argus that if he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) heard any evil tidings of his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) wife he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) should drop down dead, he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) spoke in perfect good faith; and yet, here were the worst tidings that could come to him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) sat rigid, white and helpless, staring stupidly at the shocked face of his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) friend.

<p/>The suddenness of the blow had stunned him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>). In this strange and bewildered state of mind he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) began to wonder what had happened, and why it was that one line in the Times newspaper could have so horrible an effect upon him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>).

<p/>Then by degrees even this vague consciousness of his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) misfortune faded slowly out of his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) mind, succeeded by a painful consciousness of external things.

<p/>The hot August sunshine, the dusty window-panes and shabby-painted blinds, a file of fly-blown play-bills fastened to the wall, the black and empty fire-places, a bald-headed old man nodding over the Morning Advertizer, the slip-shod waiter folding a tumbled table-cloth, and Robert Audley's handsome face looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) full of compassionate alarm--he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) knew that all these things took gigantic proportions, and then, one by one, melted into dark blots and swam before his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) eyes, He (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) knew that there was a great noise, as of half a dozen furious steam-engines tearing and grinding in his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) ears, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) knew nothing more--except that somebody or something fell heavily to the ground.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) eyes upon the dusky evening in a cool and shaded room, the silence only broken by the rumbling of wheels at a distance.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) looked about him (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) wonderingly, but half indifferently. His (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) old friend, Robert Audley, was seated by his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) side smoking. George was lying on a low iron bedstead opposite to an open window, in which there was a stand of flowers and two or three birds in cages.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't mind the pipe, do you, George?''  (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div>his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) friend asked, quietly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) lay for some time looking at the flowers and the birds; one canary was singing a shrill hymn to the setting sun.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do the birds annoy you, George? Shall I take them out of the room?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; I like to hear them sing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div><p/>Robert Audley knocked the ashes out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) pipe, laid the precious meerschaum tenderly upon the mantelpiece, and going into the next room, returned presently with a cup of strong tea.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Take this, George,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) said, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) placed the cup on a little table close to George's pillow; <div class="bookquote">``it will do your head good.''

 (<font color='red'><b>George/George Talboys/Mr. Talboys</b></font>)</div><p/>The young man did not answer, but looked slowly round the room, and then at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) friend's grave face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Bob,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``where are we?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In my chambers, dear boy, in the Temple. You have no lodgings of your own, so you may as well stay with me while you're in town.''

 (<font color='red'><b>George/George Talboys/Mr. Talboys</b></font>)</div><p/>George passed his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) hand once or twice across his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) forehead, and then, in a hesitating manner, said, quietly:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That newspaper this morning, Bob; what was it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>George/George Talboys/Mr. Talboys</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never mind just now, old boy; drink some tea.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/George Talboys/Mr. Talboys</b></font>)</div>cried George, impatiently, raising himself upon the bed, and staring about him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) with hollow eyes. <div class="bookquote">``I remember all about it. Helen! my Helen! my wife, my darling, my only love! Dead, dead!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``George,''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>said Robert Audley, laying his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) hand gently upon the young man's arm, <div class="bookquote">``you must remember that the person whose name you saw in the paper may not be your wife. There may have been some other Helen Talboys.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) cried; <div class="bookquote">``the age corresponds with hers, and Talboys is such an uncommon name.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It may be a misprint for Talbot.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no, no; my wife is dead!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) shook off Robert's restraining hand, and rising from the bed, walked straight to the door.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where are you going?''  (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div>exclaimed his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) friend.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``To Ventnor, to see her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) grave.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not to-night, George, not to-night. I will go with you myself by the first train to-morrow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div><p/>Robert led him (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) back to the bed, and gently forced him (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) to lie down again. He (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) then gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) an opiate, which had been left for him (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) by the medical man whom they had called in at the coffee-house in Bridge street, when George fainted.

<p/>So George Talboys fell into a heavy slumber, and dreamed that he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) went to Ventnor, to find his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) wife alive and happy, but wrinkled, old, and gray, and to find his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) son grown into a young man.

<p/>Early the next morning he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) was seated opposite to Robert Audley in the first-class carriage of an express, whirling through the pretty open country toward Portsmouth.

<p/>They landed at Ventnor under the burning heat of the midday sun. As the two young men came from the steamer, the people on the pier stared at George's white face and untrimmed beard.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What are we to do, George?''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>Robert Audley asked. <div class="bookquote">``We have no clew to finding the people you want to see.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div><p/>The young man looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) with a pitiful, bewildered expression. The big dragoon was as helpless as a baby; and Robert Audley, the most vacillating and unenergetic of men, found himself called upon to act for another. He (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) rose superior to himself, and equal to the occasion.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Had we not better ask at one of the hotels about a Mrs. Talboys, George?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Her (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) father's name was Maldon,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/George Talboys/Mr. Talboys</b></font>)</div>George muttered; <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) could never have sent her (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) here to die alone.''

 (<font color='red'><b>George/George Talboys/Mr. Talboys</b></font>)</div><p/>They said nothing more; but Robert walked straight to a hotel where he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) inquired for a Mr. Maldon.

<p/>Yes, they told him (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>), there was a gentleman of that name stopping at Ventnor, a Captain Maldon; his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) daughter was lately dead. The waiter would go and inquire for the address.

<p/>The hotel was a busy place at this season; people hurrying in and out, and a great bustle of grooms and waiters about the halls.

<p/>George Talboys leaned against the doorpost, with much the same look in his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) face, as that which had frightened his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) friend in the Westminister coffee-house.

<p/>The worst was confirmed now. His (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) wife, Captain Maldon's daughter was dead.

<p/>The waiter returned in about five minutes to say that Captain Maldon was lodging at Lansdowne Cottage, No. 4.

<p/>They easily found the house, a shabby, low-windowed cottage, looking toward the water.

<p/>Was Captain Maldon at home? No, the landlady said; he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) had gone out on the beach with his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) little grandson. Would the gentleman walk in and sit down a bit?

<p/>George mechanically followed his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) friend into the little front parlor--dusty, shabbily furnished, and disorderly, with a child's broken toys scattered on the floor, and the scent of stale tobacco hanging about the muslin window-curtains.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Look!''  (<font color='red'><b>George/George Talboys/Mr. Talboys</b></font>)</div>said George, pointing to a picture over the mantelpiece.

<p/>It was his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) own portrait, painted in the old dragooning days. A pretty good likeness, representing him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) in uniform, with his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) charger in the background.

<p/>Perhaps the most animated of men would have been scarcely so wise a comforter as Robert Audley. He (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) did not utter a word to the stricken widower, but quietly seated himself with his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) back to George, looking out of the open window.

<p/>For some time the young man wandered restlessly about the room, looking at and sometimes touching the nick-nacks lying here and there.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) workbox, with an unfinished piece of work; her (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) album full of extracts from Byron and Moore, written in his (<font color='blue'><b>Moore</b></font>) own scrawling hand; some books which he (<font color='blue'><b>Moore</b></font>) had given her (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>), and a bunch of withered flowers in a vase they had bought in Italy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Her (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) portrait used to hang by the side of mine,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Moore</b></font>) muttered; <div class="bookquote">``I wonder what they have done with it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>By-and-by he (<font color='blue'><b>Moore</b></font>) said, after about an hour's silence:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I should like to see the woman of the house; I should like to ask her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) about--''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Moore</b></font>) broke down, and buried his (<font color='blue'><b>Moore</b></font>) face in his (<font color='blue'><b>Moore</b></font>) hands.

<p/>Robert summoned the landlady. She (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) was a good-natured garrulous creature, accustomed to sickness and death, for many of her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) lodgers came to her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) to die.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) told all the particulars of Mrs. Talboys' last hours; how she (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) had come to Ventnor only ten days before her (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) death, in the last stage of decline; and how, day by day, she (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) had gradually, but surely, sunk under the fatal malady. Was the gentleman any relative? she (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) asked of Robert Audley, as George sobbed aloud.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) is the lady's husband.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What!''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>the woman cried; <div class="bookquote">``him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) as deserted her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) so cruel, and left her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) pretty boy upon her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) poor old father's hands, which Captain Maldon has told me often, with the tears in his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) poor eyes?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I did not desert her (<font color='blue'><b>Maldon</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>George/George Talboys/Mr. Talboys</b></font>)</div>George cried out; and then he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) told the history of his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) three years' struggle.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Did she (<font color='blue'><b>Maldon</b></font>) speak of me?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) asked; <div class="bookquote">``did she (<font color='blue'><b>Maldon</b></font>) speak of me--at--at the last?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maldon</b></font>) went off as quiet as a lamb. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maldon</b></font>) said very little from the first; but the last day she (<font color='blue'><b>Maldon</b></font>) knew nobody, not even her (<font color='blue'><b>Maldon</b></font>) little boy, nor her (<font color='blue'><b>Maldon</b></font>) poor old father, who took on awful. Once she (<font color='blue'><b>Maldon</b></font>) went off wild-like, talking about her (<font color='blue'><b>Maldon</b></font>) mother, and about the cruel shame it was to leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Maldon</b></font>) to die in a strange place, till it was quite pitiful to hear her (<font color='blue'><b>Maldon</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Her (<font color='blue'><b>Maldon</b></font>) mother died when she (<font color='blue'><b>Maldon</b></font>) was quite a child,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/George Talboys/Mr. Talboys</b></font>)</div>said George. <div class="bookquote">``To think that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maldon</b></font>) should remember her (<font color='blue'><b>Maldon</b></font>) and speak of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maldon</b></font>), but never once of me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The woman</b></font>)</div><p/>The woman took him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) into the little bedroom in which his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) wife had died. He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) knelt down by the bed and kissed the pillow tenderly, the landlady crying as he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) did so.

<p/>While he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) was kneeling, praying, perhaps, with his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) face buried in this humble, snow-white pillow, the woman took something from a drawer. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) gave it to him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) rose from his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) knees; it was a long tress of hair wrapped in silver paper.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I cut this off when she (<font color='blue'><b>Maldon</b></font>) lay in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maldon</b></font>) coffin,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``poor dear?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) pressed the soft lock to his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) lips. <div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) murmured; <div class="bookquote">``this is the dear hair that I have kissed so often when her (<font color='blue'><b>Maldon</b></font>) head lay upon my shoulder. But it always had a rippling wave in it then, and now it seems smooth and straight.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It changes in illness,''  (<font color='red'><b>the landlady</b></font>)</div>said the landlady. <div class="bookquote">``If you'd like to see where they have laid her (<font color='blue'><b>Maldon</b></font>), Mr. Talboys, my little boy shall show you the way to the churchyard.''

 (<font color='red'><b>George/George Talboys/Mr. Talboys</b></font>)</div><p/>So George Talboys and his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) faithful friend walked to the quiet spot, where, beneath a mound of earth, to which the patches of fresh turf hardly adhered, lay that wife of whose welcoming smile George had dreamed so often in the far antipodes.

<p/>Robert left the young man by the side of this newly-made grave, and returning in about a quarter of an hour, found that he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) had not once stirred.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) looked up presently, and said that if there was a stone-mason's anywhere near he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) should like to give an order.

<p/>They very easily found the stonemason, and sitting down amidst the fragmentary litter of the man's yard, George Talboys wrote in pencil this brief inscription for the headstone of his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) dead wife's grave:


<p/>Sacred to the Memory of
HELEN,
THE BELOVED WIFE OF GEORGE TALBOYS,
``Who departed this life
August 24th, 18--, aged 22,
Deeply regretted by her (<font color='blue'><b>Maldon</b></font>) sorrowing Husband.

<p/>CHAPTER VI.

<p/>ANYWHERE, ANYWHERE OUT OF THE WORLD.

<p/>When they returned to Lansdowne Cottage they found the old man had not yet come in, so they walked down to the beach to look for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). After a brief search they found him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), sitting upon a heap of pebbles, reading a newspaper and eating filberts. The little boy was at some distance from his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) grandfather, digging in the sand with a wooden spade. The crape round the old man's shabby hat, and the child's poor little black frock, went to George's heart. Go where he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) would he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) met fresh confirmation of this great grief of his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) life. His (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) wife was dead.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Maldon,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) said, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) approached his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) father-in-law.

<p/>The old man looked up, and, dropping his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) newspaper, rose from the pebbles with a ceremonious bow. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) faded light hair was tinged with gray; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had a pinched hook nose; watery blue eyes, and an irresolute-looking mouth; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wore his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shabby dress with an affectation of foppish gentility; an eye-glass dangled over his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) closely buttoned-up waistcoat, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) carried a cane in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ungloved hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Great Heaven!''  (<font color='red'><b>George/George Talboys/Mr. Talboys</b></font>)</div>cried George, <div class="bookquote">``don't you know me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>George/George Talboys/Mr. Talboys</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Maldon started and colored violently, with something of a frightened look, as he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) recognized his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) son-in-law.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear boy,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I did not; for the first moment I did not. That beard makes such a difference. You find the beard makes a great difference, do you not, sir?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) said, appealing to Robert.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Great heavens!''  (<font color='red'><b>George/George Talboys/Mr. Talboys</b></font>)</div>exclaimed George Talboys, <div class="bookquote">``is this the way you welcome me? I come to England to find my wife dead within a week of my touching land, and you begin to chatter to me about my beard--you, her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) father!''

 (<font color='red'><b>George/George Talboys/Mr. Talboys</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``True! true!''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>muttered the old man, wiping his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) bloodshot eyes; <div class="bookquote">``a sad shock, a sad shock, my dear George. If you'd only been here a week earlier.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If I had,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/George Talboys/Mr. Talboys</b></font>)</div>cried George, in an outburst of grief and passion, <div class="bookquote">``I scarcely think that I would have let her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) die. I would have disputed for her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) with death. I would! I would! Oh God! why did not the Argus go down with every soul on board her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) before I came to see this day?''

 (<font color='red'><b>George/George Talboys/Mr. Talboys</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) began to walk up and down the beach, his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) father-in-law looking helplessly at him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>), rubbing his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) feeble eyes with a handkerchief.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've a strong notion that that old man didn't treat his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) daughter too well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>thought Robert, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) watched the half-pay lieutenant. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) seems, for some reason or other, to be half afraid of George.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/>While the agitated young man walked up and down in a fever of regret and despair, the child ran to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) grandfather, and clung about the tails of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) coat.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come home, grandpa, come home,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I'm tired.''

 (<font color='red'><b>George/George Talboys/Mr. Talboys</b></font>)</div><p/>George Talboys turned at the sound of the babyish voice, and looked long and earnestly at the boy.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) father's brown eyes and dark hair.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My darling! my darling!''  (<font color='red'><b>George/George Talboys/Mr. Talboys</b></font>)</div>said George, taking the child in his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) arms, <div class="bookquote">``I am your father, come across the sea to find you. Will you love me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the child</b></font>)</div><p/>The little fellow pushed him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) away. <div class="bookquote">``I don't know you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I love grandpa and Mrs. Monks at Southampton.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Georgey has a temper of his (<font color='blue'><b>Georgey</b></font>) own, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the old man. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Georgey</b></font>) has been spoiled.''

 (<font color='red'><b>George/George Talboys/Mr. Talboys</b></font>)</div><p/>They walked slowly back to the cottage, and once more George Talboys told the history of that desertion which had seemed so cruel. He (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) told, too, of the twenty thousand pounds banked by him (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) the day before. He (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) had not the heart to ask any questions about the past, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) father-in-law only told him (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) that a few months after his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) departure they had gone from the place where George left them to live at Southampton, where Helen got a few pupils for the piano, and where they managed pretty well till her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) health failed, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) fell into the decline of which she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) died. Like most sad stories it was a very brief one.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The boy seems fond of you, Mr. Maldon,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/George Talboys/Mr. Talboys</b></font>)</div>said George, after a pause.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>answered the old man, smoothing the child's curling hair; <div class="bookquote">``yes. Georgey is very fond of his (<font color='blue'><b>Georgey</b></font>) grandfather.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the child</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Georgey</b></font>) had better stop with you. The interest of my money will be about six hundred a year. You can draw a hundred of that for Georgey's education, leaving the rest to accumulate till he (<font color='blue'><b>Georgey</b></font>) is of age. My friend here will be trustee, and if he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) will undertake the charge, I will appoint him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) guardian to the boy, allowing him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) for the present to remain under your care.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But why not take care of him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) yourself, George?''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>asked Robert Audley.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Because I shall sail in the very next vessel that leaves Liverpool for Australia. I shall be better in the diggings or the backwoods than ever I could be here. I'm broken for a civilized life from this hour, Bob.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div><p/>The old man's weak eyes sparkled as George declared this determination.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My poor boy, I think you're right,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I really think you're right. The change, the wild life, the--the--''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) hesitated and broke down as Robert looked earnestly at him (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You're in a great hurry to get rid of your son-in-law, I think, Mr. Maldon,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) said, gravely.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Get rid of him (<font color='blue'><b>Maldon</b></font>), dear boy! Oh, no, no! But for his (<font color='blue'><b>Maldon</b></font>) own sake, my dear sir, for his (<font color='blue'><b>Maldon</b></font>) own sake, you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think for his (<font color='blue'><b>Maldon</b></font>) own sake he (<font color='blue'><b>Maldon</b></font>)'d much better stay in England and look after his (<font color='blue'><b>Maldon</b></font>) son,''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>said Robert.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But I tell you I can't,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/George Talboys/Mr. Talboys</b></font>)</div>cried George; <div class="bookquote">``every inch of this accursed ground is hateful to me--I want to run out of it as I would out of a graveyard. I'll go back to town to-night, get that business about the money settled early to-morrow morning, and start for Liverpool without a moment's delay. I shall be better when I've put half the world between me and her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) grave.''

 (<font color='red'><b>George/George Talboys/Mr. Talboys</b></font>)</div><p/>``Before he (<font color='blue'><b>Maldon</b></font>) left the house he (<font color='blue'><b>Maldon</b></font>) stole out to the landlady, and asked some more questions about his (<font color='blue'><b>Maldon</b></font>) dead wife.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Were they poor?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) asked, <div class="bookquote">``were they pinched for money while she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was ill?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, no!''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>the woman answered; <div class="bookquote">``though the captain dresses shabby, he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) has always plenty of sovereigns in his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) purse. The poor lady wanted for nothing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div><p/>George was relieved at this, though it puzzled him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) to know where the drunken half-pay lieutenant could have contrived to find money for all the expenses of his (<font color='blue'><b>lieutenant</b></font>) daughter's illness.

<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>lieutenant</b></font>) was too thoroughly broken down by the calamity which had befallen him (<font color='blue'><b>lieutenant</b></font>) to be able to think much of anything, so he (<font color='blue'><b>lieutenant</b></font>) asked no further questions, but walked with his (<font color='blue'><b>lieutenant</b></font>) father-in-law and Robert Audley down to the boat by which they were to cross to Portsmouth.

<p/>The old man bade Robert a very ceremonious adieu.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You did not introduce me to your friend, by-the-bye, my dear boy,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) said. George stared at him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>), muttered something indistinct, and ran down the ladder to the boat before Mr. Maldon could repeat his (<font color='blue'><b>Maldon</b></font>) request. The steamer sped away through the sunset, and the outline of the island melted in the horizon as they neared the opposite shore.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``To think,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/George Talboys/Mr. Talboys</b></font>)</div>said George, <div class="bookquote">``that two nights ago, at this time, I was steaming into Liverpool, full of the hope of clasping her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) to my heart, and to-night I am going away from her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) grave!''

 (<font color='red'><b>George/George Talboys/Mr. Talboys</b></font>)</div><p/>The document which appointed Robert Audley as guardian to little George Talboys was drawn up in a solicitor's office the next morning.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's a great responsibility,''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Robert; <div class="bookquote">``I, guardian to anybody or anything! I, who never in my life could take care of myself!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I trust in your noble heart, Bob,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/George Talboys/Mr. Talboys</b></font>)</div>said George. <div class="bookquote">``I know you will take care of my poor orphan boy, and see that he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) is well used by his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) grandfather. I shall only draw enough from Georgey's fortune to take me back to Sydney, and then begin my old work again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>George/George Talboys/Mr. Talboys</b></font>)</div><p/>But it seemed as if George was destined to be himself the guardian of his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) son; for when he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) reached Liverpool, he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) found that a vessel had just sailed, and that there would not be another for a month; so he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) returned to London, and once more threw himself upon Robert Audley's hospitality.

<p/>The barrister received him (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) with open arms; he (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) gave him (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) the room with the birds and flowers, and had a bed put up in his (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) dressing-room for himself. Grief is so selfish that George did not know the sacrifices his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) friend made for his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) comfort. He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) only knew that for him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) the sun was darkened, and the business of life done. He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) sat all day long smoking cigars, and staring at the flowers and canaries, chafing for the time to pass that he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) might be far out at sea.

<p/>But just as the hour was drawing near for the sailing of the vessel, Robert Audley came in one day, full of a great scheme.

<p/>A friend of his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>), another of those barristers whose last thought is of a brief, was going to St. Petersburg to spend the winter, and wanted Robert to accompany him (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>). Robert would only go on condition that George went too.

<p/>For a long time the young man resisted; but when he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) found that Robert was, in a quiet way, thoroughly determined upon not going without him (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) gave in, and consented to join the party. What did it matter? he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) said. One place was the same to him (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) as another; anywhere out of England; what did he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) care where?

<p/>This was not a very cheerful way of looking at things, but Robert Audley was quite satisfied with having won his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) consent.

<p/>The three young men started under very favorable circumstances, carrying letters of introduction to the most influential inhabitants of the Russian capital.

<p/>Before leaving England, Robert wrote to his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) cousin Alicia, telling her (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) of his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) intended departure with his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) old friend George Talboys, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) had lately met for the first time after a lapse of years, and who had just lost his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) wife.

<p/>Alicia's reply came by return post, and ran thus:

<p/>``MY DEAR ROBERT--How cruel of you to run away to that horrid St. Petersburg before the hunting season! I have heard that people lose their noses in that disagreeable climate, and as yours is rather a long one, I should advise you to return before the very severe weather sets in. What sort of person is this Mr. Talboys? If he (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) is very agreeable you may bring him (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) to the Court as soon as you return from your travels. Lady Audley tells me to request you to secure her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) a set of sables. You are not to consider the price, but to be sure that they are the handsomest that can be obtained. Papa is perfectly absurd about his (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>) new wife, and she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) and I cannot get on together at all; not that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) is disagreeable to me, for, as far as that goes, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) makes herself agreeable to every one; but she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) is so irretrievably childish and silly.

<p/>``Believe me to be, my dear Robert.

<p/>``Your affectionate cousin,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``ALICIA AUDLEY.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER VII.

<p/>AFTER A YEAR.

<p/>The first year of George Talboys' widowhood passed away, the deep band of crepe about his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) hat grew brown and dusty, and as the last burning day of another August faded out, he (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) sat smoking cigars in the quiet chambers of Figtree Court, much as he (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) had done the year before, when the horror of his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) grief was new to him (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>), and every object in life, however trifling or however important, seemed saturated with his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) one great sorrow.

<p/>But the big ex-dragoon had survived his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) affliction by a twelvemonth, and hard as it may be to have to tell it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) did not look much the worse for it. Heaven knows what wasted agonies of remorse and self-reproach may not have racked George's honest heart, as he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) lay awake at nights thinking of the wife he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) had abandoned in the pursuit of a fortune, which she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) never lived to share.

<p/>Once, while they were abroad, Robert Audley ventured to congratulate him (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) recovered spirits. He (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) burst into a bitter laugh.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you know, Bob,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``that when some of our fellows were wounded in India, they came home, bringing bullets inside them. They did not talk of them, and they were stout and hearty, and looked as well, perhaps, as you or I; but every change in the weather, however slight, every variation of the atmosphere, however trifling, brought back the old agony of their wounds as sharp as ever they had felt it on the battle-field. I've had my wound, Bob; I carry the bullet still, and I shall carry it into my coffin.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The travelers returned from St. Petersburg in the spring, and George again took up his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) quarters at his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) old friend's chambers, only leaving them now and then to run down to Southampton and take a look at his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) little boy. He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) always went loaded with toys and sweetmeats to give to the child; but, for all this, Georgey would not become very familiar with his (<font color='blue'><b>Georgey</b></font>) papa, and the young man's heart sickened as he (<font color='blue'><b>Georgey</b></font>) began to fancy that even his (<font color='blue'><b>Georgey</b></font>) child was lost to him (<font color='blue'><b>Georgey</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What can I do?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Georgey</b></font>) thought. <div class="bookquote">``If I take him (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) away from his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) grandfather, I shall break his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) heart; if I let him (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) remain, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) will grow up a stranger to me, and care more for that drunken old hypocrite than for his (<font color='blue'><b>hypocrite</b></font>) own father. But then, what could an ignorant, heavy dragoon like me do with such a child? What could I teach him (<font color='blue'><b>hypocrite</b></font>), except to smoke cigars and idle around all day with his (<font color='blue'><b>hypocrite</b></font>) hands in his (<font color='blue'><b>hypocrite</b></font>) pockets?''

 (<font color='red'><b>George/George Talboys/Mr. Talboys</b></font>)</div><p/>So the anniversary of that 30th of August, upon which George had seen the advertisement of his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) wife's death in the Times newspaper, came round for the first time, and the young man put off his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) black clothes and the shabby crape from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hat, and laid his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mournful garments in a trunk in which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) kept a packet of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife's letters, her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) portrait, and that lock of hair which had been cut from her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) head after death. Robert Audley had never seen either the letters, the portrait, or the long tress of silky hair; nor, indeed, had George ever mentioned the name of his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) dead wife after that one day at Ventnor, on which he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) learned the full particulars of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) decease.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall write to my cousin Alicia to-day, George,''  (<font color='red'><b>the barrister</b></font>)</div>the young barrister said, upon this very 30th of August. <div class="bookquote">``Do you know that the day after to-morrow is the 1st of September? I shall write and tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) that we will both run down to the Court for a week's shooting.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no, Bob; go by yourself; they don't want me, and I'd rather--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Bury yourself in Figtree Court, with no company but my dogs and canaries! No, George, you shall do nothing of the kind.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I don't care for shooting.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And do you suppose I care for it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>cried Robert, with charming naivete. <div class="bookquote">``Why, man, I don't know a partridge from a pigeon, and it might be the 1st of April, instead of the 1st of September, for aught I care. I never hurt a bird in my life, but I have hurt my own shoulder with the weight of my gun. I only go down to Essex for the change of air, the good dinners, and the sight of my uncle's honest, handsome face. Besides, this time I've another inducement, as I want to see this fair-haired paragon--my new aunt. You'll go with me, George?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, if you really wish it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>The quiet form his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) grief had taken after its first brief violence, left him (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) as submissive as a child to the will of his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) friend; ready to go anywhere or do anything; never enjoying himself, or originating any enjoyment, but joining in the pleasures of others with a hopeless, uncomplaining, unobtrusive resignation peculiar to his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) simple nature. But the return of post brought a letter from Alicia Audley, to say that the two young men could not be received at the Court.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There are seventeen spare bed-rooms,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>wrote the young lady, in an indignant running hand, <div class="bookquote">``but for all that, my dear Robert, you can't come; for my lady has taken it into her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) silly head that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) is too ill to entertain visitors -LRB-there is no more the matter with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) than there is with me-RRB-, and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) cannot have gentlemen -LRB-great, rough men, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) says-RRB- in the house. Please apologize to your friend Mr. Talboys, and tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) that papa expects to see you both in the hunting season.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My lady's airs and graces shan't keep us out of Essex for all that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>said Robert, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) twisted the letter into a pipe-light for his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) big meerschaum. <div class="bookquote">``I'll tell you what we'll do, George: there's a glorious inn at Audley, and plenty of fishing in the neighborhood; we'll go there and have a week's sport. Fishing is much better than shooting; you've only to lie on a bank and stare at your line; I don't find that you often catch anything, but it's very pleasant.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) held the twisted letter to the feeble spark of fire glimmering in the grate, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) spoke, and then changing his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) mind, deliberately unfolded it, and smoothed the crumpled paper with his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Poor little Alicia!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) said, thoughtfully; <div class="bookquote">``it's rather hard to treat her (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) letter so cavalierly--I'll keep it;''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>upon which Mr. Robert Audley put the note back into its envelope, and afterward thrust it into a pigeon-hole in his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) office desk, marked important. Heaven knows what wonderful documents there were in this particular pigeon-hole, but I do not think it likely to have contained anything of great judicial value. If any one could at that moment have told the young barrister that so simple a thing as his (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) cousin's brief letter would one day come to be a link in that terrible chain of evidence afterward to be slowly forged in the only criminal case in which he (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) was ever to be concerned, perhaps Mr. Robert Audley would have lifted his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) eyebrows a little higher than usual.

<p/>So the two young men left London the next day, with one portmanteau and a rod and tackle between them, and reached the straggling, old-fashioned, fast-decaying village of Audley, in time to order a good dinner at the Sun Inn.

<p/>Audley Court was about three-quarters of a mile from the village, lying, as I have said, deep down in the hollow, shut in by luxuriant timber. You could only reach it by a cross-road bordered by trees, and as trimly kept as the avenues in a gentleman's park. It was a lonely place enough, even in all its rustic beauty, for so bright a creature as the late Miss Lucy Graham, but the generous baronet had transformed the interior of the gray old mansion into a little palace for his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) young wife, and Lady Audley seemed as happy as a child surrounded by new and costly toys.

<p/>In her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) better fortunes, as in her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) old days of dependence, wherever she (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) went she (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) seemed to take sunshine and gladness with her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>). In spite of Miss Alicia's undisguised contempt for her (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) step-mother's childishness and frivolity, Lucy was better loved and more admired than the baronet's daughter. That very childishness had a charm which few could resist. The innocence and candor of an infant beamed in Lady Audley's fair face, and shone out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) large and liquid blue eyes. The rosy lips, the delicate nose, the profusion of fair ringlets, all contributed to preserve to her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) beauty the character of extreme youth and freshness. She (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) owned to twenty years of age, but it was hard to believe her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) more than seventeen. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) fragile figure, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) loved to dress in heavy velvets, and stiff, rustling silks, till she (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) looked like a child tricked out for a masquerade, was as girlish as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) had just left the nursery. All her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) amusements were childish. She (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) hated reading, or study of any kind, and loved society. Rather than be alone, she (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) would admit Phoebe Marks into her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) confidence, and loll on one of the sofas in her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) luxurious dressing-room, discussing a new costume for some coming dinner-party; or sit chattering to the girl with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) jewel-box beside her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), upon the satin cushions, and Sir Michael's presents spread out in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) lap, while she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) counted and admired her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) treasures.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had appeared at several public balls at Chelmsford and Colchester, and was immediately established as the belle of the county. Pleased with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) high position and her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) handsome house; with every caprice gratified, every whim indulged; admired and caressed wherever she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) went; fond of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) generous husband; rich in a noble allowance of pin-money; with no poor relations to worry her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) with claims upon her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) purse or patronage; it would have been hard to find in the County of Essex a more fortunate creature than Lucy, Lady Audley.

<p/>The two young men loitered over the dinner-table in the private sitting-room at the Sun Inn. The windows were thrown wide open, and the fresh country air blew in upon them as they dined. The weather was lovely; the foliage of the woods touched here and there with faint gleams of the earliest tints of autumn; the yellow corn still standing in some of the fields, in others just falling under the shining sickle; while in the narrow lanes you met great wagons drawn by broad-chested cart-horses, carrying home the rich golden store. To any one who has been, during the hot summer months, pent up in London, there is in the first taste of rustic life a kind of sensuous rapture scarcely to be described. George Talboys felt this, and in this he (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) experienced the nearest approach to enjoyment that he (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) had ever known since his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) wife's death.

<p/>The clock struck five as they finished dinner.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Put on your hat, George,''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>said Robert Audley; <div class="bookquote">``they don't dine at the Court till seven; we shall have time to stroll down and see the old place and its inhabitants.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div><p/>The landlord, who had come into the room with a bottle of wine, looked up as the young man spoke.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I beg your pardon, Mr. Audley,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``but if you want to see your uncle, you'll lose your time by going to the Court just now. Sir Michael and my lady and Miss Alicia have all gone to the races up at Chorley, and they won't be back till nigh upon eight o'clock, most likely. They must pass by here to go home.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Under these circumstances of course it was no use going to the Court, so the two young men strolled through the village and looked at the old church, and then went and reconnoitered the streams in which they were to fish the next day, and by such means beguiled the time until after seven o'clock. At about a quarter past that hour they returned to the inn, and seating themselves in the open window, lit their cigars and looked out at the peaceful prospect.

<p/>We hear every day of murders committed in the country. Brutal and treacherous murders; slow, protracted agonies from poisons administered by some kindred hand; sudden and violent deaths by cruel blows, inflicted with a stake cut from some spreading oak, whose every shadow promised--peace. In the county of which I write, I have been shown a meadow in which, on a quiet summer Sunday evening, a young farmer murdered the girl who had loved and trusted him (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>); and yet, even now, with the stain of that foul deed upon it, the aspect of the spot is--peace. No species of crime has ever been committed in the worst rookeries about Seven Dials that has not been also done in the face of that rustic calm which still, in spite of all, we look on with a tender, half-mournful yearning, and associate with--peace.

<p/>It was dusk when gigs and chaises, dog-carts and clumsy farmers' phaetons, began to rattle through the village street, and under the windows of the Sun Inn; deeper dusk still when an open carriage and four drew suddenly up beneath the rocking sign-post.

<p/>It was Sir Michael Audley's barouche which came to so sudden a stop before the little inn. The harness of one of the leaders had become out of order, and the foremost postillion dismounted to set it right.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, it's my uncle,''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>cried Robert Audley, as the carriage stopped. <div class="bookquote">``I'll run down and speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>George/George Talboys/Mr. Talboys</b></font>)</div><p/>George lit another cigar, and, sheltered by the window-curtains, looked out at the little party. Alicia sat with her (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) back to the horses, and he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) could perceive, even in the dusk, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) was a handsome brunette; but Lady Audley was seated on the side of the carriage furthest from the inn, and he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) could see nothing of the fair-haired paragon of whom he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) had heard so much.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, Robert,''  (<font color='red'><b>Michael/Michael Audley/Audley</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Sir Michael, as his (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) nephew emerged from the inn, <div class="bookquote">``this is a surprise!''

 (<font color='red'><b>nephew</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have not come to intrude upon you at the Court, my dear uncle,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the young man, as the baronet shook him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) by the hand in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own hearty fashion. <div class="bookquote">``Essex is my native county, you know, and about this time of year I generally have a touch of homesickness; so George and I have come down to the inn for two or three day's fishing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``George--George who?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``George Talboys.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What, has he (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) come?''  (<font color='red'><b>Alicia/Miss Audley/Miss Alicia</b></font>)</div>cried Alicia. <div class="bookquote">``I'm so glad; for I'm dying to see this handsome young widower.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you, Alicia?''  (<font color='red'><b>cousin</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) cousin, <div class="bookquote">``Then egad, I'll run and fetch him (<font color='blue'><b>widower</b></font>), and introduce you to him (<font color='blue'><b>widower</b></font>) at once.''

 (<font color='red'><b>cousin</b></font>)</div><p/>Now, so complete was the dominion which Lady Audley had, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) own childish, unthinking way, obtained over her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) devoted husband, that it was very rarely that the baronet's eyes were long removed from his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) wife's pretty face. When Robert, therefore, was about to re-enter the inn, it needed but the faintest elevation of Lucy's eyebrows, with a charming expression of weariness and terror, to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) husband aware that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) did not want to be bored by an introduction to Mr. George Talboys.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Never mind to-night, Bob,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``My wife is a little tired after our long day's pleasure. Bring your friend to dinner to-morrow, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) and Alicia can make each other's acquaintance. Come round and speak to Lady Audley, and then we'll drive home.''

 (<font color='red'><b>lady</b></font>)</div><p/>My lady was so terribly fatigued that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) could only smile sweetly, and hold out a tiny gloved hand to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) nephew by marriage.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You will come and dine with us to-morrow, and bring your interesting friend?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said, in a low and tired voice. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had been the chief attraction of the race-course, and was wearied out by the exertion of fascinating half the county.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's a wonder she (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) didn't treat you to her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) never-ending laugh,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alicia/Miss Audley/Miss Alicia</b></font>)</div>whispered Alicia, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) leaned over the carriage-door to bid Robert good-night; <div class="bookquote">``but I dare say she (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) reserves that for your delectation to-morrow. I suppose you are fascinated as well as everybody else?''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>added the young lady, rather snappishly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) is a lovely creature, certainly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>murmured Robert, with placid admiration.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, of course! Now, she (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) is the first woman of whom I ever heard you say a civil word, Robert Audley. I'm sorry to find you can only admire wax dolls.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Alicia/Miss Audley/Miss Alicia</b></font>)</div><p/>Poor Alicia had had many skirmishes with her (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) cousin upon that particular temperament of his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>), which, while it enabled him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) to go through life with perfect content and tacit enjoyment, entirely precluded his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) feeling one spark of enthusiasm upon any subject whatever.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``As to his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) ever falling in love,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>thought the young lady sometimes, <div class="bookquote">``the idea is preposterous. If all the divinities on earth were ranged before him (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>), waiting for his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) sultanship to throw the handkerchief, he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) would only lift his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) eyebrows to the middle of his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) forehead, and tell them to scramble for it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div><p/>But, for once in his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) life, Robert was almost enthusiastic.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>)'s the prettiest little creature you ever saw in your life, George,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) cried, when the carriage had driven off and he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) returned to his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) friend. <div class="bookquote">``Such blue eyes, such ringlets, such a ravishing smile, such a fairy-like bonnet--all of a-tremble with heart's-ease and dewy spangles, shining out of a cloud of gauze. George Talboys, I feel like the hero of a French novel: I am falling in love with my aunt.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The widower</b></font>)</div><p/>The widower only sighed and puffed his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) cigar fiercely out of the open window. Perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) was thinking of that far-away time--little better than five years ago, in fact; but such an age gone by to him (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>)--when he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) first met the woman for whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) had worn crape round his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) hat three days before. They returned, all those old unforgotten feelings; they came back, with the scene of their birth-place. Again he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) lounged with his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) brother officers upon the shabby pier at the shabby watering-place, listening to a dreary band with a cornet that was a note and a half flat. Again he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) heard the old operatic airs, and again she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) came tripping toward him (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>), leaning on her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) old father's arm, and pretending -LRB-with such a charming, delicious, serio-comic pretense-RRB- to be listening to the music, and quite unaware of the admiration of half a dozen open-mouthed cavalry officers. Again the old fancy came back that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was something too beautiful for earth, or earthly uses, and that to approach her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was to walk in a higher atmosphere and to breathe a purer air. And since this she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had been his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) wife, and the mother of his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) child. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) lay in the little churchyard at Ventnor, and only a year ago he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) had given the order for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) tombstone. A few slow, silent tears dropped upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) waistcoat as he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) thought of these things in the quiet and darkening room.

<p/>Lady Audley was so exhausted when she (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) reached home, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) excused herself from the dinner-table, and retired at once to her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) dressing-room, attended by her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) maid, Phoebe Marks.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) was a little capricious in her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) conduct to this maid--sometimes very confidential, sometimes rather reserved; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) was a liberal mistress, and the girl had every reason to be satisfied with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) situation.

<p/>This evening, in spite of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) fatigue, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was in extremely high spirits, and gave an animated account of the races, and the company present at them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am tired to death, though, Phoebe,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) said, by-and-by. <div class="bookquote">``I am afraid I must look a perfect fright, after a day in the hot sun.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Audley/LADY AUDLEY</b></font>)</div><p/>There were lighted candles on each side of the glass before which Lady Audley was standing unfastening her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) dress. She (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) looked full at her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) maid as she (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) spoke, her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) blue eyes clear and bright, and the rosy childish lips puckered into an arch smile.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are a little pale, my lady,''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>answered the girl, <div class="bookquote">``but you look as pretty as ever.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's right, Phoebe,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) said, flinging herself into a chair, and throwing back her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) curls at the maid, who stood, brush in hand, ready to arrange the luxuriant hair for the night. <div class="bookquote">``Do you know, Phoebe, I have heard some people say that you and I are alike?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have heard them say so, too, my lady,''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>said the girl, quietly <div class="bookquote">``but they must be very stupid to say it, for your ladyship is a beauty, and I am a poor, plain creature.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not at all, Phoebe,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>said the little lady, superbly; <div class="bookquote">``you are like me, and your features are very nice; it is only color that you want. My hair is pale yellow shot with gold, and yours is drab; my eyebrows and eyelashes are dark brown, and yours are almost--I scarcely like to say it, but they're almost white, my dear Phoebe. Your complexion is sallow, and mine is pink and rosy. Why, with a bottle of hair-dye, such as we see advertised in the papers, and a pot of rouge, you'd be as good-looking as I, any day, Phoebe.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) prattled on in this way for a long time, talking of a hundred different subjects, and ridiculing the people she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had met at the races, for her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) maid's amusement. Her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) step-daughter came into the dressing-room to bid her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) good-night, and found the maid and mistress laughing aloud over one of the day's adventures. Alicia, who was never familiar with her (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) servants, withdrew in disgust at my lady's frivolity.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Go on brushing my hair, Phoebe,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Audley/LADY AUDLEY</b></font>)</div>Lady Audley said, every time the girl was about to complete her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) task, <div class="bookquote">``I quite enjoy a chat with you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div><p/>At last, just as she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had dismissed her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) maid, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) suddenly called her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) back. <div class="bookquote">``Phoebe Marks,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I want you to do me a favor.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, my lady.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I want you to go to London by the first train to-morrow morning to execute a little commission for me. You may take a day's holiday afterward, as I know you have friends in town; and I shall give you a five-pound note if you do what I want, and keep your own counsel about it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, my lady.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``See that that door is securely shut, and come and sit on this stool at my feet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The girl</b></font>)</div><p/>The girl obeyed. Lady Audley smoothed her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) maid's neutral-tinted hair with her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) plump, white, and bejeweled hand as she (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) reflected for a few moments.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And now listen, Phoebe. What I want you to do is very simple.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Audley/LADY AUDLEY</b></font>)</div><p/>It was so simple that it was told in five minutes, and then Lady Audley retired into her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) bed-room, and curled herself up cozily under the eider-down quilt. She (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) was a chilly creature, and loved to bury herself in soft wrappings of satin and fur.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Kiss me, Phoebe,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) said, as the girl arranged the curtains. <div class="bookquote">``I hear Sir Michael's step in the anteroom; you will meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) as you go out, and you may as well tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) that you are going up by the first train to-morrow morning to get my dress from Madam Frederick for the dinner at Morton Abbey.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Audley/LADY AUDLEY</b></font>)</div><p/>It was late the next morning when Lady Audley went down to breakfast--past ten o'clock. While she (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) was sipping her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) coffee a servant brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) a sealed packet, and a book for her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) to sign.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A telegraphic message!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) cried; for the convenient word telegram had not yet been invented. <div class="bookquote">``What can be the matter?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) looked up at her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) husband with wide-open, terrified eyes, and seemed half afraid to break the seal. The envelope was addressed to Miss Lucy Graham, at Mr. Dawson's, and had been sent on from the village.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Read it, my darling,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Dawson</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``and do not be alarmed; it may be nothing of any importance.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>It came from a Mrs. Vincent, the schoolmistress with whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) had lived before entering Mr. Dawson's family. The lady was dangerously ill, and implored her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) old pupil to go and see her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Poor soul! she (<font color='blue'><b>Frederick</b></font>) always meant to leave me her (<font color='blue'><b>Frederick</b></font>) money,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Graham/Lucy Graham</b></font>)</div>said Lucy, with a mournful smile. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Frederick</b></font>) has never heard of the change in my fortunes. Dear Sir Michael, I must go to her (<font color='blue'><b>Frederick</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To be sure you must, dearest. If she (<font color='blue'><b>Frederick</b></font>) was kind to my poor girl in her (<font color='blue'><b>Frederick</b></font>) adversity, she (<font color='blue'><b>Frederick</b></font>) has a claim upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Frederick</b></font>) prosperity that shall never be forgotten. Put on your bonnet, Lucy; we shall be in time to catch the express.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You will go with me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course, my darling. Do you suppose I would let you go alone?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I was sure you would go with me,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) said, thoughtfully.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Does your friend send any address?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) always lived at Crescent Villa, West Brompton; and no doubt she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) lives there still.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Audley/LADY AUDLEY</b></font>)</div><p/>There was only time for Lady Audley to hurry on her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) bonnet and shawl before she (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) heard the carriage drive round to the door, and Sir Michael calling to her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) at the foot of the staircase.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) suite of rooms, as I have said, opened one out of another, and terminated in an octagon antechamber hung with oil-paintings. Even in her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) haste she (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) paused deliberately at the door of this room, double-locked it, and dropped the key into her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) pocket. This door once locked cut off all access to my lady's apartments.

<p/>CHAPTER VIII.

<p/>BEFORE THE STORM.

<p/>So the dinner at Audley Court was postponed, and Miss Alicia had to wait still longer for an introduction to the handsome young widower, Mr. George Talboys.

<p/>I am afraid, if the real truth is to be told, there was, perhaps, something of affectation in the anxiety this young lady expressed to make George's acquaintance; but if poor Alicia for a moment calculated upon arousing any latent spark of jealousy lurking in her (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) cousin's breast by this exhibition of interest, she (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) was not so well acquainted with Robert Audley's disposition as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) might have been. Indolent, handsome, and indifferent, the young barrister took life as altogether too absurd a mistake for any one event in its foolish course to be for a moment considered seriously by a sensible man.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pretty, gipsy-faced cousin might have been over head and ears in love with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>); and she (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) might have told him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) so, in some charming, roundabout, womanly fashion, a hundred times a day for all the three hundred and sixty-five days in the year; but unless she (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) had waited for some privileged 29th of February, and walked straight up to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), saying, <div class="bookquote">``Robert, please will you marry me?''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>I very much doubt if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would ever have discovered the state of her (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) feelings.

<p/>Again, had he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) been in love with her (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) himself, I fancy that the tender passion would, with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), have been so vague and feeble a sentiment that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) might have gone down to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) grave with a dim sense of some uneasy sensation which might be love or indigestion, and with, beyond this, no knowledge whatever of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) state.

<p/>So it was not the least use, my poor Alicia, to ride about the lanes around Audley during those three days which the two young men spent in Essex; it was wasted trouble to wear that pretty cavalier hat and plume, and to be always, by the most singular of chances, meeting Robert and his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) friend. The black curls -LRB-nothing like Lady Audley's feathery ringlets, but heavy clustering locks, that clung about your slender brown throat-RRB-, the red and pouting lips, the nose inclined to be retrousse, the dark complexion, with its bright crimson flush, always ready to glance up like a signal light in a dusky sky, when you came suddenly upon your apathetic cousin--all this coquettish espiegle, brunette beauty was thrown away upon the dull eyes of Robert Audley, and you might as well have taken your rest in the cool drawing-room at the Court, instead of working your pretty mare to death under the hot September sun.

<p/>Now fishing, except to the devoted disciple of Izaak Walton, is not the most lively of occupations; therefore, it is scarcely, perhaps, to be wondered that on the day after Lady Audley's departure, the two young men -LRB-one of whom was disabled by that heart wound which he (<font color='blue'><b>Walton</b></font>) bore so quietly, from really taking pleasure in anything, and the other of whom looked upon almost all pleasure as a negative kind of trouble-RRB- began to grow weary of the shade of the willows overhanging the winding streams about Audley.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Figtree Court is not gay in the long vacation,''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>said Robert, reflectively: <div class="bookquote">``but I think, upon the whole, it's better than this; at any rate, it's near a tobacconist's,''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) added, puffing resignedly at an execrable cigar procured from the landlord of the Sun Inn.

<p/>George Talboys, who had only consented to the Essex expedition in passive submission to his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) friend, was by no means inclined to object to their immediate return to London. <div class="bookquote">``I shall be glad to get back, Bob,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``for I want to take a run down to Southampton; I haven't seen the little one for upward of a month.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) always spoke of his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) son as <div class="bookquote">``the little one;''  (<font color='red'><b>son</b></font>)</div>always spoke of him (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) mournfully rather than hopefully. He (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) accounted for this by saying that he (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) had a fancy that the child would never learn to love him (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>); and worse even than this fancy, a dim presentiment that he (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) would not live to see his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) little Georgey reach manhood.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm not a romantic man, Bob,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) would say sometimes, <div class="bookquote">``and I never read a line of poetry in my life that was any more to me than so many words and so much jingle; but a feeling has come over me, since my wife's death, that I am like a man standing upon a long, low shore, with hideous cliffs frowning down upon him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) from behind, and the rising tide crawling slowly but surely about his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) feet. It seems to grow nearer and nearer every day, that black, pitiless tide; not rushing upon me with a great noise and a mighty impetus, but crawling, creeping, stealing, gliding toward me, ready to close in above my head when I am least prepared for the end.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Robert Audley stared at his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) friend in silent amazement; and, after a pause of profound deliberation, said solemnly, <div class="bookquote">``George Talboys, I could understand this if you had been eating heavy suppers. Cold pork, now, especially if underdone, might produce this sort of thing. You want change of air, my dear boy; you want the refreshing breezes of Figtree Court, and the soothing air of Fleet street. Or, stay,''  (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) added, suddenly, <div class="bookquote">``I have it! You've been smoking our friend the landlord's cigars; that accounts for everything.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>They met Alicia Audley on her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) mare about half an hour after they had come to the determination of leaving Essex early the next morning. The young lady was very much surprised and disappointed at hearing her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) cousin's determination, and for that very reason pretended to take the matter with supreme indifference.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are very soon tired of Audley, Robert,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said, carelessly; <div class="bookquote">``but of course you have no friends here, except your relations at the Court; while in London, no doubt, you have the most delightful society and--''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I get good tobacco,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>murmured Robert, interrupting his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) cousin. <div class="bookquote">``Audley is the dearest old place, but when a man has to smoke dried cabbage leaves, you know, Alicia--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then you are really going to-morrow morning?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Positively--by the express train that leaves at 10.50.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then Lady Audley will lose an introduction to Mr. Talboys, and Mr. Talboys will lose the chance of seeing the prettiest woman in Essex.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Really--''  (<font color='red'><b>George/George Talboys/Mr. Talboys</b></font>)</div>stammered George.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The prettiest woman in Essex would have a poor chance of getting much admiration out of my friend, George Talboys,''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>said Robert. <div class="bookquote">``His (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) heart is at Southampton, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) has a curly-headed little urchin, about as high as his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) knee, who calls him (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) `the big gentleman,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>and asks him (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) for sugar-plums.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am going to write to my step-mother by to-night's post,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alicia/Miss Audley/Miss Alicia</b></font>)</div>said Alicia. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) asked me particularly in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) letter how long you were going to stop, and whether there was any chance of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) being back in time to receive you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Alicia/Miss Audley/Miss Alicia</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Audley took a letter from the pocket of her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) riding-jacket as she (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) spoke--a pretty, fairy-like note, written on shining paper of a peculiar creamy hue.

<p/>``She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) says in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) postcript, <div class="bookquote">``Be sure you answer my question about Mr. Audley and his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) friend, you volatile, forgetful Alicia!'''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What a pretty hand she (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) writes!''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>said Robert, as his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) cousin folded the note.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, it is pretty, is it not? Look at it, Robert.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) put the letter into his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) hand, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) contemplated it lazily for a few minutes, while Alicia patted the graceful neck of her (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) chestnut mare, which was anxious to be off once more.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Presently, Atalanta, presently. Give me back my note, Bob.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is the prettiest, most coquettish little hand I ever saw. Do you know, Alicia, I have no great belief in those fellows who ask you for thirteen postage stamps, and offer to tell you what you have never been able to find out yourself; but upon my word I think that if I had never seen your aunt, I should know what she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) was like by this slip of paper. Yes, here it all is--the feathery, gold-shot, flaxen curls, the penciled eyebrows, the tiny, straight nose, the winning, childish smile; all to be guessed in these few graceful up-strokes and down-strokes. George, look here!''

 (<font color='red'><b>George/George Talboys/Mr. Talboys</b></font>)</div><p/>But absent-minded and gloomy George Talboys had strolled away along the margin of the ditch, and stood striking the bulrushes with his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) cane, half a dozen paces away from Robert and Alicia.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nevermind,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>said the young lady, impatiently; for she (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) by no means relished this long disquisition upon my lady's note. <div class="bookquote">``Give me the letter, and let me go; it's past eight, and I must answer it by to-night's post. Come, Atalanta! Good-by, Robert--good-by, Mr. Talboys. A pleasant journey to town.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The chestnut mare</b></font>)</div><p/>The chestnut mare cantered briskly through the lane, and Miss Audley was out of sight before those two big, bright tears that stood in her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) eyes for one moment, before her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) pride sent them, back again, rose from her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) angry heart.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``To have only one cousin in the world,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) cried, passionately, <div class="bookquote">``my nearest relation after papa, and for him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) to care about as much for me as he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) would for a dog!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>By the merest of accidents, however, Robert and his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) friend did not go by the 10.50 express on the following morning, for the young barrister awoke with such a splitting headache, that he (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) asked George to send him (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) a cup of the strongest green tea that had ever been made at the Sun, and to be furthermore so good as to defer their journey until the next day. Of course George assented, and Robert Audley spent the forenoon in a darkened room with a five-days'-old Chelmsford paper to entertain himself withal.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's nothing but the cigars, George,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) said, repeatedly. <div class="bookquote">``Get me out of the place without my seeing the landlord; for if that man and I meet there will be bloodshed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Fortunately for the peace of Audley, it happened to be market-day at Chelmsford; and the worthy landlord had ridden off in his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) chaise-cart to purchase supplies for his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) house--among other things, perhaps, a fresh stock of those very cigars which had been so fatal in their effect upon Robert.

<p/>The young men spent a dull, dawdling, stupid, unprofitable day; and toward dusk Mr. Audley proposed that they should stroll down to the Court, and ask Alicia to take them over the house.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It will kill a couple of hours, you know, George: and it seems a great pity to drag you away from Audley without having shown you the old place, which, I give you my honor, is very well worth seeing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The sun was low in the skies as they took a short cut through the meadows, and crossed a stile into the avenue leading to the archway--a lurid, heavy-looking, ominous sunset, and a deathly stillness in the air, which frightened the birds that had a mind to sing, and left the field open to a few captious frogs croaking in the ditches. Still as the atmosphere was, the leaves rustled with that sinister, shivering motion which proceeds from no outer cause, but is rather an instinctive shudder of the frail branches, prescient of a coming storm. That stupid clock, which knew no middle course, and always skipped from one hour to the other, pointed to seven as the young men passed under the archway; but, for all that, it was nearer eight.

<p/>They found Alicia in the lime-walk, wandering listlessly up and down under the black shadow of the trees, from which every now and then a withered leaf flapped slowly to the ground.

<p/>Strange to say, George Talboys, who very seldom observed anything, took particular notice of this place.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It ought to be an avenue in a churchyard,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``How peacefully the dead might sleep under this somber shade! I wish the churchyard at Ventnor was like this.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They walked on to the ruined well; and Alicia told them some old legend connected with the spot--some gloomy story, such as those always attached to an old house, as if the past were one dark page of sorrow and crime.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We want to see the house before it is dark, Alicia,''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>said Robert.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then we must be quick.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) answered. <div class="bookquote">``Come.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) led the way through an open French window, modernized a few years before, into the library, and thence to the hall.

<p/>In the hall they passed my lady's pale-faced maid, who looked furtively under her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) white eyelashes at the two young men.

<p/>They were going up-stairs, when Alicia turned and spoke to the girl.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``After we have been in the drawing-room, I should like to show these gentlemen Lady Audley's rooms. Are they in good order, Phoebe?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, miss; but the door of the anteroom is locked, and I fancy that my lady has taken the key to London.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Taken the key! Impossible!''  (<font color='red'><b>Alicia/Miss Audley/Miss Alicia</b></font>)</div>cried Alicia.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed, miss, I think she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) has. I cannot find it, and it always used to be in the door.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I declare,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alicia/Miss Audley/Miss Alicia</b></font>)</div>said Alicia, impatiently, <div class="bookquote">``that is not at all unlike my lady to have taken this silly freak into her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) head. I dare say she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was afraid we should go into her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) rooms, and pry about among her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) pretty dresses, and meddle with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) jewelry. It is very provoking, for the best pictures in the house are in that antechamber. There is her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) own portrait, too, unfinished but wonderfully like.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Alicia/Miss Audley/Miss Alicia</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) portrait!''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Robert Audley. <div class="bookquote">``I would give anything to see it, for I have only an imperfect notion of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) face. Is there no other way of getting into the room, Alicia?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Another way?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; is there any door, leading through some of the other rooms, by which we can contrive to get into hers?''

 (<font color='red'><b>cousin</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) cousin shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) head, and conducted them into a corridor where there were some family portraits. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) showed them a tapestried chamber, the large figures upon the faded canvas looking threatening in the dusky light.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That fellow with the battle-ax looks as if he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) wanted to split George's head open,''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Audley, pointing to a fierce warrior, whose uplifted arm appeared above George Talboys' dark hair.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come out of this room, Alicia,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>added the young man, nervously; <div class="bookquote">``I believe it's damp, or else haunted. Indeed, I believe all ghosts to be the result of damp or dyspepsia. You sleep in a damp bed--you awake suddenly in the dead of the night with a cold shiver, and see an old lady in the court costume of George the First's time, sitting at the foot of the bed. The old lady's indigestion, and the cold shiver is a damp sheet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/>There were lighted candles in the drawing-room. No new-fangled lamps had ever made their appearance at Audley Court. Sir Michael's rooms were lighted by honest, thick, yellow-looking wax candles, in massive silver candlesticks, and in sconces against the walls.

<p/>There was very little to see in the drawing-room; and George Talboys soon grew tired of staring at the handsome modern furniture, and at a few pictures of some of the Academicians.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Isn't there a secret passage, or an old oak chest, or something of that kind, somewhere about the place, Alicia?''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>asked Robert.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``To be sure!''  (<font color='red'><b>Alicia/Miss Audley/Miss Alicia</b></font>)</div>cried Miss Audley, with a vehemence that startled her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) cousin; <div class="bookquote">``of course. Why didn't I think of it before? How stupid of me, to be sure!''

 (<font color='red'><b>cousin</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why stupid?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because, if you don't mind crawling upon your hands and knees, you can see my lady's apartments, for that passage communicates with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) dressing-room. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) doesn't know of it herself, I believe. How astonished she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)'d be if some black-visored burglar, with a dark-lantern, were to rise through the floor some night as she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) sat before her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) looking-glass, having her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) hair dressed for a party!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Shall we try the secret passage, George?''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>asked Mr. Audley.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, if you wish it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Alicia/Miss Audley/Miss Alicia</b></font>)</div><p/>Alicia led them into the room which had once been her (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) nursery. It was now disused, except on very rare occasions when the house was full of company.

<p/>Robert Audley lifted a corner of the carpet, according to his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) cousin's directions, and disclosed a rudely-cut trap-door in the oak flooring.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now listen to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alicia/Miss Audley/Miss Alicia</b></font>)</div>said Alicia. <div class="bookquote">``You must let yourself down by the hands into the passage, which is about four feet high; stoop your head, walk straight along it till you come to a sharp turn which will take you to the left, and at the extreme end of it you will find a short ladder below a trap-door like this, which you will have to unbolt; that door opens into the flooring of my lady's dressing-room, which is only covered with a square Persian carpet that you can easily manage to raise. You understand me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perfectly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then take the light; Mr. Talboys will follow you. I give you twenty minutes for your inspection of the paintings--that is, about a minute apiece--and at the end of that time I shall expect to see you return.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div><p/>Robert obeyed her (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) implicitly, and George submissively following his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) friend, found himself, in five minutes, standing amidst the elegant disorder of Lady Audley's dressing-room.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) had left the house in a hurry on her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) unlooked-for journey to London, and the whole of her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) glittering toilette apparatus lay about on the marble dressing-table. The atmosphere of the room was almost oppressive for the rich odors of perfumes in bottles whose gold stoppers had not been replaced. A bunch of hot-house flowers was withering upon a tiny writing-table. Two or three handsome dresses lay in a heap upon the ground, and the open doors of a wardrobe revealed the treasures within. Jewelry, ivory-backed hair-brushes, and exquisite china were scattered here and there about the apartment. George Talboys saw his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) bearded face and tall, gaunt figure reflected in the glass, and wondered to see how out of place he (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) seemed among all these womanly luxuries.

<p/>They went from the dressing-room to the boudoir, and through the boudoir into the ante-chamber, in which there were, as Alicia had said, about twenty valuable paintings, besides my lady's portrait.

<p/>My lady's portrait stood on an easel, covered with a green baize in the center of the octagonal chamber. It had been a fancy of the artist to paint her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) standing in this very room, and to make his (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) background a faithful reproduction of the pictured walls. I am afraid the young man belonged to the pre-Raphaelite brotherhood, for he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had spent a most unconscionable time upon the accessories of this picture--upon my lady's crispy ringlets and the heavy folds of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) crimson velvet dress.

<p/>The two young men looked at the paintings on the walls first, leaving this unfinished portrait for a bonne bouche.

<p/>By this time it was dark, the candle carried by Robert only making one nucleus of light as he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) moved about holding it before the pictures one by one. The broad, bare window looked out upon the pale sky, tinged with the last cold flicker of the twilight. The ivy rustled against the glass with the same ominous shiver as that which agitated every leaf in the garden, prophetic of the storm that was to come.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There are our friend's eternal white horses,''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>said Robert, standing beside a Wouvermans. <div class="bookquote">``Nicholas Poussin--Salvator--ha--hum! Now for the portrait.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) paused with his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) hand on the baize, and solemnly addressed his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) friend.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``George Talboys,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``we have between us only one wax candle, a very inadequate light with which to look at a painting. Let me, therefore, request that you will suffer us to look at it one at a time; if there is one thing more disagreeable than another, it is to have a person dodging behind your back and peering over your shoulder, when you're trying to see what a picture's made of.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>George fell back immediately. He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) took no more interest in any lady's picture than in all the other wearinesses of this troublesome world. He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) fell back, and leaning his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) forehead against the window-panes, looked out at the night.

<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) turned round he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) saw that Robert had arranged the easel very conveniently, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) had seated himself on a chair before it for the purpose of contemplating the painting at his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) leisure.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) rose as George turned round.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, then, for your turn, Talboys,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``It's an extraordinary picture.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) took George's place at the window, and George seated himself in the chair before the easel.

<p/>Yes, the painter must have been a pre-Raphaelite. No one but a pre-Raphaelite would have painted, hair by hair, those feathery masses of ringlets, with every glimmer of gold, and every shadow of pale brown. No one but a pre-Raphaelite would have so exaggerated every attribute of that delicate face as to give a lurid brightness to the blonde complexion, and a strange, sinister light to the deep blue eyes. No one but a pre-Raphaelite could have given to that pretty pouting mouth the hard and almost wicked look it had in the portrait.

<p/>It was so like, and yet so unlike. It was as if you had burned strange-colored fires before my lady's face, and by their influence brought out new lines and new expressions never seen in it before. The perfection of feature, the brilliancy of coloring, were there; but I suppose the painter had copied quaint mediaeval monstrosities until his (<font color='blue'><b>painter</b></font>) brain had grown bewildered, for my lady, in his (<font color='blue'><b>painter</b></font>) portrait of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), had something of the aspect of a beautiful fiend.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) crimson dress, exaggerated like all the rest in this strange picture, hung about her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) in folds that looked like flames, her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) fair head peeping out of the lurid mass of color as if out of a raging furnace. Indeed the crimson dress, the sunshine on the face, the red gold gleaming in the yellow hair, the ripe scarlet of the pouting lips, the glowing colors of each accessory of the minutely painted background, all combined to render the first effect of the painting by no means an agreeable one.

<p/>But strange as the picture was, it could not have made any great impression on George Talboys, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) sat before it for about a quarter of an hour without uttering a word--only staring blankly at the painted canvas, with the candlestick grasped in his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) strong right hand, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) left arm hanging loosely by his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) side. He (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) sat so long in this attitude, that Robert turned round at last.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, George, I thought you had gone to sleep!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I had almost.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You've caught a cold from standing in that damp tapestried room. Mark my words, George Talboys, you've caught a cold; you're as hoarse as a raven. But come along.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div><p/>Robert Audley took the candle from his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) friend's hand, and crept back through the secret passage, followed by George--very quiet, but scarcely more quiet than usual.

<p/>They found Alicia in the nursery waiting for them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) said, interrogatively.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We managed it capitally. But I don't like the portrait; there's something odd about it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There is,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alicia/Miss Audley/Miss Alicia</b></font>)</div>said Alicia; <div class="bookquote">``I've a strange fancy on that point. I think that sometimes a painter is in a manner inspired, and is able to see, through the normal expression of the face, another expression that is equally a part of it, though not to be perceived by common eyes. We have never seen my lady look as she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) does in that picture; but I think that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) could look so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Alicia/Miss Audley/Miss Alicia</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Alicia,''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>said Robert Audley, imploringly, <div class="bookquote">``don't be German!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But, Robert--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't be German, Alicia, if you love me. The picture is--the picture: and my lady is--my lady. That's my way of taking things, and I'm not metaphysical; don't unsettle me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) repeated this several times with an air of terror that was perfectly sincere; and then, having borrowed an umbrella in case of being overtaken by the coming storm, left the Court, leading passive George Talboys away with him (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>). The one hand of the stupid clock had skipped to nine by the time they reached the archway; but before they could pass under its shadow they had to step aside to allow a carriage to dash past them. It was a fly from the village, but Lady Audley's fair face peeped out at the window. Dark as it was, she (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) could see the two figures of the young men black against the dusk.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who is that?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) asked, putting out her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``Is it the gardener?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, my dear aunt,''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>said Robert, laughing; <div class="bookquote">``it is your most dutiful nephew.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) and George stopped by the archway while the fly drew up at the door, and the surprised servants came out to welcome their master and mistress.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think the storm will hold off to-night,''  (<font color='red'><b>the baronet</b></font>)</div>said the baronet looking up at the sky; <div class="bookquote">``but we shall certainly have it tomorrow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the baronet</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER IX.

<p/>AFTER THE STORM.

<p/>Sir Michael was mistaken in his (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) prophecy upon the weather. The storm did not hold off until next day, but burst with terrible fury over the village of Audley about half an hour before midnight.

<p/>Robert Audley took the thunder and lightning with the same composure with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) accepted all the other ills of life. He (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) lay on a sofa in the sitting-room, ostensibly reading the five-days-old Chelmsford paper, and regaling himself occasionally with a few sips from a large tumbler of cold punch. But the storm had quite a different effect upon George Talboys. His (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) friend was startled when he (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) looked at the young man's white face as he (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) sat opposite the open window listening to the thunder, and staring at the black sky, rent every now and then by forked streaks of steel-blue lightning.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``George,''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>said Robert, after watching him (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) for some time, <div class="bookquote">``are you frightened of the lightning?''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) answered, curtly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But, dear boy, some of the most courageous men have been frightened of it. It is scarcely to be called a fear: it is constitutional. I am sure you are frightened of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I am not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But, George, if you could see yourself, white and haggard, with your great hollow eyes staring out at the sky as if they were fixed upon a ghost. I tell you I know that you are frightened.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And I tell you that I am not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``George Talboys, you are not only afraid of the lightning, but you are savage with yourself for being afraid, and with me for telling you of your fear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Robert Audley, if you say another word to me, I shall knock you down,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/George Talboys/Mr. Talboys</b></font>)</div>cried George, furiously; having said which, Mr. Talboys strode out of the room, banging the door after him (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) with a violence that shook the house. Those inky clouds, which had shut in the sultry earth as if with a roof of hot iron, poured out their blackness in a sudden deluge as George left the room; but if the young man was afraid of the lightning, he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) certainly was not afraid of the rain; for he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) walked straight down-stairs to the inn door, and went out into the wet high road. He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) walked up and down, up and down, in the soaking shower for about twenty minutes, and then, re-entering the inn, strode up to his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) bedroom.

<p/>Robert Audley met him (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) on the landing, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) hair beaten about his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) white face, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) garments dripping wet.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you going to bed, George?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you have no candle.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't want one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But look at your clothes, man! Do you see the wet streaming down your coat-sleeves? What on earth made you go out upon such a night?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am tired, and want to go to bed--don't bother me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You'll take some hot brandy-and-water, George?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div><p/>Robert Audley stood in his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) friend's way as he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) spoke, anxious to prevent his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) going to bed in the state he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) was in; but George pushed him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) fiercely aside, and, striding past him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>), said, in the same hoarse voice Robert had noticed at the Court:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let me alone, Robert Audley, and keep clear of me if you can.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div><p/>Robert followed George to his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) bedroom, but the young man banged the door in his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) face, so there was nothing for it but to leave Mr. Talboys to himself, to recover his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) temper as best he (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) might.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) was irritated at my noticing his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) terror of the lightning,''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>thought Robert, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) calmly retired to rest, serenely indifferent to the thunder, which seemed to shake him (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) bed, and the lightning playing fitfully round the razors in his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) open dressing-case.

<p/>The storm rolled away from the quiet village of Audley, and when Robert awoke the next morning it was to see bright sunshine, and a peep of cloudless sky between the white curtains of his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) bedroom window.

<p/>It was one of those serene and lovely mornings that sometimes succeed a storm. The birds sung loud and cheerily, the yellow corn uplifted itself in the broad fields, and waved proudly after its sharp tussle with the tempest, which had done its best to beat down the heavy ears with cruel wind and driving rain half the night through. The vine-leaves clustering round Robert's window fluttered with a joyous rustling, shaking the rain-drops in diamond showers from every spray and tendril.

<p/>Robert Audley found his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) friend waiting for him (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) at the breakfast-table.

<p/>George was very pale, but perfectly tranquil--if anything, indeed, more cheerful than usual.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) shook Robert by the hand with something of that hearty manner for which he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) had been distinguished before the one affliction of his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) life overtook and shipwrecked him (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Forgive me, Bob,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) said, frankly, <div class="bookquote">``for my surly temper of last night. You were quite correct in your assertion; the thunderstorm did upset me. It always had the same effect upon me in my youth.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Poor old boy! Shall we go up by the express, or shall we stop here and dine with my uncle to-night?''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>asked Robert.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``To tell the truth, Bob, I would rather do neither. It's a glorious morning. Suppose we stroll about all day, take another turn with the rod and line, and go up to town by the train that leaves here at 6.15 in the evening?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div><p/>Robert Audley would have assented to a far more disagreeable proposition than this, rather than have taken the trouble to oppose his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) friend, so the matter was immediately agreed upon; and after they had finished their breakfast, and ordered a four o'clock dinner, George Talboys took the fishing-rod across his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) broad shoulders, and strode out of the house with his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) friend and companion.

<p/>But if the equable temperament of Mr. Robert Audley had been undisturbed by the crackling peals of thunder that shook the very foundations of the Sun Inn, it had not been so with the more delicate sensibilties of his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) uncle's young wife. Lady Audley confessed herself terribly frightened of the lightning. She (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) had her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) bedstead wheeled into a corner of the room, and with the heavy curtains drawn tightly round her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) lay with her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) face buried in the pillow, shuddering convulsively at every sound of the tempest without. Sir Michael, whose stout heart had never known a fear, almost trembled for this fragile creature, whom it was his (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) happy privilege to protect and defend. My lady would not consent to undress till nearly three o'clock in the morning, when the last lingering peal of thunder had died away among the distant hills. Until that hour she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) lay in the handsome silk dress in which she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had traveled, huddled together among the bedclothes, only looking up now and then with a scared face to ask if the storm was over.

<p/>Toward four o'clock her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) husband, who spent the night in watching by her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) bedside, saw her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) drop off into a deep sleep, from which she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) did not awake for nearly five hours.

<p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) came into the breakfast-room, at half-past nine o'clock, singing a little Scotch melody, her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) cheeks tinged with as delicate a pink as the pale hue of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) muslin morning dress. Like the birds and the flowers, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) seemed to recover her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) beauty and joyousness in the morning sunshine. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) tripped lightly out onto the lawn, gathering a last lingering rosebud here and there, and a sprig or two of geranium, and returning through the dewy grass, warbling long cadences for very happiness of heart, and looking as fresh and radiant as the flowers in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) hands. The baronet caught her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) strong arms as she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) came in through the open window.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My pretty one,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``my darling, what happiness to see you your own merry self again! Do you know, Lucy, that once last night, when you looked out through the dark-green bed-curtains, with your poor, white face, and the purple rims round your hollow eyes, I had almost a difficulty to recognize my little wife in that terrified, agonized-looking creature, crying out about the storm. Thank God for the morning sun, which has brought back the rosy cheeks and bright smile! I hope to Heaven, Lucy, I shall never again see you look as you did last night.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) stood on tiptoe to kiss him (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), and then was only tall enough to reach his (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) white beard. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) told him (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), laughing, that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had always been a silly, frightened creature--frightened of dogs, frightened of cattle, frightened of a thunderstorm, frightened of a rough sea. <div class="bookquote">``Frightened of everything and everybody but my dear, noble, handsome husband,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had found the carpet in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) dressing-room disarranged, and had inquired into the mystery of the secret passage. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) chid Miss Alicia in a playful, laughing way, for her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) boldness in introducing two great men into my lady's rooms.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And they had the audacity to look at my picture, Alicia,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said, with mock indignation. <div class="bookquote">``I found the baize thrown on the ground, and a great man's glove on the carpet. Look!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``She (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) held up a thick driving glove as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) spoke. It was George's, which he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) had dropped looking at the picture.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall go up to the Sun, and ask those boys to dinner,''  (<font color='red'><b>Michael/Michael Audley/Audley</b></font>)</div>Sir Michael said, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) left the Court upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) morning walk around his (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) farm.

<p/>Lady Audley flitted from room to room in the bright September sunshine--now sitting down to the piano to trill out a ballad, or the first page of an Italian bravura, or running with rapid fingers through a brilliant waltz--now hovering about a stand of hot-house flowers, doing amateur gardening with a pair of fairy-like, silver-mounted embroidery scissors--now strolling into her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) dressing-room to talk to Phoebe Marks, and have her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) curls rearranged for the third or fourth time; for the ringlets were always getting into disorder, and gave no little trouble to Lady Audley's maid.

<p/>My dear lady seemed, on this particular September day, restless from very joyousness of spirit, and unable to stay long in one place, or occupy herself with one thing.

<p/>While Lady Audley amused herself in her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) own frivolous fashion, the two young men strolled slowly along the margin of the stream until they reached a shady corner where the water was deep and still, and the long branches of the willows trailed into the brook.

<p/>George Talboys took the fishing-rod, while Robert stretched himself at full length on a railway rug, and balancing his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) hat upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) nose as a screen from the sunshine, fell fast asleep.

<p/>Those were happy fish in the stream on the banks of which Mr. Talboys was seated. They might have amused themselves to their hearts' content with timid nibbles at this gentleman's bait without in any manner endangering their safety; for George only stared vacantly in the water, holding his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) rod in a loose, listless hand, and with a strange, far-away look in his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) eyes. As the church clock struck two he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) threw down his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) rod, and, striding away along the bank, left Robert Audley to enjoy a nap which, according to that gentleman's habits, was by no means unlikely to last for two or three hours. About a quarter of a mile further on George crossed a rustic bridge, and struck into the meadows which led to Audley Court.

<p/>The birds had sung so much all the morning, that they had, perhaps, by this time grown tired; the lazy cattle were asleep in the meadows; Sir Michael was still away on his (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) morning's ramble; Miss Alicia had scampered off an hour before on her (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) chestnut mare; the servants were all at dinner in the back part of the house; and my lady had strolled, book in hand, into the shadowy lime-walk; so the gray old building had never worn a more peaceful aspect than on that bright afternoon when George Talboys walked across the lawn to ring a sonorous peal at the sturdy, iron-bound oak door.

<p/>The servant who answered his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) summons told him (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) that Sir Michael was out, and my lady walking in the lime-tree avenue.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) looked a little disappointed at this intelligence, and muttering something about wishing to see my lady, or going to look for my lady -LRB-the servant did not clearly distinguish his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) words-RRB-, strode away from the door without leaving either card or message for the family.

<p/>It was full an hour and a half after this when Lady Audley returned to the house, not coming from the lime-walk, but from exactly the opposite direction, carrying her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) open book in her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) hand, and singing as she (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) came. Alicia had just dismounted from her (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) mare, and stood in the low-arched doorway, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) great Newfoundland dog by her (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) side.

<p/>The dog, which had never liked my lady, showed his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) teeth with a suppressed growl.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Send that horrid animal away, Alicia,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Audley/LADY AUDLEY</b></font>)</div>Lady Audley said, impatiently. <div class="bookquote">``The brute knows that I am frightened of him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>), and takes advantage of my terror. And yet they call the creatures generous and noble-hearted! Bah, Caesar! I hate you, and you hate me; and if you met me in the dark in some narrow passage you would fly at my throat and strangle me, wouldn't you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>lady</b></font>)</div><p/>My lady, safely sheltered behind her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) step-daughter, shook her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) yellow curls at the angry animal, and defied him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) maliciously.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you know, Lady Audley, that Mr. Talboys, the young widower, has been here asking for Sir Michael and you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lucy Audley</b></font>)</div><p/>Lucy Audley lifted her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) penciled eyebrows. <div class="bookquote">``I thought they were coming to dinner,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Surely we shall have enough of them then.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had a heap of wild autumn flowers in the skirt of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) muslin dress. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had come through the fields at the back of the Court, gathering the hedge-row blossoms in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) way. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) ran lightly up the broad staircase to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) own rooms. George's glove lay on her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) boudoir table. Lady Audley rung the bell violently, and it was answered by Phoebe Marks. <div class="bookquote">``Take that litter away,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Marks</b></font>) said, sharply. The girl collected the glove and a few withered flowers and torn papers lying on the table into her (<font color='blue'><b>Marks</b></font>) apron.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What have you been doing all this morning?''  (<font color='red'><b>lady</b></font>)</div>asked my lady. <div class="bookquote">``Not wasting your time, I hope?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, my lady, I have been altering the blue dress. It is rather dark on this side of the house, so I took it up to my own room, and worked at the window.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The girl</b></font>)</div><p/>The girl was leaving the room as she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) spoke, but she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) turned around and looked at Lady Audley as if waiting for further orders.

<p/>Lucy looked up at the same moment, and the eyes of the two women met.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Phoebe Marks,''  (<font color='red'><b>lady girl</b></font>)</div>said my lady, throwing herself into an easy-chair, and trifling with the wild flowers in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) lap, <div class="bookquote">``you are a good, industrious girl, and while I live and am prosperous, you shall never want a firm friend or a twenty-pound note.''

 (<font color='red'><b>lady girl</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER X.

<p/>MISSING.

<p/>When Robert Audley awoke he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) was surprised to see the fishing-rod lying on the bank, the line trailing idly in the water, and the float bobbing harmlessly up and down in the afternoon sunshine. The young barrister was a long time stretching his (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) arms and legs in various directions to convince himself, by means of such exercise, that he (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) still retained the proper use of those members; then, with a mighty effort, he (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) contrived to rise from the grass, and having deliberately folded his (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) railway rug into a convenient shape for carrying over his (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) shoulder, he (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) strolled away to look for George Talboys.

<p/>Once or twice he (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) gave a sleepy shout, scarcely loud enough to scare the birds in the branches above his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) head, or the trout in the stream at his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) feet: but receiving no answer, grew tired of the exertion, and dawdled on, yawning as he (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) went, and still looking for George Talboys.

<p/>By-and-by he (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) took out his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) watch, and was surprised to find that it was a quarter past four.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, the selfish beggar must have gone home to his (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>) dinner!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) muttered, reflectively; <div class="bookquote">``and yet that isn't much like him (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>), for he (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>) seldom remembers even his (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>) meals unless I jog his (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>) memory.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Even a good appetite, and the knowledge that his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) dinner would very likely suffer by this delay, could not quicken Mr. Robert Audley's constitutional dawdle, and by the time he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) strolled in at the front door of the Sun, the clocks were striking five. He (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) so fully expected to find George Talboys waiting for him (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) in the little sitting-room, that the absence of that gentleman seemed to give the apartment a dreary look, and Robert groaned aloud.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This is lively!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``A cold dinner, and nobody to eat it with!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The landlord of the Sun came himself to apologize for his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) ruined dishes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``As fine a pair of ducks, Mr. Audley, as ever you clapped eyes on, but burnt up to a cinder, along of being kep' hot.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never mind the ducks,''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>Robert said impatiently; <div class="bookquote">``where's Mr. Talboys?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) ain't been in, sir, since you went out together this morning.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What!''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>cried Robert. <div class="bookquote">``Why, in heaven's name, what has the man done with himself?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) walked to the window and looked out upon the broad, white high road. There was a wagon laden with trusses of hay crawling slowly past, the lazy horses and the lazy wagoner drooping their heads with a weary stoop under the afternoon's sunshine. There was a flock of sheep straggling about the road, with a dog running himself into a fever in the endeavor to keep them decently together. There were some bricklayers just released from work--a tinker mending some kettles by the roadside; there was a dog-cart dashing down the road, carrying the master of the Audley hounds to his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) seven o'clock dinner; there were a dozen common village sights and sounds that mixed themselves up into a cheerful bustle and confusion; but there was no George Talboys.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of all the extraordinary things that ever happened to me in the whole course of my life,''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Robert Audley, <div class="bookquote">``this is the most miraculous!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div><p/>The landlord still in attendance, opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) eyes as Robert made this remark. What could there be extraordinary in the simple fact of a gentleman being late for his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) dinner?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall go and look for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>said Robert, snatching up his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) hat and walking straight out of the house.

<p/>But the question was where to look for him (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) certainly was not by the trout stream, so it was no good going back there in search of him (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>). Robert was standing before the inn, deliberating on what was best to be done, when the landlord came out after him (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I forgot to tell you, Mr. Audley, as how your uncle called here five minutes after you was gone, and left a message, asking of you and the other gentleman to go down to dinner at the Court.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then I shouldn't wonder,''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>said Robert, <div class="bookquote">``if George Talboys has gone down to the Court to call upon my uncle. It isn't like him (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>), but it's just possible that he (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) has done it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div><p/>It was six o'clock when Robert knocked at the door of his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) uncle's house. He (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) did not ask to see any of the family, but inquired at once for his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) friend.

<p/>Yes, the servant told him (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>); Mr. Talboys had been there at two o'clock or a little after.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And not since?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, not since.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/>Was the man sure that it was at two Mr. Talboys called? Robert asked.

<p/>Yes, perfectly sure. He (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) remembered the hour because it was the servants' dinner hour, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) had left the table to open the door to Mr. Talboys.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, what can have become of the man?''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>thought Robert, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) back upon the Court. <div class="bookquote">``From two till six--four good hours--and no signs of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div><p/>If any one had ventured to tell Mr. Robert Audley that he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) could possibly feel a strong attachment to any creature breathing, that cynical gentleman would have elevated his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) eyebrows in supreme contempt at the preposterous notion. Yet here he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was, flurried and anxious, bewildering his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) brain by all manner of conjectures about his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) missing friend; and false to every attribute of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) nature, walking fast.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I haven't walked fast since I was at Eton,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) murmured, as he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) hurried across one of Sir Michael's meadows in the direction of the village; <div class="bookquote">``and the worst of it is, that I haven't the most remote idea where I am going.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Michael/Michael Audley/Audley</b></font>)</div><p/>Here he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) crossed another meadow, and then seating himself upon a stile, rested his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) elbows upon his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) knees, buried his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) face in his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) hands, and set himself seriously to think the matter out.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) said, after a few minutes' thought; <div class="bookquote">``the railway station!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) sprang over the stile, and started off in the direction of the little red brick building.

<p/>There was no train expected for another half hour, and the clerk was taking his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) tea in an apartment on one side of the office, on the door of which was inscribed in large, white letters, <div class="bookquote">``Private.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the clerk</b></font>)</div><p/>But Mr. Audley was too much occupied with the one idea of looking for his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) friend to pay any attention to this warning. He (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) strode at once to the door, and rattling his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) cane against it, brought the clerk out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) sanctum in a perspiration from hot tea, and with his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) mouth full of bread and butter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you remember the gentleman that came down to Audley with me, Smithers?''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>asked Robert.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, to tell you the real truth, Mr. Audley, I can't say that I do. You came by the four o'clock, if you remember, and there's always a good many passengers by that train.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't remember him (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>), then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not to my knowledge, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's provoking! I want to know, Smithers, whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Smithers</b></font>) has taken a ticket for London since two o'clock to-day. He (<font color='blue'><b>Smithers</b></font>)'s a tall, broad-chested young fellow, with a big brown beard. You couldn't well mistake him (<font color='blue'><b>Smithers</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There was four or five gentlemen as took tickets for the 3.30 up,''  (<font color='red'><b>the clerk</b></font>)</div>said the clerk rather vaguely, casting an anxious glance over his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) shoulder at his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) wife, who looked by no means pleased at this interruption to the harmony of the tea-table.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Four or five gentlemen! But did either of them answer to the description of my friend?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I think one of them had a beard, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A dark-brown beard?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I don't know, but it was brownish-like.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Was he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) dressed in gray?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I believe it was gray; a great many gents wear gray. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) asked for the ticket sharp and short-like, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)'d got it walked straight out onto the platform whistling.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's George,''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>said Robert. <div class="bookquote">``Thank you, Smithers; I needn't trouble you any more. It's as clear as daylight,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) muttered, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) left the station; <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Smithers</b></font>)'s got one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Smithers</b></font>) gloomy fits on him (<font color='blue'><b>Smithers</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Smithers</b></font>)'s gone back to London without saying a word about it. I'll leave Audley myself to-morrow morning; and for to-night--why, I may as well go down to the Court and make the acquaintance of my uncle's young wife. They don't dine till seven; if I get back across the fields I shall be in time. Bob--otherwise Robert Audley--this sort of thing will never do; you are falling over head and ears in love with your aunt.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER XI.

<p/>THE MARK UPON MY LADY``S WRIST.

<p/>Robert found Sir Michael and Lady Audley in the drawing-room. My lady was sitting on a music-stool before the grand piano, turning over the leaves of some new music. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) twirled upon the revolving seat, making a rustling with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) silk flounces, as Mr. Robert Audley's name was announced; then, leaving the piano, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) made her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) nephew a pretty, mock ceremonious courtesy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you so much for the sables,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>LADY</b></font>) said, holding out her (<font color='blue'><b>LADY</b></font>) little fingers, all glittering and twinkling with the diamonds she (<font color='blue'><b>LADY</b></font>) wore upon them; <div class="bookquote">``thank you for those beautiful sables. How good it was of you to get them for me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Robert had almost forgotten the commission he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) had executed for Lady Audley during his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) Russian expedition. His (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) mind was so full of George Talboys that he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) only acknowledged my lady's gratitude by a bow.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Would you believe it, Sir Michael?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``That foolish chum of mine has gone back to London leaving me in the lurch.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. George Talboys returned to town?''  (<font color='red'><b>lady</b></font>)</div>exclaimed my lady, lifting her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) eyebrows. <div class="bookquote">``What a dreadful catastrophe!''  (<font color='red'><b>Alicia/Miss Audley/Miss Alicia</b></font>)</div>said Alicia, maliciously, <div class="bookquote">``since Pythias, in the person of Mr. Robert Audley, cannot exist for half an hour without Damon, commonly known as George Talboys.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Alicia/Miss Audley/Miss Alicia</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>)'s a very good fellow,''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>Robert said, stoutly; <div class="bookquote">``and to tell the honest truth, I'm rather uneasy about him (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Uneasy about him (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>lady</b></font>)</div>My lady was quite anxious to know why Robert was uneasy about his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) friend.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll tell you why, Lady Audley,''  (<font color='red'><b>the barrister</b></font>)</div>answered the young barrister. <div class="bookquote">``George had a bitter blow a year ago in the death of his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) wife. He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) has never got over that trouble. He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) takes life pretty quietly--almost as quietly as I do--but he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) often talks very strangely, and I sometimes think that one day this grief will get the better of him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) will do something rash.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Robert Audley spoke vaguely, but all three of his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) listeners knew that the something rash to which he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) alluded was that one deed for which there is no repentance.

<p/>There was a brief pause, during which Lady Audley arranged her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) yellow ringlets by the aid of the glass over the console table opposite to her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear me!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``this is very strange. I did not think men were capable of these deep and lasting affections. I thought that one pretty face was as good as another pretty face to them; and that when number one with blue eyes and fair hair died, they had only to look out for number two, with dark eyes and black hair, by way of variety.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``George Talboys is not one of those men. I firmly believe that his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) wife's death broke his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) heart.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How sad!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Audley/LADY AUDLEY</b></font>)</div>murmured Lady Audley. <div class="bookquote">``It seems almost cruel of Mrs. Talboys to die, and grieve her (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) poor husband so much.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Alicia was right, she (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) is childish,''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>thought Robert as he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) aunt's pretty face.

<p/>My lady was very charming at the dinner-table; she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) professed the most bewitching incapacity for carving the pheasant set before her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), and called Robert to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) assistance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I could carve a leg of mutton at Mr. Dawson's,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said, laughing; <div class="bookquote">``but a leg of mutton is so easy, and then I used to stand up.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Sir Michael watched the impression my lady made upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) nephew with a proud delight in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) beauty and fascination.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am so glad to see my poor little woman in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) usual good spirits once more,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was very down-hearted yesterday at a disappointment she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) met with in London.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A disappointment!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Mr. Audley, a very cruel one,''  (<font color='red'><b>lady</b></font>)</div>answered my lady. <div class="bookquote">``I received the other morning a telegraphic message from my dear old friend and school-mistress, telling me that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was dying, and that if I wanted to see her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) again, I must hasten to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) immediately. The telegraphic dispatch contained no address, and of course, from that very circumstance, I imagined that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) must be living in the house in which I left her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) three years ago. Sir Michael and I hurried up to town immediately, and drove straight to the old address. The house was occupied by strange people, who could give me no tidings of my friend. It is in a retired place, where there are very few tradespeople about. Sir Michael made inquiries at the few shops there are, but, after taking an immense deal of trouble, could discover nothing whatever likely to lead to the information we wanted. I have no friends in London, and had therefore no one to assist me except my dear, generous husband, who did all in his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) power, but in vain, to find my friend's new residence.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It was very foolish not to send the address in the telegraphic message,''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>said Robert.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``When people are dying it is not so easy to think of all these things,''  (<font color='red'><b>lady</b></font>)</div>murmured my lady, looking reproachfully at Mr. Audley with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) soft blue eyes.

<p/>In spite of Lady Audley's fascination, and in spite of Robert's very unqualified admiration of her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>), the barrister could not overcome a vague feeling of uneasiness on this quiet September evening.

<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) sat in the deep embrasure of a mullioned window, talking to my lady, his (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) mind wandered away to shady Figtree Court, and he (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) thought of poor George Talboys smoking his (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) solitary cigar in the room with the birds and canaries.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish I'd never felt any friendliness for the fellow,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) thought. <div class="bookquote">``I feel like a man who has an only son whose life has gone wrong with him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>). I wish to Heaven I could give him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) back his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) wife, and send him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) down to Ventnor to finish his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) days in peace.''

 (<font color='red'><b>lady</b></font>)</div><p/>Still my lady's pretty musical prattle ran on as merrily and continuously as the babble in some brook; and still Robert's thoughts wandered, in spite of himself, to George Talboys.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) thought of him (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) hurrying down to Southampton by the mail train to see his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) boy. He (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) thought of him (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) had often seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) spelling over the shipping advertisements in the Times, looking for a vessel to take him (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) back to Australia. Once he (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) thought of him (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) with a shudder, lying cold and stiff at the bottom of some shallow stream with his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) dead face turned toward the darkening sky.

<p/>Lady Audley noticed his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) abstraction, and asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) what he (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) was thinking of.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``George Talboys,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) answered abruptly.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) gave a little nervous shudder.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Upon my word,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``you make me quite uncomfortable by the way in which you talk of Mr. Talboys. One would think that something extraordinary had happened to him (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``God forbid! But I cannot help feeling uneasy about him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Michael/Michael Audley/Audley</b></font>)</div><p/>Later in the evening Sir Michael asked for some music, and my lady went to the piano. Robert Audley strolled after her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) to the instrument to turn over the leaves of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) music; but she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) played from memory, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) was spared the trouble his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) gallantry would have imposed upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>).

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) carried a pair of lighted candles to the piano, and arranged them conveniently for the pretty musician. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) struck a few chords, and then wandered into a pensive sonata of Beethoven's. It was one of the many paradoxes in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) character, that love of somber and melancholy melodies, so opposite to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) gay nature.

<p/>Robert Audley lingered by her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) side, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) had no occupation in turning over the leaves of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) music, he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) amused himself by watching her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) jeweled, white hands gliding softly over the keys, with the lace sleeves dropping away from, her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) graceful, arched wrists. He (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) pretty fingers one by one; this one glittering with a ruby heart; that encircled by an emerald serpent; and about them all a starry glitter of diamonds. From the fingers his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) eyes wandered to the rounded wrists: the broad, flat, gold bracelet upon her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) right wrist dropped over her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) hand, as she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) executed a rapid passage. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) stopped abruptly to rearrange it; but before she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) could do so Robert Audley noticed a bruise upon her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) delicate skin.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You have hurt your arm, Lady Audley!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) exclaimed. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) hastily replaced the bracelet.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is nothing,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I am unfortunate in having a skin which the slightest touch bruises.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) went on playing, but Sir Michael came across the room to look into the matter of the bruise upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) wife's pretty wrist.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is it, Lucy?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) asked; <div class="bookquote">``and how did it happen?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How foolish you all are to trouble yourselves about anything so absurd!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Audley/LADY AUDLEY</b></font>)</div>said Lady Audley, laughing. <div class="bookquote">``I am rather absent in mind, and amused myself a few days ago by tying a piece of ribbon around my arm so tightly, that it left a bruise when I removed it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hum!''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>thought Robert. <div class="bookquote">``My lady tells little childish white lies; the bruise is of a more recent date than a few days ago; the skin has only just begun to change color.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Michael/Michael Audley/Audley</b></font>)</div><p/>Sir Michael took the slender wrist in his (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) strong hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hold the candle, Robert,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``and let us look at this poor little arm.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>It was not one bruise, but four slender, purple marks, such as might have been made by the four fingers of a powerful hand, that had grasped the delicate wrist a shade too roughly. A narrow ribbon, bound tightly, might have left some such marks, it is true, and my lady protested once more that, to the best of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) recollection, that must have been how they were made.

<p/>Across one of the faint purple marks there was a darker tinge, as if a ring worn on one of those strong and cruel fingers had been ground into the tender flesh.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sure my lady must tell white lies,''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>thought Robert, <div class="bookquote">``for I can't believe the story of the ribbon.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) wished his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) relations good-night and good-by at about half past ten o'clock; he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) should run up to London by the first train to look for George in Figtree Court.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If I don't find him (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) there I shall go to Southampton,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``and if I don't find him (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) there--''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What then?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>asked my lady.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall think that something strange has happened.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div><p/>Robert Audley felt very low-spirited as he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) walked slowly home between the shadowy meadows; more low-spirited still when he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) re-entered the sitting room at Sun Inn, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) and George had lounged together, staring out of the window and smoking their cigars.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``To think,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) said, meditatively, <div class="bookquote">``that it is possible to care so much for a fellow! But come what may, I'll go up to town after him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) the first thing to-morrow morning; and, sooner than be balked in finding him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>), I'll go to the very end of the world.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>With Mr. Audley's lymphatic nature, determination was so much the exception rather than the rule, that when he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) did for once in his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) life resolve upon any course of action, he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) had a certain dogged, iron-like obstinacy that pushed him (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) on to the fulfillment of his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) purpose.

<p/>The lazy bent of his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) mind, which prevented him (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) from thinking of half a dozen things at a time, and not thinking thoroughly of any one of them, as is the manner of your more energetic people, made him (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) remarkably clear-sighted upon any point to which he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) ever gave his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) serious attention.

<p/>Indeed, after all, though solemn benchers laughed at him (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>), and rising barristers shrugged their shoulders under rustling silk gowns, when people spoke of Robert Audley, I doubt if, had he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) ever taken the trouble to get a brief, he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) might not have rather surprised the magnates who underrated his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) abilities.

<p/>CHAPTER XII.

<p/>STILL MISSING.

<p/>The September sunlight sparkled upon the fountain in the Temple Gardens when Robert Audley returned to Figtree Court early the following morning.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) found the canaries singing in the pretty little room in which George had slept, but the apartment was in the same prim order in which the laundress had arranged it after the departure of the two young men--not a chair displaced, or so much as the lid of a cigar-box lifted, to bespeak the presence of George Talboys. With a last, lingering hope, he (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) searched upon the mantelpieces and tables of his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) rooms, on the chance of finding some letter left by George.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) may have slept here last night, and started for Southampton early this morning,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) thought. <div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Maloney has been here, very likely, to make everything tidy after him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>But as he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) sat looking lazily around the room, now and then whistling to his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) delighted canaries, a slipshod foot upon the staircase without bespoke the advent of that very Mrs. Maloney who waited upon the two young men.

<p/>No, Mr. Talboys had not come home; she (<font color='blue'><b>Maloney</b></font>) had looked in as early as six o'clock that morning, and found the chambers empty.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Had anything happened to the poor, dear gentleman?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maloney</b></font>) asked, seeing Robert Audley's pale face.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) turned around upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Maloney</b></font>) quite savagely at this question.

<p/>Happened to him (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>)! What should happen to him (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>)? They had only parted at two o'clock the day before.

<p/>Mrs. Maloney would have related to him (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) the history of a poor dear young engine-driver, who had once lodged with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maloney</b></font>), and who went out, after eating a hearty dinner, in the best of spirits, to meet with his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) death from the concussion of an express and a luggage train; but Robert put on his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) hat again, and walked straight out of the house before the honest Irishwoman could begin her (<font color='blue'><b>Maloney</b></font>) pitiful story.

<p/>It was growing dusk when he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) reached Southampton. He (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) knew his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) way to the poor little terrace of houses, in a full street leading down to the water, where George's father-in-law lived. Little Georgey was playing at the open parlor window as the young man walked down the street.

<p/>Perhaps it was this fact, and the dull and silent aspect of the house, which filled Robert Audley's mind with a vague conviction that the man he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) came to look for was not there. The old man himself opened the door, and the child peeped out of the parlor to see the strange gentleman.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was a handsome boy, with his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) father's brown eyes and dark waving hair, and with some latent expression which was not his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) father's and which pervaded his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) whole face, so that although each feature of the child resembled the same feature in George Talboys, the boy was not actually like him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>).

<p/>Mr. Maldon was delighted to see Robert Audley; he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) remembered having had the pleasure of meeting him (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) at Ventnor, on the melancholy occasion of--He (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) wiped his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) watery old eyes by way of conclusion to the sentence. Would Mr. Audley walk in? Robert strode into the parlor. The furniture was shabby and dingy, and the place reeked with the smell of stale tobacco and brandy-and-water. The boy's broken playthings, and the old man's broken clay pipes and torn, brandy-and-water-stained newspapers were scattered upon the dirty carpet. Little Georgey crept toward the visitor, watching him (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) furtively out of his (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) big, brown eyes. Robert took the boy on his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) knee, and gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) watch-chain to play with while he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) talked to the old man.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I need scarcely ask the question that I come to ask,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``I was in hopes I should have found your son-in-law here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What! you knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>son-in-law</b></font>) was coming to Southampton?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>son-in-law</b></font>) was coming?''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>cried Robert, brightening up. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>son-in-law</b></font>) is here, then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, he (<font color='blue'><b>son-in-law</b></font>) is not here now; but he (<font color='blue'><b>son-in-law</b></font>) has been here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``When?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Late last night; he (<font color='blue'><b>son-in-law</b></font>) came by the mail.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And left again immediately?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>son-in-law</b></font>) stayed little better than an hour.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good Heaven!''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>said Robert, <div class="bookquote">``what useless anxiety that man has given me! What can be the meaning of all this?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You knew nothing of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) intention, then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of what intention?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I mean of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) determination to go to Australia.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know that it was always in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mind more or less, but not more just now than usual.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sails to-night from Liverpool. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) came here at one o'clock this morning to have a look at the boy, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) said, before he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) left England, perhaps never to return. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) told me he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was sick of the world, and that the rough life out there was the only thing to suit him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) stayed an hour, kissed the boy without awaking him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), and left Southampton by the mail that starts at a quarter-past two.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What can be the meaning of all this?''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>said Robert. <div class="bookquote">``What could be his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) motive for leaving England in this manner, without a word to me, his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) most intimate friend--without even a change of clothes; for he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) has left everything at my chambers? It is the most extraordinary proceeding!''

 (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div><p/>The old man looked very grave. <div class="bookquote">``Do you know, Mr. Audley,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) said, tapping his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) forehead significantly, <div class="bookquote">``I sometimes fancy that Helen's death had a strange effect upon poor George.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pshaw!''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>cried Robert, contemptuously; <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) felt the blow most cruelly, but his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) brain was as sound as yours or mine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) will write to you from Liverpool,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/George Talboys/Mr. Talboys</b></font>)</div>said George's father-in-law. He (<font color='blue'><b>father-in-law</b></font>) seemed anxious to smooth over any indignation that Robert might feel at his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) friend's conduct.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) ought,''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>said Robert, gravely, <div class="bookquote">``for we've been good friends from the days when we were together at Eton. It isn't kind of George Talboys to treat me like this.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div><p/>But even at the moment that he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) uttered the reproach a strange thrill of remorse shot through his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) heart.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It isn't like him (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``it isn't like George Talboys.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Little Georgey caught at the sound. <div class="bookquote">``That's my name,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``and my papa's name--the big gentleman's name.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, little Georgey, and your papa came last night and kissed you in your sleep. Do you remember?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div>said the boy, shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) curly little head.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You must have been very fast asleep, little Georgey, not to see poor papa.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The child</b></font>)</div><p/>The child did not answer, but presently, fixing his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) eyes upon Robert's face, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) said abruptly:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where's the pretty lady?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What pretty lady?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The pretty lady that used to come a long while ago.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Georgey</b></font>) means his (<font color='blue'><b>Georgey</b></font>) poor mamma,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the old man.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div>cried the boy resolutely, <div class="bookquote">``not mamma. Mamma was always crying. I didn't like mamma--''

 (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hush, little Georgey!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I didn't, and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) didn't like me. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was always crying. I mean the pretty lady; the lady that was dressed so fine, and that gave me my gold watch.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Georgey</b></font>) means the wife of my old captain--an excellent creature, who took a great fancy to Georgey, and gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Georgey</b></font>) some handsome presents.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Where's my gold watch? Let me show the gentleman my gold watch,''  (<font color='red'><b>Georgey/Master Georgey</b></font>)</div>cried Georgey.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's gone to be cleaned, Georgey,''  (<font color='red'><b>grandfather</b></font>)</div>answered his (<font color='blue'><b>Georgey</b></font>) grandfather.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's always going to be cleaned,''  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div>said the boy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The watch is perfectly safe, I assure you, Mr. Audley,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>murmured the old man, apologetically; and taking out a pawnbroker's duplicate, he (<font color='blue'><b>Georgey</b></font>) handed it to Robert.

<p/>It was made out in the name of Captain Mortimer: <div class="bookquote">``Watch, set with diamonds, #11.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Captain Mortimer</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm often hard pressed for a few shillings, Mr. Audley,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the old man. <div class="bookquote">``My son-in-law has been very liberal to me; but there are others, there are others, Mr. Audley--and--and--I've not been treated well.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wiped away some genuine tears as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said this in a pitiful, crying voice. <div class="bookquote">``Come, Georgey, it's time the brave little man was in bed. Come along with grandpa. Excuse me for a quarter of an hour, Mr. Audley.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The boy</b></font>)</div><p/>The boy went very willingly. At the door of the room the old man looked back at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) visitor, and said in the same peevish voice, <div class="bookquote">``This is a poor place for me to pass my declining years in, Mr. Audley. I've made many sacrifices, and I make them still, but I've not been treated well.''

 (<font color='red'><b>visitor</b></font>)</div><p/>Left alone in the dusky little sitting-room, Robert Audley folded his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) arms, and sat absently staring at the floor.

<p/>George was gone, then; he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) might receive some letter of explanation perhaps, when he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) returned to London; but the chances were that he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) would never see his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) old friend again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And to think that I should care so much for the fellow!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) said, lifting his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) eyebrows to the center of his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) forehead.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The place smells of stale tobacco like a tap-room,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) muttered presently; <div class="bookquote">``there can be no harm in my smoking a cigar here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) took one from the case in his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) pocket: there was a spark of fire in the little grate, and he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) looked about for something to light his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) cigar with.

<p/>A twisted piece of paper lay half burned upon the hearthrug; he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) picked it up, and unfolded it, in order to get a better pipe-light by folding it the other way of the paper. As he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) did so, absently glancing at the penciled writing upon the fragment of thin paper, a portion of a name caught his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) eye--a portion of the name that was most in his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) thoughts. He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) took the scrap of paper to the window, and examined it by the declining light.

<p/>It was part of a telegraphic dispatch. The upper portion had been burnt away, but the more important part, the greater part of the message itself, remained.

<p/><div class="bookquote">''--alboys came to ---- last night, and left by the mail for London, on his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) way to Liverpool, whence he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) was to sail for Sydney.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The date and the name and address of the sender of the message had been burnt with the heading. Robert Audley's face blanched to a deathly whiteness. He (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) carefully folded the scrap of paper, and placed it between the leaves of his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) pocket-book.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My God!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``what is the meaning of this? I shall go to Liverpool to-night, and make inquiries there!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER XIII.

<p/>TROUBLED DREAMS.

<p/>Robert Audley left Southampton by the mail, and let himself into his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) chambers just as the dawn was creeping cold and gray into the solitary rooms, and the canaries were beginning to rustle their feathers feebly in the early morning.

<p/>There were several letters in the box behind the door, but there was none from George Talboys.

<p/>The young barrister was worn out by a long day spent in hurrying from place to place. The usual lazy monotony of his (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) life had been broken as it had never been broken before in eight-and-twenty tranquil, easy-going years. His (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) mind was beginning to grow confused upon the point of time. It seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) months since he (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) had lost sight of George Talboys. It was so difficult to believe that it was less than forty-eight hours ago that the young man had left him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) asleep under the willows by the trout stream.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes were painfully weary for want of sleep. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) searched about the room for some time, looking in all sorts of impossible places for a letter from George Talboys, and then threw himself dressed upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) friend's bed, in the room with the canaries and geraniums.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall wait for to-morrow morning's post,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``and if that brings no letter from George, I shall start for Liverpool without a moment's delay.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) was thoroughly exhausted, and fell into a heavy sleep--a sleep which was profound without being in any way refreshing, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) was tormented all the time by disagreeable dreams--dreams which were painful, not from any horror in themselves, but from a vague and wearying sense of their confusion and absurdity.

<p/>At one time he (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) was pursuing strange people and entering strange houses in the endeavor to unravel the mystery of the telegraphic dispatch; at another time he (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) was in the church-yard at Ventnor, gazing at the headstone George had ordered for the grave of his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) dead wife. Once in the long, rambling mystery of these dreams he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) went to the grave, and found this headstone gone, and on remonstrating with the stonemason, was told that the man had a reason for removing the inscription; a reason that Robert would some day learn.

<p/>In another dream he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) saw the grave of Helen Talboys open, and while he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) waited, with the cold horror lifting up his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) hair, to see the dead woman rise and stand before him (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) stiff, charnel-house drapery clinging about her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) rigid limbs, his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) uncle's wife tripped gaily out of the open grave, dressed in the crimson velvet robes in which the artist had painted her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), and with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) ringlets flashing like red gold in the unearthly light that shone about her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).

<p/>But into all these dreams the places he (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) had last been in, and the people with whom he (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) had last been concerned, were dimly interwoven--sometimes his (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) uncle; sometimes Alicia; oftenest of all my lady; the trout stream in Essex; the lime-walk at the Court. Once he (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) was walking in the black shadows of this long avenue, with Lady Audley hanging on his (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) arm, when suddenly they heard a great knocking in the distance, and his (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) uncle's wife wound her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) slender arms around him (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>), crying out that it was the day of judgment, and that all wicked secrets must now be told. Looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) shrieked this in his (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) ear, he (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) saw that her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) face had grown ghastly white, and that her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) beautiful golden ringlets were changing into serpents, and slowly creeping down her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) fair neck.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) started from his (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) dream to find that there was some one really knocking at the outer door of his (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) chambers.

<p/>It was a dreary, wet morning, the rain beating against the windows, and the canaries twittering dismally to each other--complaining, perhaps, of the bad weather. Robert could not tell how long the person had been knocking. He (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) had mixed the sound with his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) dreams, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) woke he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) was only half conscious of other things.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's that stupid Mrs. Maloney, I dare say,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) muttered. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Maloney</b></font>) may knock again for all I care. Why can't she (<font color='blue'><b>Maloney</b></font>) use her (<font color='blue'><b>Maloney</b></font>) duplicate key, instead of dragging a man out of bed when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s half dead with fatigue.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The person</b></font>)</div><p/>The person, whoever it was, did knock again, and then desisted, apparently tired out; but about a minute afterward a key turned in the door.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Maloney</b></font>) had her (<font color='blue'><b>Maloney</b></font>) key with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maloney</b></font>) all the time, then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>said Robert. <div class="bookquote">``I'm very glad I didn't get up.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The door between the sitting-room and bed-room was half open, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) could see the laundress bustling about, dusting the furniture, and rearranging things that had never been disarranged.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is that you, Mrs. Maloney?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir,''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then why, in goodness' name, did you make that row at the door, when you had a key with you all the time?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A row at the door, sir?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; that infernal knocking.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sure I never knocked, Mister Audley, but walked straight in with my kay--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then who did knock? There's been some one kicking up a row at that door for a quarter of an hour, I should think; you must have met him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) going down-stairs.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I'm rather late this morning, sir, for I've been in Mr. Martin's rooms first, and I've come straight from the floor above.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then you didn't see any one at the door, or on the stairs?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not a mortal soul, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Was ever anything so provoking?''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>said Robert. <div class="bookquote">``To think that I should have let this person go away without ascertaining who he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) was, or what he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) wanted! How do I know that it was not some one with a message or a letter from George Talboys?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sure if it was, sir, he (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>)'ll come again,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Maloney</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Maloney, soothingly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, of course, if it was anything of consequence he (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>)'ll come again,''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>muttered Robert. The fact was, that from the moment of finding the telegraphic message at Southampton, all hope of hearing of George had faded out of his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) mind. He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) felt that there was some mystery involved in the disappearance of his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) friend--some treachery toward himself, or toward George. What if the young man's greedy old father-in-law had tried to separate them on account of the monetary trust lodged in Robert Audley's hands? Or what if, since even in these civilized days all kinds of unsuspected horrors are constantly committed--what if the old man had decoyed George down to Southampton, and made away with him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) in order to get possession of that #20,000, left in Robert's custody for little Georgey's use?

<p/>But neither of these suppositions explained the telegraphic message, and it was the telegraphic message which had filled Robert's mind with a vague sense of alarm. The postman brought no letter from George Talboys, and the person who had knocked at the door of the chambers did not return between seven and nine o'clock, so Robert Audley left Figtree Court once more in search of his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) friend. This time he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) told the cabman to drive to the Euston Station, and in twenty minutes he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) was on the platform, making inquiries about the trains.

<p/>The Liverpool express had started half an hour before he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) reached the station, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) had to wait an hour and a quarter for a slow train to take him (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) destination.

<p/>Robert Audley chafed cruelly at this delay. Half a dozen vessels might sail for Australia while he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) roamed up and down the long platform, tumbling over trucks and porters, and swearing at his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) ill-luck.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) bought the Times newspaper, and looked instinctively at the second column, with a morbid interest in the advertisements of people missing--sons, brothers, and husbands who had left their homes, never to return or to be heard of more.

<p/>There was one advertisement of a young man found drowned somewhere on the Lambeth shore.

<p/>What if that should have been George's fate? No; the telegraphic message involved his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) father-in-law in the fact of his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) disappearance, and every speculation about him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) must start from that one point.

<p/>It was eight o'clock in the evening when Robert got into Liverpool; too late for anything except to make inquiries as to what vessel had sailed within the last two days for the antipodes.

<p/>An emigrant ship had sailed at four o'clock that afternoon--the Victoria Regia, bound for Melbourne.

<p/>The result of his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) inquiries amounted to this--If he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) wanted to find out who had sailed in the Victoria Regia, he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) must wait till the next morning, and apply for information of that vessel.

<p/>Robert Audley was at the office at nine o'clock the next morning, and was the first person after the clerks who entered it.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) met with every civility from the clerk to whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) applied. The young man referred to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) books, and running his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pen down the list of passengers who had sailed in the Victoria Regia, told Robert that there was no one among them of the name of Talboys. He (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) pushed his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) inquiries further. Had any of the passengers entered their names within a short time of the vessel's sailing?

<p/>One of the other clerks looked up from his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) desk as Robert asked this question. Yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) said; he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) remembered a young man's coming into the office at half-past three o'clock in the afternoon, and paying his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) passage money. His (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) name was the last on the list--Thomas Brown.

<p/>Robert Audley shrugged his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) shoulders. There could have been no possible reason for George's taking a feigned name. He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) asked the clerk who had last spoken if he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) could remember the appearance of this Mr. Thomas Brown.

<p/>No; the office was crowded at the time; people were running in and out, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) had not taken any particular notice of this last passenger.

<p/>Robert thanked them for their civility, and wished them good-morning. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) was leaving the office, one of the young men called after him (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>):

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, by-the-by, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I remember one thing about this Mr. Thomas Brown--his (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) arm was in a sling.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>There was nothing more for Robert Audley to do but to return to town. He (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) re-entered his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) chambers at six o'clock that evening, thoroughly worn out once more with his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) useless search.

<p/>Mrs. Maloney brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) dinner and a pint of wine from a tavern in the Strand. The evening was raw and chilly, and the laundress had lighted a good fire in the sitting-room grate.

<p/>After eating about half a mutton-chop, Robert sat with his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) wine untasted upon the table before him (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>), smoking cigars and staring into the blaze.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``George Talboys never sailed for Australia,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) said, after long and painful reflection. <div class="bookquote">``If he (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) is alive, he (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) is still in England; and if he (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) is dead, his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) body is hidden in some corner of England.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) sat for hours smoking and thinking--trouble and gloomy thoughts leaving a dark shadow upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) moody face, which neither the brilliant light of the gas nor the red blaze of the fire could dispel.

<p/>Very late in the evening he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) rose from his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) chair, pushed away the table, wheeled his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) desk over to the fire-place, took out a sheet of fools-cap, and dipped a pen in the ink.

<p/>But after doing this he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) paused, leaned his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) forehead upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) hand, and once more relapsed into thought.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall draw up a record of all that has occurred between our going down to Essex and to-night, beginning at the very beginning.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) drew up this record in short, detached sentences, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) numbered as he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) wrote.

<p/>It ran thus:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Journal of Facts connected with the Disappearance of George Talboys, inclusive of Facts which have no apparent Relation to that Circumstance.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>In spite of the troubled state of his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) mind, he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) was rather inclined to be proud of the official appearance of this heading. He (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) sat for some time looking at it with affection, and with the feather of his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) pen in his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) mouth. <div class="bookquote">``Upon my word,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I begin to think that I ought to have pursued my profession, instead of dawdling my life away as I have done.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) smoked half a cigar before he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) had got his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) thoughts in proper train, and then began to write:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``1. I write to Alicia, proposing to take George down to the Court.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``2. Alicia writes, objecting to the visit, on the part of Lady Audley.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``3. We go to Essex in spite of that objection. I see my lady. My lady refuses to be introduced to George on that particular evening on the score of fatigue.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``4. Sir Michael invites George and me to dinner for the following evening.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``5. My lady receives a telegraphic dispatch the next morning which summons her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) to London.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``6. Alicia shows me a letter from my lady, in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) requests to be told when I and my friend, Mr. Talboys, mean to leave Essex.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``7. We call at the Court, and ask to see the house. My lady's apartments are locked.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``8. We get at the aforesaid apartments by means of a secret passage, the existence of which is unknown to my lady. In one of the rooms we find her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) portrait.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``9. George is frightened at the storm. His (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) conduct is exceedingly strange for the rest of the evening.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``10. George quite himself again the following morning. I propose leaving Audley Court immediately; he (<font color='blue'><b>Court</b></font>) prefers remaining till the evening.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``11. We go out fishing. George leaves me to go to the Court.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``12.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``13. I receive information about him (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) at the station which may or may not be correct.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``14.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``15. The telegraphic message.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div><p/>When Robert Audley had completed this brief record, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) drew up with great deliberation, and with frequent pauses for reflection, alterations and erasures, he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) sat for a long time contemplating the written page.

<p/>At last he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) read it carefully over, stopping at some of the numbered paragraphs, and marking some of them with a pencil cross; then he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) folded the sheet of foolscap, went over to a cabinet on the opposite side of the room, unlocked it, and placed the paper in that very pigeon-hole into which he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) had thrust Alicia's letter--the pigeon-hole marked Important.

<p/>Having done this, he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) returned to his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) easy-chair by the fire, pushed away his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) desk, and lighted a cigar. <div class="bookquote">``It's as dark as midnight from first to last,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``and the clew to the mystery must be found either at Southampton or in Essex. Be it how it may, my mind is made up. I shall first go to Audley Court, and look for George Talboys in a narrow radius.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER XIV.

<p/>PHOEBE``S SUITOR.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. George Talboys.--Any person who has met this gentleman since the 7th inst., or who possesses any information respecting him (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) subsequent to that date, will be liberally rewarded on communicating with A.Z., 14 Chancery Lane.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Michael/Michael Audley/Audley</b></font>)</div><p/>Sir Michael Audley read the above advertisement in the second column of the Times, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) sat at breakfast with my lady and Alicia two or three days after Robert's return to town.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Robert's friend has not yet been heard of, then,''  (<font color='red'><b>the baronet</b></font>)</div>said the baronet, after reading the advertisement to his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) wife and daughter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``As for that,''  (<font color='red'><b>lady</b></font>)</div>replied my lady, <div class="bookquote">``I cannot help wondering that any one can be silly enough to advertise for him (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>). The young man was evidently of a restless, roving disposition--a sort of Bamfyld Moore Carew of modern life, whom no attraction could ever keep in one spot.''

 (<font color='red'><b>lady</b></font>)</div><p/>Though the advertisement appeared three successive times, the party at the Court attached very little importance to Mr. Talboys' disappearance; and after this one occasion his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) name was never again mentioned by either Sir Michael, my lady, or Alicia.

<p/>Alicia Audley and her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) pretty stepmother were by no means any better friends after that quiet evening on which the young barrister had dined at the Court.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) is a vain, frivolous, heartless little coquette,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alicia/Miss Audley/Miss Alicia</b></font>)</div>said Alicia, addressing herself to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) Newfoundland dog Caesar, who was the sole recipient of the young lady's confidences; <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) is a practiced and consummate flirt, Caesar; and not contented with setting her (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) yellow ringlets and her (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) silly giggle at half the men in Essex, she (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) must needs make that stupid cousin of mine dance attendance upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>). I haven't common patience with her (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div><p/>In proof of which last assertion Miss Alicia Audley treated her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) stepmother with such very palpable impertinence that Sir Michael felt himself called upon to remonstrate with his (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) only daughter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The poor little woman is very sensitive, you know, Alicia,''  (<font color='red'><b>the baronet</b></font>)</div>the baronet said, gravely, <div class="bookquote">``and she (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) feels your conduct most acutely.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the baronet</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't believe it a bit, papa,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alicia/Miss Audley/Miss Alicia</b></font>)</div>answered Alicia, stoutly. <div class="bookquote">``You think her (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) sensitive because she (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) has soft little white hands, and big blue eyes with long lashes, and all manner of affected, fantastical ways, which you stupid men call fascinating. Sensitive! Why, I've seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) do cruel things with those slender white fingers, and laugh at the pain she (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) inflicted. I'm very sorry, papa,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) added, softened a little by her (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) father's look of distress; <div class="bookquote">``though she (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) has come between us, and robbed poor Alicia of the love of that dear, generous heart, I wish I could like her (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) for your sake; but I can't, I can't, and no more can Caesar. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) came up to him (<font color='blue'><b>Caesar</b></font>) once with her (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) red lips apart, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) little white teeth glistening between them, and stroked his (<font color='blue'><b>Caesar</b></font>) great head with her (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) soft hand; but if I had not had hold of his (<font color='blue'><b>Caesar</b></font>) collar, he (<font color='blue'><b>Caesar</b></font>) would have flown at her (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) throat and strangled her (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) may bewitch every man in Essex, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>)'d never make friends with my dog.''

 (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Your dog shall be shot,''  (<font color='red'><b>Michael/Michael Audley/Audley</b></font>)</div>answered Sir Michael angrily, <div class="bookquote">``if his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) vicious temper ever endangers Lucy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Michael/Michael Audley/Audley</b></font>)</div><p/>The Newfoundland rolled his (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) eyes slowly round in the direction of the speaker, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) understood every word that had been said. Lady Audley happened to enter the room at this very moment, and the animal cowered down by the side of his (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) mistress with a suppressed growl. There was something in the manner of the dog which was, if anything, more indicative of terror than of fury; incredible as it appears that Caesar should be frightened by so fragile a creature as Lucy Audley.

<p/>Amicable as was my lady's nature, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) could not live long at the Court without discovering Alicia's dislike to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) never alluded to it but once; then, shrugging her (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) graceful white shoulders, she (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) said, with a sigh:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It seems very hard that you cannot love me, Alicia, for I have never been used to make enemies; but since it seems that it must be so, I cannot help it. If we cannot be friends, let us be neutral. You won't try to injure me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Injure you!''  (<font color='red'><b>Alicia/Miss Audley/Miss Alicia</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Alicia; <div class="bookquote">``how should I injure you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Alicia/Miss Audley/Miss Alicia</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You'll not try to deprive me of your father's affection?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I may not be as amiable as you are, my lady, and I may not have the same sweet smiles and pretty words for every stranger I meet, but I am not capable of a contemptible meanness; and even if I were, I think you are so secure of my father's love, that nothing but your own act will ever deprive you of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What a severe creature you are, Alicia!''  (<font color='red'><b>lady</b></font>)</div>said my lady, making a little grimace. <div class="bookquote">``I suppose you mean to infer by all that, that I'm deceitful. Why, I can't help smiling at people, and speaking prettily to them. I know I'm no better than the rest of the world; but I can't help it if I'm pleasantér. It's constitutional.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Alicia/Miss Audley/Miss Alicia</b></font>)</div><p/>Alicia having thus entirely shut the door upon all intimacy between Lady Audley and herself, and Sir Michael being chiefly occupied in agricultural pursuits and manly sports, which kept him (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) away from home, it was perhaps natural that my lady, being of an eminently social disposition, should find herself thrown a good deal upon her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) white-eyelashed maid for society.

<p/>Phoebe Marks was exactly the sort of a girl who is generally promoted from the post of lady's maid to that of companion. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had just sufficient education to enable her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) to understand her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) mistress when Lucy chose to allow herself to run riot in a species of intellectual tarantella, in which her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) tongue went mad to the sound of its own rattle, as the Spanish dancer at the noise of his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) castanets. Phoebe knew enough of the French language to be able to dip into the yellow-paper-covered novels which my lady ordered from the Burlington Arcade, and to discourse with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) mistress upon the questionable subjects of these romances. The likeness which the lady's maid bore to Lucy Audley was, perhaps, a point of sympathy between the two women. It was not to be called a striking likeness; a stranger might have seen them both together, and yet have failed to remark it. But there were certain dim and shadowy lights in which, meeting Phoebe Marks gliding softly through the dark oak passages of the Court, or under the shrouded avenues in the garden, you might have easily mistaken her (<font color='blue'><b>Marks</b></font>) for my lady.

<p/>Sharp October winds were sweeping the leaves from the limes in the long avenue, and driving them in withered heaps with a ghostly rustling noise along the dry gravel walks. The old well must have been half choked up with the leaves that drifted about it, and whirled in eddying circles into its black, broken mouth. On the still bosom of the fish-pond the same withered leaves slowly rotted away, mixing themselves with the tangled weeds that discolored the surface of the water. All the gardeners Sir Michael could employ could not keep the impress of autumn's destroying hand from the grounds about the Court.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How I hate this desolate month!''  (<font color='red'><b>lady</b></font>)</div>my lady said, as she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) walked about the garden, shivering beneath her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) sable mantle. <div class="bookquote">``Every thing dropping to ruin and decay, and the cold flicker of the sun lighting up the ugliness of the earth, as the glare of gas-lamps lights the wrinkles of an old woman. Shall I ever grow old, Phoebe? Will my hair ever drop off as the leaves are falling from those trees, and leave me wan and bare like them? What is to become of me when I grow old?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) shivered at the thought of this more than she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had done at the cold, wintry breeze, and muffling herself closely in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) fur, walked so fast that her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) maid had some difficulty in keeping up with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you remember, Phoebe,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said, presently, relaxing her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) pace, <div class="bookquote">``do you remember that French story we read--the story of a beautiful woman who had committed some crime--I forget what--in the zenith of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) power and loveliness, when all Paris drank to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) every night, and when the people ran away from the carriage of the king to flock about hers, and get a peep at her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) face? Do you remember how she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) kept the secret of what she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had done for nearly half a century, spending her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) old age in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) family chateau, beloved and honored by all the province as an uncanonized saint and benefactress to the poor; and how, when her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hair was white, and her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) eyes almost blind with age, the secret was revealed through one of those strange accidents by which such secrets always are revealed in romances, and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was tried, found guilty, and condemned to be burned alive? The king who had worn her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) colors was dead and gone; the court of which she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had been a star had passed away; powerful functionaries and great magistrates, who might perhaps have helped her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), were moldering in the graves; brave young cavaliers, who would have died for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), had fallen upon distant battle-fields; she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had lived to see the age to which she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had belonged fade like a dream; and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) went to the stake, followed by only a few ignorant country people, who forgot all her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) bounties, and hooted at her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) for a wicked sorceress.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't care for such dismal stories, my lady,''  (<font color='red'><b>Phoebe/Phoebe Marks/PHOEBE</b></font>)</div>said Phoebe Marks with a shudder. <div class="bookquote">``One has no need to read books to give one the horrors in this dull place.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Audley/LADY AUDLEY</b></font>)</div><p/>Lady Audley shrugged her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) shoulders and laughed at her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) maid's candor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is a dull place, Phoebe,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``though it doesn't do to say so to my dear old husband. Though I am the wife of one of the most influential men in the county, I don't know that I wasn't nearly as well off at Mr. Dawson's; and yet it's something to wear sables that cost sixty guineas, and have a thousand pounds spent on the decoration of one's apartments.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Treated as a companion by her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) mistress, in the receipt of the most liberal wages, and with perquisites such as perhaps lady's maid never had before, it was strange that Phoebe Marks should wish to leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Marks</b></font>) situation; but it was not the less a fact that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marks</b></font>) was anxious to exchange all the advantages of Audley Court for the very unpromising prospect which awaited her (<font color='blue'><b>Marks</b></font>) as the wife of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marks</b></font>) Cousin Luke.

<p/>The young man had contrived in some manner to associate himself with the improved fortunes of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sweetheart. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had never allowed Phoebe any peace till she (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) had obtained for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), by the aid of my lady's interference, a situation as undergroom of the Court.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) never rode out with either Alicia or Sir Michael; but on one of the few occasions upon which my lady mounted the pretty little gray thoroughbred reserved for her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) use, he (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) contrived to attend her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) ride. He (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) saw enough, in the very first half hour they were out, to discover that, graceful as Lucy Audley might look in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) long blue cloth habit, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was a timid horsewoman, and utterly unable to manage the animal she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) rode.

<p/>Lady Audley remonstrated with her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) maid upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) folly in wishing to marry the uncouth groom.

<p/>The two women were seated together over the fire in my lady's dressing-room, the gray sky closing in upon the October afternoon, and the black tracery of ivy darkening the casement windows.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You surely are not in love with the awkward, ugly creature are you, Phoebe?''  (<font color='red'><b>lady</b></font>)</div>asked my lady sharply.

<p/>The girl was sitting on a low stool at her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) mistress feet. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) did not answer my lady's question immediately, but sat for some time looking vacantly into the red abyss in the hollow fire.

<p/>Presently she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said, rather as if she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had been thinking aloud than answering Lucy's question:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think I can love him (<font color='blue'><b>Dawson</b></font>). We have been together from children, and I promised, when I was little better than fifteen, that I'd be his (<font color='blue'><b>Dawson</b></font>) wife. I daren't break that promise now. There have been times when I've made up the very sentence I meant to say to him (<font color='blue'><b>Dawson</b></font>), telling him (<font color='blue'><b>Dawson</b></font>) that I couldn't keep my faith with him (<font color='blue'><b>Dawson</b></font>); but the words have died upon my lips, and I've sat looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Dawson</b></font>), with a choking sensation, in my throat that wouldn't let me speak. I daren't refuse to marry him (<font color='blue'><b>Dawson</b></font>). I've often watched and watched him (<font color='blue'><b>Dawson</b></font>), as he (<font color='blue'><b>Dawson</b></font>) has sat slicing away at a hedge-stake with his (<font color='blue'><b>Dawson</b></font>) great clasp-knife, till I have thought that it is just such men as he (<font color='blue'><b>Dawson</b></font>) who have decoyed their sweethearts into lonely places, and murdered them for being false to their word. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Dawson</b></font>) was a boy he (<font color='blue'><b>Dawson</b></font>) was always violent and revengeful. I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Dawson</b></font>) once take up that very knife in a quarrel with his (<font color='blue'><b>Dawson</b></font>) mother. I tell you, my lady, I must marry him (<font color='blue'><b>Dawson</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Graham/Lucy Graham</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You silly girl, you shall do nothing of the kind!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Graham/Lucy Graham</b></font>)</div>answered Lucy. <div class="bookquote">``You think he (<font color='blue'><b>Dawson</b></font>)'ll murder you, do you? Do you think, then, if murder is in him (<font color='blue'><b>Dawson</b></font>), you would be any safer as his (<font color='blue'><b>Dawson</b></font>) wife? If you thwarted him (<font color='blue'><b>Dawson</b></font>), or made him (<font color='blue'><b>Dawson</b></font>) jealous; if he (<font color='blue'><b>Dawson</b></font>) wanted to marry another woman, or to get hold of some poor, pitiful bit of money of yours, couldn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Dawson</b></font>) murder you then? I tell you you sha'n't marry him (<font color='blue'><b>Dawson</b></font>), Phoebe. In the first place I hate the man; and, in the next place I can't afford to part with you. We'll give him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) a few pounds and send him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) about his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) business.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Phoebe/Phoebe Marks/PHOEBE</b></font>)</div><p/>Phoebe Marks caught my lady's hand in hers, and clasped them convulsively.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My lady--my good, kind mistress!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Marks</b></font>) cried, vehemently, <div class="bookquote">``don't try to thwart me in this--don't ask me to thwart him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). I tell you I must marry him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). You don't know what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is. It will be my ruin, and the ruin of others, if I break my word.

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well, then, Phoebe,''  (<font color='red'><b>mistress</b></font>)</div>answered her (<font color='blue'><b>Marks</b></font>) mistress, <div class="bookquote">``I can't oppose you.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are very good, my lady,''  (<font color='red'><b>Phoebe/Phoebe Marks/PHOEBE</b></font>)</div>Phoebe answered with a sigh.

<p/>Lady Audley sat in the glow of firelight and wax candles in the luxurious drawing-room; the amber damask cushions of the sofa contrasting with her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) dark violet velvet dress, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) rippling hair falling about her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) neck in a golden haze. Everywhere around her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) were the evidences of wealth and splendor; while in strange contrast to all this, and to her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) own beauty; the awkward groom stood rubbing his (<font color='blue'><b>groom</b></font>) bullet head as my lady explained to him (<font color='blue'><b>groom</b></font>) what she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) intended to do for her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) confidential maid. Lucy's promises were very liberal, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) had expected that, uncouth as the man was, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would, in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own rough manner, have expressed his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) gratitude.

<p/>To her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) surprise he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stood staring at the floor without uttering a word in answer to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) offer. Phoebe was standing close to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) elbow, and seemed distressed at the man's rudeness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell my lady how thankful you are, Luke,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But I'm not so over and above thankful,''  (<font color='red'><b>lover</b></font>)</div>answered her (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) lover, savagely. <div class="bookquote">``Fifty pound ain't much to start a public. You'll make it a hundred, my lady?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall do nothing of the kind,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Audley/LADY AUDLEY</b></font>)</div>said Lady Audley, her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) clear blue eyes flashing with indignation, <div class="bookquote">``and I wonder at your impertinence in asking it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Audley/LADY AUDLEY</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes, you will, though,''  (<font color='red'><b>Luke/Luke Marks/Mr. Marks</b></font>)</div>answered Luke, with quiet insolence that had a hidden meaning. <div class="bookquote">``You'll make it a hundred, my lady.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Audley/LADY AUDLEY</b></font>)</div><p/>Lady Audley rose from her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) seat, looked the man steadfastly in the face till his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) determined gaze sunk under hers; then walking straight up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) maid, she (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) said in a high, piercing voice, peculiar to her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) in moments of intense agitation:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Phoebe Marks, you have told this man!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>The girl fell on her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) knees at my lady's feet.

 (<font color='red'><b>CHAPTER XV</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER XV.

<p/>ON THE WATCH.

<p/>Upon a lowering morning late in November, with the yellow fog low upon the flat meadows, and the blinded cattle groping their way through the dim obscurity, and blundering stupidly against black and leafless hedges, or stumbling into ditches, undistinguishable in the hazy atmosphere; with the village church looming brown and dingy through the uncertain light; with every winding path and cottage door, every gable end and gray old chimney, every village child and straggling cur seeming strange and weird of aspect in the semi-darkness, Phoebe Marks and her (<font color='blue'><b>Marks</b></font>) Cousin Luke made their way through the churchyard of Audley, and presented themselves before a shivering curate, whose surplice hung in damp folds, soddened by the morning mist, and whose temper was not improved by his (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) having waited five minutes for the bride and bridegroom.

<p/>Luke Marks, dressed in his (<font color='blue'><b>Marks</b></font>) ill-fitting Sunday clothes, looked by no means handsomer than in his (<font color='blue'><b>Marks</b></font>) every-day apparel; but Phoebe, arrayed in a rustling silk of delicate gray, that had been worn about half a dozen times by her (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) mistress, looked, as the few spectators of the ceremony remarked, <div class="bookquote">``quite the lady.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the spectators</b></font>)</div><p/>A very dim and shadowy lady, vague of outline, and faint of coloring, with eyes, hair, complexion and dress all melting into such pale and uncertain shades that, in the obscure light of the foggy November morning a superstitious stranger might have mistaken the bride for the ghost of some other bride, dead and buried in the vault below the church.

<p/>Mr. Luke Marks, the hero of the occasion, thought very little of all this. He (<font color='blue'><b>Marks</b></font>) had secured the wife of his (<font color='blue'><b>Marks</b></font>) choice, and the object of his (<font color='blue'><b>Marks</b></font>) life-long ambition--a public house. My lady had provided the seventy-five pounds necessary for the purchase of the good-will and fixtures, with the stock of ales and spirits, of a small inn in the center of a lonely little village, perched on the summit of a hill, and called Mount Stanning. It was not a very pretty house to look at; it had something of a tumble-down, weather-beaten appearance, standing, as it did, upon high ground, sheltered only by four or five bare and overgrown poplars, that had shot up too rapidly for their strength, and had a blighted, forlorn look in consequence. The wind had had its own way with the Castle Inn, and had sometimes made cruel use of its power. It was the wind that battered and bent the low, thatched roofs of outhouses and stables, till they hung over and lurched forward, as a slouched hat hangs over the low forehead of some village ruffian; it was the wind that shook and rattled the wooden shutters before the narrow casements, till they hung broken and dilapidated upon their rusty hinges; it was the wind that overthrew the pigeon house, and broke the vane that had been imprudently set up to tell the movements of its mightiness; it was the wind that made light of any little bit of wooden trellis-work, or creeping plant, or tiny balcony, or any modest decoration whatsoever, and tore and scattered it in its scornful fury; it was the wind that left mossy secretions on the discolored surface of the plaster walls; it was the wind, in short, that shattered, and ruined, and rent, and trampled upon the tottering pile of buildings, and then flew shrieking off, to riot and glory in its destroying strength. The dispirited proprietor grew tired of his (<font color='blue'><b>proprietor</b></font>) long struggle with this mighty enemy; so the wind was left to work its own will, and the Castle Inn fell slowly to decay. But for all that it suffered without, it was not the less prosperous within doors. Sturdy drovers stopped to drink at the little bar; well-to-do farmers spent their evenings and talked politics in the low, wainscoted parlor, while their horses munched some suspicious mixture of moldy hay and tolerable beans in the tumble-down stables. Sometimes even the members of the Audley hunt stopped to drink and bait their horses at the Castle Inn; while, on one grand and never-to-be-forgotten occasion, a dinner had been ordered by the master of the hounds for some thirty gentlemen, and the proprietor driven nearly mad by the importance of the demand.

<p/>So Luke Marks, who was by no means troubled with an eye for the beautiful, thought himself very fortunate in becoming the landlord of the Castle Inn, Mount Stanning.

<p/>A chaise-cart was waiting in the fog to convey the bride and bridegroom to their new home; and a few of the villagers, who had known Phoebe from a child, were lingering around the churchyard gate to bid her (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) good-by. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) pale eyes were still paler from the tears she (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) had shed, and the red rims which surrounded them. The bridegroom was annoyed at this exhibition of emotion.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What are you blubbering for, lass?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>bridegroom</b></font>) said, fiercely. <div class="bookquote">``If you didn't want to marry me you should have told me so. I ain't going to murder you, am I?''

 (<font color='red'><b>The lady</b></font>)</div><p/>The lady's maid shivered as he (<font color='blue'><b>bridegroom</b></font>) spoke to her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>), and dragged her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) little silk mantle closely around her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You're cold in all this here finery,''  (<font color='red'><b>Luke/Luke Marks/Mr. Marks</b></font>)</div>said Luke, staring at her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) costly dress with no expression of good-will. <div class="bookquote">``Why can't women dress according to their station? You won't have no silk gownds out of my pocket, I can tell you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) lifted the shivering girl into the chaise, wrapped a rough great-coat about her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>), and drove off through the yellow fog, followed by a feeble cheer from two or three urchins clustered around the gate.

<p/>A new maid was brought from London to replace Phoebe Marks about the person of my lady--a very showy damsel, who wore a black satin gown, and rose-colored ribbons in her (<font color='blue'><b>damsel</b></font>) cap, and complained bitterly of the dullness of Audley Court.

<p/>But Christmas brought visitors to the rambling old mansion. A country squire and his (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) fat wife occupied the tapestried chamber; merry girls scampered up and down the long passages, and young men stared out of the latticed windows, watching for southerly winds and cloudy skies; there was not an empty stall in the roomy old stables; an extempore forge had been set up in the yard for the shoeing of hunters; yelping dogs made the place noisy with their perpetual clamor; strange servants herded together on the garret story; and every little casement hidden away under some pointed gable, and every dormer window in the quaint old roof, glimmered upon the winter's night with its separate taper, till, coming suddenly upon Audley Court, the benighted stranger, misled by the light, and noise, and bustle of the place, might have easily fallen into young Marlowe's error, and have mistaken the hospitable mansion for a good, old-fashioned inn, such as have faded from this earth since the last mail coach and prancing tits took their last melancholy journey to the knacker's yard.

<p/>Among other visitors Mr. Robert Audley came down to Essex for the hunting season, with half a dozen French novels, a case of cigars, and three pounds of Turkish tobacco in his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) portmanteau.

<p/>The honest young country squires, who talked all breakfast time of Flying Dutchman fillies and Voltigeur colts; of glorious runs of seven hours' hard riding over three counties, and a midnight homeward ride of thirty miles upon their covert hacks; and who ran away from the well-spread table with their mouths full of cold sirloin, to look at that off pastern, or that sprained forearm, or the colt that had just come back from the veterinary surgeon's, set down Robert Audley, dawdling over a slice of bread and marmalade, as a person utterly unworthy of any remark whatsoever.

<p/>The young barrister had brought a couple of dogs with him (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>); and the country gentleman who gave fifty pounds for a pointer; and traveled a couple of hundred miles to look at a leash of setters before he (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) struck a bargain, laughed aloud at the two miserable curs, one of which had followed Robert Audley through Chancery Lane, and half the length of Holborn; while his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) companion had been taken by the barrister vi et armis from a coster-monger who was ill-using him (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>). And as Robert furthermore insisted on having these two deplorable animals under his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) easy-chair in the drawing-room, much to the annoyance of my lady, who, as we know, hated all dogs, the visitors at Audley Court looked upon the baronet's nephew as an inoffensive species of maniac.

<p/>During other visits to the Court Robert Audley had made a feeble show of joining in the sports of the merry assembly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) had jogged across half a dozen ploughed fields on a quiet gray pony of Sir Michael's, and drawing up breathless and panting at the door of some farm-house, had expressed his (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) intention of following the hounds no further that morning. He (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) had even gone so far as to put on, with great labor, a pair of skates, with a view to taking a turn on the frozen surface of the fishpond, and had fallen ignominously at the first attempt, lying placidly extended on the flat of his (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) back until such time as the bystanders should think fit to pick him (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) up. He (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) had occupied the back seat in a dog-cart during a pleasant morning drive, vehemently protesting against being taken up hill, and requiring the vehicle to be stopped every ten minutes in order to readjust the cushions. But this year he (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) showed no inclination for any of these outdoor amusements, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) spent his (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) time entirely in lounging in the drawing-room, and making himself agreeable, after his (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) own lazy fashion, to my lady and Alicia.

<p/>Lady Audley received her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) nephew's attentions in that graceful half-childish fashion which her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) admirers found so charming; but Alicia was indignant at the change in her (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) cousin's conduct.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You were always a poor, spiritless fellow, Bob,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>said the young lady, contemptuously, as she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) bounced into the drawing-room in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) riding-habit, after a hunting breakfast, from which Robert had absented himself, preferring a cup of tea in my lady's boudoir; <div class="bookquote">``but this year I don't know what has come to you. You are good for nothing but to hold a skein of silk or read Tennyson to Lady Audley.''

 (<font color='red'><b>lady</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear, hasty, impetuous Alicia, don't be violent,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the young man imploringly. <div class="bookquote">``A conclusion isn't a five-barred gate; and you needn't give your judgment its head, as you give your mare Atalanta hers, when you're flying across country at the heels of an unfortunate fox. Lady Audley interests me, and my uncle's county friends do not. Is that a sufficient answer, Alicia?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Alicia/Miss Audley/Miss Alicia</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Audley gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) head a little scornful toss.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's as good an answer as I shall ever get from, you, Bob,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) said, impatiently; <div class="bookquote">``but pray amuse yourself in your own way; loll in an easy-chair all day, with those two absurd dogs asleep on your knees; spoil my lady's window-curtains with your cigars and annoy everybody in the house with your stupid, inanimate countenance.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Robert Audley opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) handsome gray eyes to their widest extent at this tirade, and looked helplessly at Miss Alicia.

<p/>The young lady was walking up and down the room, slashing the skirt of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) habit with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) riding-whip. Her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) eyes sparkled with an angry flash, and a crimson glow burned under her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) clear brown skin. The young barrister knew very well, by these diagnostics, that his (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) cousin was in a passion.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) repeated, <div class="bookquote">``your stupid, inanimate countenance. Do you know, Robert Audley, that with all your mock amiability, you are brimful of conceit and superciliousness. You look down upon our amusements; you lift up your eyebrows, and shrug your shoulders, and throw yourself back in your chair, and wash your hands of us and our pleasures. You are a selfish, cold-hearted Sybarite--''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Alicia! Good--gracious--me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The morning paper dropped out of his (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) hands, and he (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) sat feebly staring at his (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) assailant.

<p/>``Yes, selfish, Robert Audley! You take home half-starved dogs, because you like half-starved dogs. You stoop down, and pat the head of every good-for-nothing cur in the village street, because you like good-for-nothing curs. You notice little children, and give them halfpence, because it amuses you to do so. But you lift your eyebrows a quarter of a yard when poor Sir Harry Towers tells a stupid story, and stare the poor fellow out of countenance with your lazy insolence. As to your amiability, you would let a man hit you, and say <div class="bookquote">``Thank you' for the blow, rather than take the trouble to hit him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) again; but you wouldn't go half a mile out of your way to serve your dearest friend. Sir Harry is worth twenty of you, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) did write to ask if my m-a-i-r Atalanta had recovered from the sprain. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) can't spell, or lift his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) eyebrows to the roots of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hair; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) would go through fire and water for the girl he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) loves; while you--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div><p/>At this very point, when Robert was most prepared to encounter his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) cousin's violence, and when Miss Alicia seemed about to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) strongest attack, the young lady broke down altogether, and burst into tears.

<p/>Robert sprang from his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) easy-chair, upsetting his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) dogs on the carpet.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Alicia, my darling, what is it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's--it's--it's the feather of my hat that got into my eyes,''  (<font color='red'><b>cousin</b></font>)</div>sobbed his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) cousin; and before he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) could investigate the truth of this assertion Alicia had darted out of the room.

<p/>Robert Audley was preparing to follow her (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>), when he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) voice in the court-yard below, amidst the tramping of horses and the clamor of visitors, dogs, and grooms. Sir Harry Towers, the most aristocratic young sportsman in the neighborhood, had just taken her (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) little foot in his (<font color='blue'><b>Towers</b></font>) hand as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) sprung into her (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) saddle.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good Heaven!''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Robert, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) watched the merry party of equestrians until they disappeared under the archway. <div class="bookquote">``What does all this mean? How charmingly she (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) sits her (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) horse! What a pretty figure, too, and a fine, candid, brown, rosy face: but to fly at a fellow like that, without the least provocation! That's the consequence of letting a girl follow the hounds. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) learns to look at everything in life as she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) does at six feet of timber or a sunk fence; she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) goes through the world as she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) goes across country--straight ahead, and over everything. Such a nice girl as she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) might have been, too, if she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)'d been brought up in Figtree Court! If ever I marry, and have daughters -LRB-which remote contingency may Heaven forefend!-RRB- they shall be educated in Paper Buildings, take their sole exercise in the Temple Gardens, and they shall never go beyond the gates till they are marriageable, when I will walk them straight across Fleet street to St. Dunstan's church, and deliver them into the hands of their husbands.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div><p/>With such reflections as these did Mr. Robert Audley beguile the time until my lady re-entered the drawing-room, fresh and radiant in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) elegant morning costume, her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) yellow curls glistening with the perfumed waters in which she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had bathed, and her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) velvet-covered sketch-book in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) arms. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) planted a little easel upon a table by the window, seated herself before it, and began to mix the colors upon her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) palette, Robert watching her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) half-closed eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are sure my cigar does not annoy you, Lady Audley?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, no indeed; I am quite used to the smell of tobacco. Mr. Dawson, the surgeon, smoked all the evening when I lived in his (<font color='blue'><b>Dawson</b></font>) house.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dawson is a good fellow, isn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Dawson</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>Robert asked, carelessly.

<p/>My lady burst into her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) pretty, gushing laugh.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The dearest of good creatures,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Dawson</b></font>) paid me five-and-twenty pounds a year--only fancy, five-and-twenty pounds! That made six pounds five a quarter. How well I remember receiving the money--six dingy old sovereigns, and a little heap of untidy, dirty silver, that came straight from the till in the surgery! And then how glad I was to get it! While now--I can't help laughing while I think of it--these colors I am using cost a guinea each at Winsor & Newton's--the carmine and ultramarine thirty shillings. I gave Mrs. Dawson one of my silk dresses the other day, and the poor thing kissed me, and the surgeon carried the bundle home under his (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) cloak.''

 (<font color='red'><b>lady</b></font>)</div><p/>My lady laughed long and joyously at the thought. Her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) colors were mixed; she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was copying a water-colored sketch of an impossibly Turneresque atmosphere. The sketch was nearly finished, and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had only to put in some critical little touches with the most delicate of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) sable pencils. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) prepared herself daintily for the work, looking sideways at the painting.

<p/>All this time Mr. Robert Audley's eyes were fixed intently on her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) pretty face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is a change,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) said, after so long a pause that my lady might have forgotten what she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had been talking of, <div class="bookquote">``it is a change! Some women would do a great deal to accomplish such a change as that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Lady Audley's clear blue eyes dilated as she (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) fixed them suddenly on the young barrister. The wintry sunlight, gleaming full upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) face from a side window, lit up the azure of those beautiful eyes, till their color seemed to flicker and tremble betwixt blue and green, as the opal tints of the sea change upon a summer's day. The small brush fell from her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) hand, and blotted out the peasant's face under a widening circle of crimson lake.

<p/>Robert Audley was tenderly coaxing the crumbled leaf of his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) cigar with cautious fingers.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My friend at the corner of Chancery Lane has not given me such good Manillas as usual,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) murmured. <div class="bookquote">``If ever you smoke, my dear aunt -LRB-and I am told that many women take a quiet weed under the rose-RRB-, be very careful how you choose your cigars.''

 (<font color='red'><b>lady</b></font>)</div><p/>My lady drew a long breath, picked up her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) brush, and laughed aloud at Robert's advice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What an eccentric creature you are, Mr. Audley I Do you know that you sometimes puzzle me--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not more than you puzzle me, dear aunt.''

 (<font color='red'><b>lady</b></font>)</div><p/>My lady put away her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) colors and sketch book, and seating herself in the deep recess of another window, at a considerable distance from Robert Audley, settled to a large piece of Berlin-wool work--a piece of embroidery which the Penelopes of ten or twelve years ago were very fond of exercising their ingenuity upon--the Olden Time at Bolton Abbey.

<p/>Seated in the embrasure of this window, my lady was separated from Robert Audley by the whole length of the room, and the young man could only catch an occasional glimpse of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) fair face, surrounded by its bright aureole of hazy, golden hair.

<p/>Robert Audley had been a week at the Court, but as yet neither he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) nor my lady had mentioned the name of George Talboys.

<p/>This morning, however, after exhausting the usual topics of conversation, Lady Audley made an inquiry about her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) nephew's friend; <div class="bookquote">``That Mr. George--George--''  (<font color='red'><b>nephew friend</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) said, hesitating.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Talboys,''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>suggested Robert.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, to be sure--Mr. George Talboys. Rather a singular name, by-the-by, and certainly, by all accounts, a very singular person. Have you seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) lately?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have not seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) since the 7th of September last--the day upon which he (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) left me asleep in the meadows on the other side of the village.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear me!''  (<font color='red'><b>lady man</b></font>)</div>exclaimed my lady, <div class="bookquote">``what a very strange young man this Mr. George Talboys must be! Pray tell me all about it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>lady man</b></font>)</div><p/>Robert told, in a few words, of his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) visit to Southampton and his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) journey to Liverpool, with their different results, my lady listening very attentively.

<p/>In order to tell this story to better advantage, the young man left his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) chair, and, crossing the room, took up his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) place opposite to Lady Audley, in the embrasure of the window.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And what do you infer from all this?''  (<font color='red'><b>lady</b></font>)</div>asked my lady, after a pause.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is so great a mystery to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) answered, <div class="bookquote">``that I scarcely dare to draw any conclusion whatever; but in the obscurity I think I can grope my way to two suppositions, which to me seem almost certainties.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And they are--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``First, that George Talboys never went beyond Southampton. Second, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) never went to Southampton at all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you traced him (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) there. His (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) father-in-law had seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have reason to doubt his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) father-in-law's integrity.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good gracious me!''  (<font color='red'><b>lady</b></font>)</div>cried my lady, piteously. <div class="bookquote">``What do you mean by all this?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Lady Audley,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>answered the young man, gravely, <div class="bookquote">``I have never practiced as a barrister. I have enrolled myself in the ranks of a profession, the members of which hold solemn responsibilities and have sacred duties to perform; and I have shrunk from those responsibilities and duties, as I have from all the fatigues of this troublesome life. But we are sometimes forced into the very position we have most avoided, and I have found myself lately compelled to think of these things. Lady Audley, did you ever study the theory of circumstantial evidence?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How can you ask a poor little woman about such horrid things?''  (<font color='red'><b>lady</b></font>)</div>exclaimed my lady.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Circumstantial evidence,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>continued the young man, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) scarcely heard Lady Audley's interruption--<div class="bookquote">``that wonderful fabric which is built out of straws collected at every point of the compass, and which is yet strong enough to hang a man. Upon what infinitesimal trifles may sometimes hang the whole secret of some wicked mystery, inexplicable heretofore to the wisest upon the earth! A scrap of paper, a shred of some torn garment, the button off a coat, a word dropped incautiously from the overcautious lips of guilt, the fragment of a letter, the shutting or opening of a door, a shadow on a window-blind, the accuracy of a moment tested by one of Benson's watches--a thousand circumstances so slight as to be forgotten by the criminal, but links of iron in the wonderful chain forged by the science of the detective officer; and lo! the gallows is built up; the solemn bell tolls through the dismal gray of the early morning, the drop creaks under the guilty feet, and the penalty of crime is paid.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Audley/LADY AUDLEY</b></font>)</div><p/>Faint shadows of green and crimson fell upon my lady's face from the painted escutcheons in the mullioned window by which she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) sat; but every trace of the natural color of that face had faded out, leaving it a ghastly ashen gray.

<p/>Sitting quietly in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) chair, her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) head fallen back upon the amber damask cushions, and her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) little hands lying powerless in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) lap, Lady Audley had fainted away.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The radius grows narrower day by day,''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>said Robert Audley. <div class="bookquote">``George Talboys never reached Southampton.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER XVI.

<p/>ROBERT AUDLEY GETS HIS (<font color='blue'><b>AUDLEY</b></font>) CONGE.

<p/>The Christmas week was over, and one by one the country visitors dropped away from Audley Court. The fat squire and his (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) wife abandoned the gray, tapestried chamber, and left the black-browed warriors looming from the wall to scowl upon and threaten new guests, or to glare vengefully upon vacancy. The merry girls on the second story packed, or caused to be packed, their trunks and imperials, and tumbled gauze ball-dresses were taken home that had been brought fresh to Audley. Blundering old family chariots, with horses whose untrimmed fetlocks told of rougher work than even country roads, were brought round to the broad space before the grim oak door, and laden with chaotic heaps of womanly luggage. Pretty rosy faces peeped out of carriage windows to smile the last farewell upon the group at the hall door, as the vehicle rattled and rumbled under the ivied archway. Sir Michael was in request everywhere. Shaking hands with the young sportsmen; kissing the rosy-cheeked girls; sometimes even embracing portly matrons who came to thank him (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) for their pleasant visit; everywhere genial, hospitable, generous, happy, and beloved, the baronet hurried from room to room, from the hall to the stables, from the stables to the court-yard, from the court-yard to the arched gateway to speed the parting guest.

<p/>My lady's yellow curls flashed hither and thither like wandering gleams of sunshine on these busy days of farewell. Her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) great blue eyes had a pretty, mournful look, in charming unison with the soft pressure of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) little hand, and that friendly, though perhaps rather stereotyped speech, in which she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) told her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) visitors how she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was so sorry to lose them, and how she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) didn't know what she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) should do till they came once more to enliven the court by their charming society.

<p/>But however sorry my lady might be to lose her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) visitors, there was at least one guest whose society she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was not deprived of. Robert Audley showed no intention of leaving his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) uncle's house. He (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) had no professional duties, he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) said; Figtree Court was delightfully shady in hot weather, but there was a sharp corner round which the wind came in the summer months, armed with avenging rheumatisms and influenzas. Everybody was so good to him (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) at the Court, that really he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) had no inclination to hurry away.

<p/>Sir Michael had but one answer to this: <div class="bookquote">``Stay, my dear boy; stay, my dear Bob, as long as ever you like. I have no son, and you stand to me in the place of one. Make yourself agreeable to Lucy, and make the Court your home as long as you live.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Michael/Michael Audley/Audley</b></font>)</div><p/>To which Robert would merely reply by grasping his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) uncle's hand vehemently, and muttering something about <div class="bookquote">``a jolly old prince.''

 (<font color='red'><b>uncle</b></font>)</div><p/>It was to be observed that there was sometimes a certain vague sadness in the young man's tone when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) called Sir Michael <div class="bookquote">``a jolly old prince;''  (<font color='red'><b>Michael/Michael Audley/Audley</b></font>)</div>some shadow of affectionate regret that brought a mist into Robert's eyes, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) sat in a corner of the room looking thoughtfully at the white-bearded baronet.

<p/>Before the last of the young sportsmen departed, Sir Harry Towers demanded and obtained an interview with Miss Alicia Audley in the oak library--an interview in which considerable emotion was displayed by the stalwart young fox-hunter; so much emotion, indeed, and of such a genuine and honest character, that Alicia fairly broke down as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) told him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) should forever esteem and respect him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) for his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) true and noble heart, but that he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) must never, never, unless he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) wished to cause her (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) the most cruel distress, ask more from her (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) than this esteem and respect.

<p/>Sir Harry left the library by the French window opening into the pond-garden. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) strolled into that very lime-walk which George Talboys had compared to an avenue in a churchyard, and under the leafless trees fought the battle of his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) brave young heart.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What a fool I am to feel it like this!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) cried, stamping his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) foot upon the frosty ground. <div class="bookquote">``I always knew it would be so; I always knew that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) was a hundred times too good for me. God bless her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)! How nobly and tenderly she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) spoke; how beautiful she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) looked with the crimson blushes under her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) brown skin, and the tears in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) big, gray eyes--almost as handsome as the day she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) took the sunk fence, and let me put the brush in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) hat as we rode home! God bless her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)! I can get over anything as long as she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) doesn't care for that sneaking lawyer. But I couldn't stand that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>That lawyer</b></font>)</div><p/>That sneaking lawyer, by which appellation Sir Harry alluded to Mr. Robert Audley, was standing in the hall, looking at a map of the midland counties, when Alicia came out of the library, with red eyes, after her (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) interview with the fox-hunting baronet.

<p/>Robert, who was short-sighted, had his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) eyes within half an inch of the surface of the map as the young lady approached him (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Norwich is in Norfolk, and that fool, young Vincent, said it was in Herefordshire. Ha, Alicia, is that you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) turned round so as to intercept Miss Audley on her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) way to the staircase.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>cousin</b></font>)</div>replied his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) cousin curtly, trying to pass him (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Alicia, you have been crying.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The lady</b></font>)</div><p/>The young lady did not condescend to reply.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You have been crying, Alicia. Sir Harry Towers, of Towers Park, in the county of Herts, has been making you an offer of his (<font color='blue'><b>Towers</b></font>) hand, eh?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you been listening at the door, Mr. Audley?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have not, Miss Audley. On principle, I object to listen, and in practice I believe it to be a very troublesome proceeding; but I am a barrister, Miss Alicia, and able to draw a conclusion by induction. Do you know what inductive evidence is, Miss Audley?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alicia/Miss Audley/Miss Alicia</b></font>)</div>replied Alicia, looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) cousin as a handsome young panther might look at its daring tormentor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought not. I dare say Sir Harry would ask if it was a new kind of horse-ball. I knew by induction that the baronet was going to make you an offer; first, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) came downstairs with his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hair parted on the wrong side, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) face as pale as a tablecloth; secondly, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) couldn't eat any breakfast, and let his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) coffee go the wrong way; and, thirdly, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) asked for an interview with you before he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) left the Court. Well, how's it to be, Alicia? Do we marry the baronet, and is poor Cousin Bob to be the best man at the wedding?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sir Harry Towers is a noble-hearted young man,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alicia/Miss Audley/Miss Alicia</b></font>)</div>said Alicia, still trying to pass her (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) cousin.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But do we accept him (<font color='blue'><b>Towers</b></font>)--yes or no? Are we to be Lady Towers, with a superb estate in Hertfordshire, summer quarters for our hunters, and a drag with outriders to drive us across to papa's place in Essex? Is it to be so, Alicia, or not?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What is that to you, Mr. Robert Audley?''  (<font color='red'><b>Alicia/Miss Audley/Miss Alicia</b></font>)</div>cried Alicia, passionately. ``What do you care what becomes of me, or whom I marry? If I married a chimney-sweep you'd only lift up your eyebrows and say, ``Bless my soul, she (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) was always eccentric.<div class="bookquote">'' I have refused Sir Harry Towers; but when I think of his (<font color='blue'><b>Towers</b></font>) generous and unselfish affection, and compare it with the heartless, lazy, selfish, supercilious indifference of other men, I've a good mind to run after him (<font color='blue'><b>Towers</b></font>) and tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Towers</b></font>)--''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That you'll retract, and be my Lady Towers?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then don't, Alicia, don't,''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>said Robert Audley, grasping his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) cousin's slender little wrist, and leading her (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) up-stairs. <div class="bookquote">``Come into the drawing-room with me, Alicia, my poor little cousin; my charming, impetuous, alarming little cousin. Sit down here in this mullioned window, and let us talk seriously and leave off quarreling if we can.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The cousins</b></font>)</div><p/>The cousins had the drawing-room all to themselves. Sir Michael was out, my lady in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) own apartments, and poor Sir Harry Towers walking up and down upon the gravel walk, darkened with the flickering shadows of the leafless branches in the cold winter sunshine.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My poor little Alicia,''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>said Robert, as tenderly as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) had been addressing some spoiled child, <div class="bookquote">``do you suppose that because people don't wear vinegar tops, or part their hair on the wrong side, or conduct themselves altogether after the manner of well-meaning maniacs, by way of proving the vehemence of their passion--do you suppose because of this, Alicia Audley, that they may not be just as sensible of the merits of a dear little warm-hearted and affectionate girl as ever their neighbors can be? Life is such a very troublesome matter, when all is said and done, that it's as well even to take its blessings quietly. I don't make a great howling because I can get good cigars one door from the corner of Chancery Lane, and have a dear, good girl for my cousin; but I am not the less grateful to Providence that it is so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>some child</b></font>)</div><p/>Alicia opened her (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) gray eyes to their widest extent, looking her (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) cousin full in the face with a bewildered stare. Robert had picked up the ugliest and leanest of his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) attendant curs, and was placidly stroking the animal's ears.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is this all you have to say to me, Robert?''  (<font color='red'><b>Alicia/Miss Audley/Miss Alicia</b></font>)</div>asked Miss Audley, meekly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, yes, I think so,''  (<font color='red'><b>cousin</b></font>)</div>replied her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) cousin, after considerable deliberation. <div class="bookquote">``I fancy that what I wanted to say was this--don't marry the fox-hunting baronet if you like anybody else better; for if you'll only be patient and take life easily, and try and reform yourself of banging doors, bouncing in and out rooms, talking of the stables, and riding across country, I've no doubt the person you prefer will make you a very excellent husband.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you, cousin,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alicia/Miss Audley/Miss Alicia</b></font>)</div>said Miss Audley, crimsoning with bright, indignant blushes up to the roots of her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) waving brown hair; <div class="bookquote">``but as you may not know the person I prefer, I think you had better not take upon yourself to answer for him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Alicia/Miss Audley/Miss Alicia</b></font>)</div><p/>Robert pulled the dog's ears thoughtfully for some moments.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, to be sure,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) said, after a pause. <div class="bookquote">``Of course, if I don't know him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>)--I thought I did.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Alicia/Miss Audley/Miss Alicia</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Alicia; and opening the door with a violence that made her (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) cousin shiver, she (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) bounced out of the drawing-room.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I only said I thought I knew him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>Robert called after her (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>); and, then, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) sunk into an easy-chair, he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) murmured thoughtfully: <div class="bookquote">``Such a nice girl, too, if she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) didn't bounce.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>So poor Sir Harry Towers rode away from Audley Court, looking very crestfallen and dismal.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Towers</b></font>) had very little pleasure in returning to the stately mansion, hidden among sheltering oaks and venerable beeches. The square, red brick house, gleaming at the end of a long arcade of leafless trees was to be forever desolate, he (<font color='blue'><b>Towers</b></font>) thought, since Alicia would not come to be its mistress.

<p/>A hundred improvements planned and thought of were dismissed from his (<font color='blue'><b>Towers</b></font>) mind as useless now. The hunter that Jim the trainer was breaking in for a lady; the two pointer pups that were being reared for the next shooting season; the big black retriever that would have carried Alicia's parasol; the pavilion in the garden, disused since his (<font color='blue'><b>trainer</b></font>) mother's death, but which he (<font color='blue'><b>trainer</b></font>) had meant to have restored for Miss Audley--all these things were now so much vanity and vexation of spirit.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What's the good of being rich if one has no one to help spend one's money?''  (<font color='red'><b>the baronet</b></font>)</div>said the young baronet. <div class="bookquote">``One only grows a selfish beggar, and takes to drinking too much port. It's a hard thing that a girl can refuse a true heart and such stables as we've got at the park. It unsettles a man somehow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the baronet</b></font>)</div><p/>Indeed, this unlooked for rejection had very much unsettled the few ideas which made up the small sum of the baronet's mind.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>trainer</b></font>) had been desperately in love with Alicia ever since the last hunting season, when he (<font color='blue'><b>trainer</b></font>) had met her (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) at the county ball. His (<font color='blue'><b>trainer</b></font>) passion, cherished through the slow monotony of a summer, had broken out afresh in the merry winter months, and the young man's mauvaise honte alone had delayed the offer of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand. But he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had never for a moment supposed that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would be refused; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was so used to the adulation of mothers who had daughters to marry, and of even the daughters themselves; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had been so accustomed to feel himself the leading personage in an assembly, although half the wits of the age had been there, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could only say <div class="bookquote">``Haw, to be sure!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and <div class="bookquote">``By Jove--hum!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had been so spoiled by the flatteries of bright eyes that looked, or seemed to look, the brighter when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) drew near, that without being possessed of one shadow of personal vanity, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had yet come to think that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had only to make an offer to the prettiest girl in Essex to behold himself immediately accepted.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would say complacently to some admiring satellite, ``I know I'm a good match, and I know what makes the gals so civil. They're very pretty, and they're very friendly to a fellow; but I don't care about 'em. They're all alike--they can only drop their eyes and say, ``Lor', Sir Harry, why do you call that curly black dog a retriever?'' or ``Oh Sir Harry, and did the poor mare really sprain her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) pastern shoulder-blade?<div class="bookquote">'' I haven't got much brains myself, I know,''  (<font color='red'><b>the mare</b></font>)</div>the baronet would add deprecatingly; <div class="bookquote">``and I don't want a strong-minded woman, who writes books and wears green spectacles; but, hang it! I like a gal who knows what she (<font color='blue'><b>gal</b></font>)'s talking about.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the baronet</b></font>)</div><p/>So when Alicia said <div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alicia/Miss Audley/Miss Alicia</b></font>)</div>or rather made that pretty speech about esteem and respect, which well-bred young ladies substitute for the obnoxious monosyllable, Sir Harry Towers felt that the whole fabric of the future he (<font color='blue'><b>Towers</b></font>) had built so complacently was shivered into a heap of dingy ruins.

<p/>Sir Michael grasped him (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) warmly by the hand just before the young man mounted his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) horse in the court-yard.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm very sorry, Towers,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``You're as good a fellow as ever breathed, and would have made my girl an excellent husband; but you know there's a cousin, and I think that--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't say that, Sir Michael,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>interrupted the fox-hunter, energetically. <div class="bookquote">``I can get over anything but that. A fellow whose hand upon the curb weighs half a ton -LRB-why, he (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) pulled the Cavalier's mouth to pieces, sir, the day you let him (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) ride the horse-RRB-; a fellow who turns his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) collars down, and eats bread and marmalade! No, no, Sir Michael; it's a queer world, but I can't think that of Miss Audley. There must be some one in the background, sir; it can't be the cousin.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Michael/Michael Audley/Audley</b></font>)</div><p/>Sir Michael shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) head as the rejected suitor rode away.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know about that,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) muttered. <div class="bookquote">``Bob's a good lad, and the girl might do worse; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) hangs back as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) didn't care for her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). There's some mystery--there's some mystery!''

 (<font color='red'><b>The baronet</b></font>)</div><p/>The old baronet said this in that semi-thoughtful tone with which we speak of other people's affairs. The shadows of the early winter twilight, gathering thickest under the low oak ceiling of the hall, and the quaint curve of the arched doorway, fell darkly round his (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) handsome head; but the light of his (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) declining life, his (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) beautiful and beloved young wife, was near him (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) could see no shadows when she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was by.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) came skipping through the hall to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>), and, shaking her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) golden ringlets, buried her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) bright head on her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) husband's breast.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So the last of our visitors is gone, dear, and we're all alone,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Isn't that nice?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, darling,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) answered fondly, stroking her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) bright hair.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Except Mr. Robert Audley. How long is that nephew of yours going to stay here?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``As long as he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) likes, my pet; he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>)'s always welcome,''  (<font color='red'><b>the baronet</b></font>)</div>said the baronet; and then, as if remembering himself, he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) added, tenderly: <div class="bookquote">``But not unless his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) visit is agreeable to you, darling; not if his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) lazy habits, or his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) smoking, or his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) dogs, or anything about him (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) is displeasing to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Lady Audley pursed up her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) rosy lips and looked thoughtfully at the ground.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It isn't that,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) said, hesitatingly. <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Audley is a very agreeable young man, and a very honorable young man; but you know, Sir Michael, I'm rather a young aunt for such a nephew, and--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And what, Lucy?''  (<font color='red'><b>the baronet</b></font>)</div>asked the baronet, fiercely.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Poor Alicia is rather jealous of any attention Mr. Audley pays me, and--and--I think it would be better for her (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) happiness if your nephew were to bring his (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) visit to a close.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) shall go to-night, Lucy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Michael/Michael Audley/Audley</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Sir Michael. <div class="bookquote">``I am a blind, neglectful fool not to have thought of this before. My lovely little darling, it was scarcely just to Bob to expose the poor lad to your fascinations. I know him (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) to be as good and true-hearted a fellow as ever breathed, but--but--he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) shall go tonight.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you won't be too abrupt, dear? You won't be rude?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Rude! No, Lucy. I left him (<font color='blue'><b>Rude</b></font>) smoking in the lime-walk. I'll go and tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Rude</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Rude</b></font>) must get out of the house in an hour.''

 (<font color='red'><b>George/George Talboys/Mr. Talboys</b></font>)</div><p/>So in that leafless avenue, under whose gloomy shade George Talboys had stood on that thunderous evening before the day of his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) disappearance, Sir Michael Audley told his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) nephew that the Court was no home for him (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>), and that my lady was too young and pretty to accept the attentions of a handsome nephew of eight-and-twenty.

<p/>Robert only shrugged his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) shoulders and elevated his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) thick, black eyebrows as Sir Michael delicately hinted all this.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have been attentive to my lady,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) interests me;''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>and then, with a change in his (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) voice, and an emotion not common to him (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) turned to the baronet, and grasping his (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) hand, exclaimed, <div class="bookquote">``God forbid, my dear uncle, that I should ever bring trouble upon such a noble heart as yours! God forbid that the slightest shadow of dishonor should ever fall upon your honored head--least of all through agency of mine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the baronet</b></font>)</div><p/>The young man uttered these few words in a broken and disjointed fashion in which Sir Michael had never heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) speak, before, and then turning away his (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) head, fairly broke down.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) left the court that night, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) did not go far. Instead of taking the evening train for London, he (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) went straight up to the little village of Mount Stanning, and walking into the neatly-kept inn, asked Phoebe Marks if he (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) could be accommodated with apartments.

<p/>CHAPTER XVII.

<p/>AT THE CASTLE INN.

<p/>The little sitting-room into which Phoebe Marks ushered the baronet's nephew was situated on the ground floor, and only separated by a lath-and-plaster partition from the little bar-parlor occupied by the innkeeper and his (<font color='blue'><b>innkeeper</b></font>) wife.

<p/>It seemed as though the wise architect who had superintended the building of the Castle Inn had taken especial care that nothing but the frailest and most flimsy material should be used, and that the wind, having a special fancy for this unprotected spot, should have full play for the indulgence of its caprices.

<p/>To this end pitiful woodwork had been used instead of solid masonry; rickety ceilings had been propped up by fragile rafters, and beams that threatened on every stormy night to fall upon the heads of those beneath them; doors whose specialty was never to be shut, yet always to be banging; windows constructed with a peculiar view to letting in the draft when they were shut, and keeping out the air when they were open. The hand of genius had devised this lonely country inn; and there was not an inch of woodwork, or trowelful of plaster employed in all the rickety construction that did not offer its own peculiar weak point to every assault of its indefatigable foe.

<p/>Robert looked about him (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) with a feeble smile of resignation.

<p/>It was a change, decidedly, from the luxurious comforts of Audley Court, and it was rather a strange fancy of the young barrister to prefer loitering at this dreary village hostelry to returning to his (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) snug chambers in Figtree Court.

<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) had brought his (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) Lares and Penates with him (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>), in the shape of his (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) German pipe, his (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) tobacco canister, half a dozen French novels, and his (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) two ill-conditioned, canine favorites, which sat shivering before the smoky little fire, barking shortly and sharply now and then, by way of hinting for some slight refreshment.

<p/>While Mr. Robert Audley contemplated his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) new quarters, Phoebe Marks summoned a little village lad who was in the habit of running errands for her (<font color='blue'><b>Marks</b></font>), and taking him (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) into the kitchen, gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) a tiny note, carefully folded and sealed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You know Audley Court?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, mum.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you'll run there with this letter to-night, and see that it's put safely in Lady Audley's hands, I'll give you a shilling.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, mum.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You understand? Ask to see my lady; you can say you've a message--not a note, mind--but a message from Phoebe Marks; and when you see her (<font color='blue'><b>Marks</b></font>), give this into her (<font color='blue'><b>Marks</b></font>) own hand.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, mum.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You won't forget?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, mum.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then be off with you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The boy</b></font>)</div><p/>The boy waited for no second bidding, but in another moment was scudding along the lonely high road, down the sharp descent that led to Audley.

<p/>Phoebe Marks went to the window, and looked out at the black figure of the lad hurrying through the dusky winter evening.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If there's any bad meaning in his (<font color='blue'><b>mum</b></font>) coming here,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Marks</b></font>) thought, <div class="bookquote">``my lady will know of it in time, at any rate.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Phoebe herself brought the neatly arranged tea-tray, and the little covered dish of ham and eggs which had been prepared for this unlooked-for visitor. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) pale hair was as smoothly braided, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) light gray dress fitted as precisely as of old. The same neutral tints pervaded her (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) person and her (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) dress; no showy rose-colored ribbons or rustling silk gown proclaimed the well-to-do innkeeper's wife. Phoebe Marks was a person who never lost her (<font color='blue'><b>Marks</b></font>) individuality. Silent and self-constrained, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marks</b></font>) seemed to hold herself within herself, and take no color from the outer world.

<p/>Robert looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Marks</b></font>) thoughtfully as she (<font color='blue'><b>Marks</b></font>) spread the cloth, and drew the table nearer to the fireplace.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) thought, <div class="bookquote">``is a woman who could keep a secret.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The dogs looked rather suspiciously at the quiet figure of Mrs. Marks gliding softly about the room, from the teapot to the caddy, and from the caddy to the kettle singing on the hob.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Will you pour out my tea for me, Mrs. Marks?''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>said Robert, seating himself on a horsehair-covered arm-chair, which fitted him (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) as tightly in every direction as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) had been measured for it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You have come straight from the Court, sir?''  (<font color='red'><b>Phoebe/Phoebe Marks/PHOEBE</b></font>)</div>said Phoebe, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) handed Robert the sugar-basin.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; I only left my uncle's an hour ago.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And my lady, sir, was she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) quite well?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, quite well.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``As gay and light-hearted as ever, sir?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``As gay and light-hearted as ever.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Phoebe/Phoebe Marks/PHOEBE</b></font>)</div><p/>Phoebe retired respectfully after having given Mr. Audley his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) tea, but as she (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) stood with her (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) hand upon the lock of the door he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) spoke again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You knew Lady Audley when she (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) was Miss Lucy Graham, did you not?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir. I lived at Mrs. Dawson's when my lady was governess there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed! Was she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) long in the surgeon's family?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A year and a half, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) came from London?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was an orphan, I believe?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Always as cheerful as she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) is now?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Always, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div><p/>Robert emptied his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) teacup and handed it to Mrs. Marks. Their eyes met--a lazy look in his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>), and an active, searching glance in hers.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This woman would be good in a witness-box,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) thought; <div class="bookquote">``it would take a clever lawyer to bother her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) in a cross-examination.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) finished his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) second cup of tea, pushed away his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) plate, fed his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) dogs, and lighted his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) pipe, while Phoebe carried off the tea-tray.

<p/>The wind came whistling up across the frosty open country, and through the leafless woods, and rattled fiercely at the window-frames.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There's a triangular draught from those two windows and the door that scarcely adds to the comfort of this apartment,''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>murmured Robert; <div class="bookquote">``and there certainly are pleasantér sensations than that of standing up to one's knees in cold water.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) poked the fire, patted his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) dogs, put on his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) great coat, rolled a rickety old sofa close to the hearth, wrapped his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) legs in his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) railway rug, and stretching himself at full length upon the narrow horsehair cushion, smoked his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) pipe, and watched the bluish-gray wreaths curling upward to the dingy ceiling.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) murmured, again; <div class="bookquote">``that is a woman who can keep a secret. A counsel for the prosecution could get very little out of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>I have said that the bar-parlor was only separated from the sitting-room occupied by Robert by a lath-and-plaster partition. The young barrister could hear the two or three village tradesmen and a couple of farmers laughing and talking round the bar, while Luke Marks served them from his (<font color='blue'><b>Marks</b></font>) stock of liquors.

<p/>Very often he (<font color='blue'><b>Marks</b></font>) could even hear their words, especially the landlord's, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Marks</b></font>) spoke in a coarse, loud voice, and had a more boastful manner than any of his (<font color='blue'><b>Marks</b></font>) customers.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The man is a fool,''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>said Robert, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) laid down his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) pipe. <div class="bookquote">``I'll go and talk to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) by-and-by.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) waited till the few visitors to the Castle had dropped away one by one, and when Luke Marks had bolted the door upon the last of his (<font color='blue'><b>Marks</b></font>) customers, he (<font color='blue'><b>Marks</b></font>) strolled quietly into the bar-parlor, where the landlord was seated with his (<font color='blue'><b>Marks</b></font>) wife.

<p/>Phoebe was busy at a little table, upon which stood a prim work-box, with every reel of cotton and glistening steel bodkin in its appointed place. She (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) was darning the coarse gray stockings that adorned her (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) husband's awkward feet, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) did her (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) work as daintily as if they had been my lady's delicate silken hose.

<p/>I say that she (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) took no color from external things, and that the vague air of refinement that pervaded her (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) nature clung to her (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) as closely in the society of her (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) boorish husband at the Castle Inn as in Lady Audley's boudoir at the Court.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) looked up suddenly as Robert entered the bar-parlor. There was some shade of vexation in her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) pale gray eyes, which changed to an expression of anxiety--nay, rather of almost terror--as she (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) glanced from Mr. Audley to Luke Marks.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have come in for a few minutes' chat before I go to bed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>said Robert, settling himself very comfortably before the cheerful fire. <div class="bookquote">``Would you object to a cigar, Mrs. Marks? I mean, of course, to my smoking one,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) added, explanatorily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not at all, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It would be a good `un her (<font color='blue'><b>Marks</b></font>) objectin' to a bit o' `bacca,''  (<font color='red'><b>Luke/Luke Marks/Mr. Marks</b></font>)</div>growled Mr. Marks, <div class="bookquote">``when me and the customers smokes all day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Luke/Luke Marks/Mr. Marks</b></font>)</div><p/>Robert lighted his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) cigar with a gilt-paper match of Phoebe's making that adorned the chimney-piece, and took half a dozen reflective puffs before he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) spoke.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I want you to tell me all about Mount Stanning, Mr. Marks,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) said, presently.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then that's pretty soon told,''  (<font color='red'><b>Luke/Luke Marks/Mr. Marks</b></font>)</div>replied Luke, with a harsh, grating laugh. <div class="bookquote">``Of all the dull holes as ever a man set foot in, this is about the dullest. Not that the business don't pay pretty tidy; I don't complain of that; but I should ha' liked a public at Chelmsford, or Brentwood, or Romford, or some place where there's a bit of life in the streets; and I might have had it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) added, discontentedly, <div class="bookquote">``if folks hadn't been so precious stingy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>As her (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) husband muttered this complaint in a grumbling undertone, Phoebe looked up from her (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) work and spoke to him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We forgot the brew-house door, Luke,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Will you come with me and help me put up the bar?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The brew-house door can bide for to-night,''  (<font color='red'><b>Luke/Luke Marks/Mr. Marks</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Marks; <div class="bookquote">``I ain't agoin' to move now. I've seated myself for a comfortable smoke.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Luke/Luke Marks/Mr. Marks</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Marks</b></font>) took a long clay pipe from a corner of the fender as he (<font color='blue'><b>Marks</b></font>) spoke, and began to fill it deliberately.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't feel easy about that brew-house door, Luke,''  (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div>remonstrated his (<font color='blue'><b>Marks</b></font>) wife; <div class="bookquote">``there are always tramps about, and they can get in easily when the bar isn't up.''

 (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Go and put the bar up yourself, then, can't you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Luke/Luke Marks/Mr. Marks</b></font>)</div>answered Mr. Marks.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's too heavy for me to lift.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then let it bide, if you're too fine a lady to see to it yourself. You're very anxious all of a sudden about this here brew-house door. I suppose you don't want me to open my mouth to this here gent, that's about it. Oh, you needn't frown at me to stop my speaking! You're always putting in your tongue and clipping off my words before I've half said 'em; but I won't stand it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you hear? I won't stand it!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Phoebe/Phoebe Marks/PHOEBE</b></font>)</div><p/>Phoebe Marks shrugged her (<font color='blue'><b>Marks</b></font>) shoulders, folded her (<font color='blue'><b>Marks</b></font>) work, shut her (<font color='blue'><b>Marks</b></font>) work-box, and crossing her (<font color='blue'><b>Marks</b></font>) hands in her (<font color='blue'><b>Marks</b></font>) lap, sat with her (<font color='blue'><b>Marks</b></font>) gray eyes fixed upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Marks</b></font>) husband's bull-like face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then you don't particularly care to live at Mount Stanning?''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>said Robert, politely, as if anxious to change the conversation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I don't,''  (<font color='red'><b>Luke/Luke Marks/Mr. Marks</b></font>)</div>answered Luke; <div class="bookquote">``and I don't care who knows it; and, as I said before, if folks hadn't been so precious stingy, I might have had a public in a thrivin' market town, instead of this tumble-down old place, where a man has his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hair blowed off his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head on a windy day. What's fifty pound, or what's a hundred pound--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Luke/Luke Marks/Mr. Marks</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Luke! Luke!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Luke/Luke Marks/Mr. Marks</b></font>)</div><p/>``No, you're not goin' to stop my mouth with all your ``Luke, Lukes!''' answered Mr. Marks to his (<font color='blue'><b>Marks</b></font>) wife's remonstrance. <div class="bookquote">``I say again, what's a hundred pound?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>answered Robert Audley, with wonderful distinctness, and addressing his (<font color='blue'><b>Marks</b></font>) words to Luke Marks, but fixing his (<font color='blue'><b>Marks</b></font>) eyes upon Phoebe's anxious face. <div class="bookquote">``What, indeed, is a hundred pounds to a man possessed of the power which you hold, or rather which your wife holds, over the person in question.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Phoebe/Phoebe Marks/PHOEBE</b></font>)</div><p/>Phoebe's face, at all times almost colorless, seemed scarcely capable of growing paler; but as her (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) eyelids drooped under Robert Audley's searching glance, a visible change came over the pallid hues of her (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) complexion.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A quarter to twelve,''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>said Robert, looking at his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) watch.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Late hours for such a quiet village as Mount Stanning. Good-night, my worthy host. Good-night, Mrs. Marks. You needn't send me my shaving water till nine o'clock to-morrow morning.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER XVIII.

<p/>ROBERT RECEIVES A VISITOR WHOM HE (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) HAD SCARCELY EXPECTED.

<p/>Eleven o'clock struck the next morning, and found Mr. Robert Audley still lounging over the well ordered little breakfast table, with one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) dogs at each side of his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) arm-chair, regarding him (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) with watchful eyes and opened mouths, awaiting the expected morsel of ham or toast. Robert had a county paper on his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) knees, and made a feeble effort now and then to read the first page, which was filled with advertisements of farming stock, quack medicines, and other interesting matter.

<p/>The weather had changed, and the snow, which had for the last few days been looming blackly in the frosty sky, fell in great feathery flakes against the windows, and lay piled in the little bit of garden-ground without.

<p/>The long, lonely road leading toward Audley seemed untrodden by a footstep, as Robert Audley looked out at the wintry landscape.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Lively,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``for a man used to the fascinations of Temple Bar.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) watched the snow-flakes falling every moment thicker and faster upon the lonely road, he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) was surprised by seeing a brougham driving slowly up the hill.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wonder what unhappy wretch has too restless a spirit to stop at home on such a morning as this,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) muttered, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) returned to the arm-chair by the fire.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) had only reseated himself a few moments when Phoebe Marks entered the room to announce Lady Audley.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Lady Audley! Pray beg her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) to come in,''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>said Robert; and then, as Phoebe left the room to usher in this unexpected visitor, he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) muttered between his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) teeth--<div class="bookquote">``A false move, my lady, and one I never looked for from you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Lucy Audley was radiant on this cold and snowy January morning. Other people's noses are rudely assailed by the sharp fingers of the grim ice-king, but not my lady's; other people's lips turn pale and blue with the chilling influence of the bitter weather, but my lady's pretty little rosebud of a mouth retained its brightest coloring and cheeriest freshness.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was wrapped in the very sables which Robert Audley had brought from Russia, and carried a muff that the young man thought seemed almost as big as herself.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) looked a childish, helpless, babyfied little creature; and Robert looked down upon her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) with some touch of pity in his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) eyes, as she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) came up to the hearth by which he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) was standing, and warmed her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) tiny gloved hands at the blaze.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What a morning, Mr. Audley!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``what a morning!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, indeed! Why did you come out in such weather?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because I wished to see you--particularly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>lady</b></font>)</div>said my lady, with an air of considerable embarrassment, playing with the button of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) glove, and almost wrenching it off in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) restlessness--<div class="bookquote">``yes, Mr. Audley, I felt that you had not been well treated; that--that you had, in short, reason to complain; and that an apology was due to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>lady</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not wish for any apology, Lady Audley.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you are entitled to one,''  (<font color='red'><b>lady</b></font>)</div>answered my lady, quietly. <div class="bookquote">``Why, my dear Robert, should we be so ceremonious toward each other? You were very comfortable at Audley; we were very glad to have you there; but, my dear, silly husband must needs take it into his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) foolish head that it is dangerous for his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) poor little wife's peace of mind to have a nephew of eight or nine and twenty smoking his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) cigars in her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) boudoir, and, behold! our pleasant little family circle is broken up.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lucy Audley</b></font>)</div><p/>Lucy Audley spoke with that peculiar childish vivacity which seemed so natural to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), Robert looking down almost sadly at her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) bright, animated face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Lady Audley,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Heaven forbid that either you or I should ever bring grief or dishonor upon my uncle's generous heart! Better, perhaps, that I should be out of the house--better, perhaps, that I had never entered it!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>My lady had been looking at the fire while her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) nephew spoke, but at his (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) last words she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) lifted her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) head suddenly, and looked him (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) full in the face with a wondering expression--an earnest, questioning gaze, whose full meaning the young barrister understood.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, pray do not be alarmed, Lady Audley,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) said, gravely. <div class="bookquote">``You have no sentimental nonsense, no silly infatuation, borrowed from Balzac or Dumas fils, to fear from me. The benchers of the Inner Temple will tell you that Robert Audley is troubled with none of the epidemics whose outward signs are turn-down collars and Byronic neckties. I say that I wish I had never entered my uncle's house during the last year; but I say it with a far more solemn meaning than any sentimental one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>lady</b></font>)</div><p/>My lady shrugged her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) shoulders.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you insist on talking in enigmas, Mr. Audley,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``you must forgive a poor little woman if she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) declines to answer them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Robert made no reply to this speech.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But tell me,''  (<font color='red'><b>lady</b></font>)</div>said my lady, with an entire change of tone, <div class="bookquote">``what could have induced you to come up to this dismal place?''

 (<font color='red'><b>lady</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Curiosity.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Curiosity?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; I felt an interest in that bull-necked man, with the dark-red hair and wicked gray eyes. A dangerous man, my lady--a man in whose power I should not like to be.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Audley/LADY AUDLEY</b></font>)</div><p/>A sudden change came over Lady Audley's face; the pretty, roseate flush faded out from her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) cheeks, and left them waxen white, and angry flashes lightened in her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) blue eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What have I done to you, Robert Audley,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) cried, passionately--<div class="bookquote">``what have I done to you that you should hate me so?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) answered her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) very gravely:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I had a friend, Lady Audley, whom I loved very dearly, and since I have lost him (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) I fear that my feelings toward other people are strangely embittered.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You mean the Mr. Talboys who went to Australia?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I mean the Mr. Talboys who I was told set out for Liverpool with the idea of going to Australia.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you do not believe in his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) having sailed for Australia?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But why not?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Forgive me, Lady Audley, if I decline to answer that question.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``As you please,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) said, carelessly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A week after my friend disappeared,''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>continued Robert, <div class="bookquote">``I posted an advertisement to the Sydney and Melbourne papers, calling upon him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) was in either city when the advertisement appeared, to write and tell me of his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) whereabouts, and also calling on any one who had met him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>), either in the colonies or on the voyage out, to give me any information respecting him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>). George Talboys left Essex, or disappeared from Essex, on the 6th of September last. I ought to receive some answer to this advertisement by the end of this month. To-day is the 27th; the time draws very near.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And if you receive no answer?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Audley/LADY AUDLEY</b></font>)</div>asked Lady Audley.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If I receive no answer I shall think that my fears have been not unfounded, and I shall do my best to act.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you mean by that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, Lady Audley, you remind me how very powerless I am in this matter. My friend might have been made away with in this very inn, and I might stay here for a twelvemonth, and go away at the last as ignorant of his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) fate as if I had never crossed the threshold. What do we know of the mysteries that may hang about the houses we enter? If I were to go to-morrow into that commonplace, plebeian, eight-roomed house in which Maria Manning and her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) husband murdered their guest, I should have no awful prescience of that bygone horror. Foul deeds have been done under the most hospitable roofs; terrible crimes have been committed amid the fairest scenes, and have left no trace upon the spot where they were done. I do not believe in mandrake, or in bloodstains that no time can efface. I believe rather that we may walk unconsciously in an atmosphere of crime, and breathe none the less freely. I believe that we may look into the smiling face of a murderer, and admire its tranquil beauty.''

 (<font color='red'><b>lady</b></font>)</div><p/>My lady laughed at Robert's earnestness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You seem to have quite a taste for discussing these horrible subjects,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said, rather scornfully; <div class="bookquote">``you ought to have been a detective police officer.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I sometimes think I should have been a good one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because I am patient.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But to return to Mr. George Talboys, whom we lost sight of in your eloquent discussion. What if you receive no answer to your advertisements?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall then consider myself justified in concluding my friend is dead.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, and then--?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall examine the effects he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) left at my chambers.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed! and what are they? Coats, waistcoats, varnished boots, and meerschaum pipes, I suppose,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Audley/LADY AUDLEY</b></font>)</div>said Lady Audley, laughing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No; letters--letters from his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) friends, his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) old schoolfellows, his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) father, his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) brother officers.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Letters, too, from his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) wife.''

 (<font color='red'><b>lady</b></font>)</div><p/>My lady was silent for some few moments, looking thoughtfully at the fire.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you ever seen any of the letters written by the late Mrs. Talboys?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) asked presently.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Never. Poor soul! her (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) letters are not likely to throw much light upon my friend's fate. I dare say she (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) wrote the usual womanly scrawl. There are very few who write so charming and uncommon a hand as yours, Lady Audley.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, you know my hand, of course.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I know it very well indeed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>lady</b></font>)</div><p/>My lady warmed her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) hands once more, and then taking up the big muff which she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had laid aside upon a chair, prepared to take her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) departure.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You have refused to accept my apology, Mr. Audley,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``but I trust you are not the less assured of my feelings toward you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perfectly assured, Lady Audley.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then good-by, and let me recommend you not to stay long in this miserable draughty place, if you do not wish to take rheumatism back to Figtree Court.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall return to town to-morrow morning to see after my letters.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then once more good-by.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) held out her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) hand; he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) took it loosely in his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) own. It seemed such a feeble little hand that he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) might have crushed it in his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) strong grasp, had he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) chosen to be so pitiless.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) attended her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) carriage, and watched it as it drove off, not toward Audley, but in the direction of Brentwood, which was about six miles from Mount Stanning.

<p/>About an hour and a half after this, as Robert stood at the door of the inn, smoking a cigar and watching the snow falling in the whitened fields opposite, he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) saw the brougham drive back, empty this time, to the door of the inn.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you taken Lady Audley back to the Court?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) said to the coachman, who had stopped to call for a mug of hot spiced ale.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, sir; I've just come from the Brentwood station. My lady started for London by the 12.40 train.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``For town?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My lady gone to London!''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>said Robert, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) returned to the little sitting-room. <div class="bookquote">``Then I'll follow her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) by the next train; and if I'm not very much mistaken, I know where to find her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) packed his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) portmanteau, paid his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) bill, fastened his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) dogs together with a couple of leathern collars and a chain, and stepped into the rumbling fly kept by the Castle Inn for the convenience of Mount Stanning. He (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) caught an express that left Brentwood at three o'clock, and settled himself comfortably in a corner of an empty first-class carriage, coiled up in a couple of railway rugs, and smoking a cigar in mild defiance of the authorities.

<p/>CHAPTER XIX.

<p/>THE WRITING IN THE BOOK.

<p/>It was exactly five minutes past four as Mr. Robert Audley stepped out upon the platform at Shoreditch, and waited placidly until such time as his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) dogs and his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) portmanteau should be delivered up to the attendant porter who had called his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) cab, and undertaken the general conduct of his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) affairs, with that disinterested courtesy which does such infinite credit to a class of servitors who are forbidden to accept the tribute of a grateful public.

<p/>Robert Audley waited with consummate patience for a considerable time; but as the express was generally a long train, and as there were a great many passengers from Norfolk carrying guns and pointers, and other paraphernalia of a critical description, it took a long while to make matters agreeable to all claimants, and even the barrister's seraphic indifference to mundane affairs nearly gave way.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps, when that gentleman who is making such a noise about a pointer with liver-colored spots, has discovered the particular pointer and spots that he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) wants--which happy combination of events scarcely seems likely to arrive--they'll give me my luggage and let me go. The designing wretches knew at a glance that I was born to be imposed upon; and that if they were to trample the life out of me upon this very platform, I should never have the spirit to bring an action against the company.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>Suddenly an idea seemed to strike him (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) left the porter to struggle for the custody of his (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) goods, and walked round to the other side of the station.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) heard a bell ring, and looking at the clock, had remembered that the down train for Colchester started at this time. He (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) had learned what it was to have an earnest purpose since the disappearance of George Talboys; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) reached the opposite platform in time to see the passengers take their seats.

<p/>There was one lady who had evidently only just arrived at the station; for she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) hurried on to the platform at the very moment that Robert approached the train, and almost ran against that gentleman in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) haste and excitement.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I beg your pardon,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) began, ceremoniously; then raising her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) eyes from Mr. Audley's waistcoat, which was about on a level with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) pretty face, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) exclaimed, <div class="bookquote">``Robert, you in London already?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Lady Audley; you were quite right; the Castle Inn is a dismal place, and--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You got tired of it--I knew you would. Please open the carriage door for me: the train will start in two minutes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div><p/>Robert Audley was looking at his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) uncle's wife with rather a puzzled expression of countenance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What does it mean?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) thought. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) is altogether a different being to the wretched, helpless creature who dropped her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) mask for a moment, and looked at me with her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) own pitiful face, in the little room at Mount Stanning, four hours ago. What has happened to cause the change?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) opened the door for her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) while he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) thought this, and helped her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) to settle herself in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) seat, spreading her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) furs over her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) knees, and arranging the huge velvet mantle in which her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) slender little figure was almost hidden.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you very much; how good you are to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) did this. <div class="bookquote">``You will think me very foolish to travel upon such a day, without my dear darling's knowledge too; but I went up to town to settle a very terrific milliner's bill, which I did not wish my best of husbands to see; for, indulgent as he (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) is, he (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) might think me extravagant; and I cannot bear to suffer even in his (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) thoughts.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Heaven forbid that you ever should, Lady Audley,''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>Robert said, gravely.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) for a moment with a smile, which had something defiant in its brightness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Heaven forbid it, indeed,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) murmured. <div class="bookquote">``I don't think I ever shall.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>The second bell rung, and the train moved as she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) spoke. The last Robert Audley saw of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was that bright defiant smile.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Whatever object brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) to London has been successfully accomplished,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) thought. <div class="bookquote">``Has she (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) baffled me by some piece of womanly jugglery? Am I never to get any nearer to the truth, but am I to be tormented all my life by vague doubts, and wretched suspicions, which may grow upon me till I become a monomaniac? Why did she (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) come to London?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) was still mentally asking himself this question as he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) ascended the stairs in Figtree Court, with one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) dogs under each arm, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) railway rugs over his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) shoulder.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) found his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) chambers in their accustomed order. The geraniums had been carefully tended, and the canaries had retired for the night under cover of a square of green baize, testifying to the care of honest Mrs. Maloney. Robert cast a hurried glance round the sitting-room; then setting down the dogs upon the hearth-rug, he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) walked straight into the little inner chamber which served as his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) dressing-room.

<p/>It was in this room that he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) kept disused portmanteaus, battered japanned cases, and other lumber; and it was in this room that George Talboys had left his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) luggage. Robert lifted a portmanteau from the top of a large trunk, and kneeling down before it with a lighted candle in his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) hand, carefully examined the lock.

<p/>To all appearance it was exactly in the same condition in which George had left it, when he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) laid his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) mourning garments aside and placed them in this shabby repository with all other memorials of his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) dead wife. Robert brushed his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) coat sleeve across the worn, leather-covered lid, upon which the initials G. T. were inscribed with big brass-headed nails; but Mrs. Maloney, the laundress, must have been the most precise of housewives, for neither the portmanteau nor the trunk were dusty.

<p/>Mr. Audley dispatched a boy to fetch his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) Irish attendant, and paced up and down his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) sitting-room waiting anxiously for her (<font color='blue'><b>Maloney</b></font>) arrival.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Maloney</b></font>) came in about ten minutes, and, after expressing her (<font color='blue'><b>Maloney</b></font>) delight in the return of <div class="bookquote">``the master,''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>humbly awaited his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) orders.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I only sent for you to ask if anybody has been here; that is to say, if anybody has applied to you for the key of my rooms to-day--any lady?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Lady? No, indeed, yer honor; there's been no lady for the kay; barrin' it's the blacksmith.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The blacksmith!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; the blacksmith your honor ordered to come to-day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I order a blacksmith!''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Robert. <div class="bookquote">``I left a bottle of French brandy in the cupboard,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) thought, <div class="bookquote">``and Mrs. M. has been evidently enjoying herself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sure, and the blacksmith your honor tould to see to the locks,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Maloney</b></font>)</div>replied Mrs. Maloney. <div class="bookquote">``It's him (<font color='blue'><b>blacksmith</b></font>) that lives down in one of the little streets by the bridge,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maloney</b></font>) added, giving a very lucid description of the man's whereabouts.

<p/>Robert lifted his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) eyebrows in mute despair.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you'll sit down and compose yourself, Mrs. M.,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) said--he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) abbreviated her (<font color='blue'><b>Maloney</b></font>) name thus on principle, for the avoidance of unnecessary labor--<div class="bookquote">``perhaps we shall be able by and by to understand each other. You say a blacksmith has been here?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sure and I did, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To-day?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Quite correct, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div><p/>Step by step Mr. Audley elicited the following information. A locksmith had called upon Mrs. Maloney that afternoon at three o'clock, and had asked for the key of Mr. Audley's chambers, in order that he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) might look to the locks of the doors, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) stated were all out of repair. He (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) declared that he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) was acting upon Mr. Audley's own orders, conveyed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) by a letter from the country, where the gentleman was spending his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) Christmas. Mrs. Maloney, believing in the truth of this statement, had admitted the man to the chambers, where he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stayed about half an hour.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But you were with him (<font color='blue'><b>blacksmith</b></font>) while he (<font color='blue'><b>blacksmith</b></font>) examined the locks, I suppose?''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>Mr. Audley asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sure I was, sir, in and out, as you may say, all the time, for I've been cleaning the stairs this afternoon, and I took the opportunity to begin my scouring while the man was at work.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, you were in and out all the time. If you could conveniently give me a plain answer, Mrs. M., I should be glad to know what was the longest time that you were out while the locksmith was in my chambers?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Maloney</b></font>)</div><p/>But Mrs. Maloney could not give a plain answer. It might have been ten minutes; though she (<font color='blue'><b>Maloney</b></font>) didn't think it was as much. It might have been a quarter of an hour; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Maloney</b></font>) was sure it wasn't more. It didn't seem to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maloney</b></font>) more than five minutes, but <div class="bookquote">``thim stairs, your honor;''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and here she (<font color='blue'><b>Maloney</b></font>) rambled off into a disquisition upon the scouring of stairs in general, and the stairs outside Robert's chambers in particular.

<p/>Mr. Audley sighed the weary sigh of mournful resignation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Never mind, Mrs. M.,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``the locksmith had plenty of time to do anything he (<font color='blue'><b>locksmith</b></font>) wanted to do, I dare say, without your being any the wiser.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Maloney stared at her (<font color='blue'><b>Maloney</b></font>) employer with mingled surprise and alarm.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sure, there wasn't anything for him (<font color='blue'><b>locksmith</b></font>) to stale, your honor, barrin' the birds and the geran`ums, and--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no, I understand. There, that'll do, Mrs. M. Tell me where the man lives, and I'll go and see him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you'll have a bit of dinner first, sir?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll go and see the locksmith before I have my dinner.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) took up his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) hat as he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) announced his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) determination, and walked toward the door.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The man's address, Mrs. M?''

 (<font color='red'><b>The Irishwoman</b></font>)</div><p/>The Irishwoman directed him (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) to a small street at the back of St. Bride's Church, and thither Mr. Robert Audley quietly strolled, through the miry slush which simple Londoners call snow.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) found the locksmith, and, at the sacrifice of the crown of his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) hat, contrived to enter the low, narrow doorway of a little open shop. A jet of gas was flaring in the unglazed window, and there was a very merry party in the little room behind the shop; but no one responded to Robert's <div class="bookquote">``Hulloa!''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>The reason of this was sufficiently obvious. The merry party was so much absorbed in its own merriment as to be deaf to all commonplace summonses from the outer world; and it was only when Robert, advancing further into the cavernous little shop, made so bold as to open the half-glass door which separated him (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) from the merry-makers, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) succeeded in obtaining their attention.

<p/>A very jovial picture of the Teniers school was presented to Mr. Robert Audley upon the opening of this door.

<p/>The locksmith, with his (<font color='blue'><b>locksmith</b></font>) wife and family, and two or three droppers-in of the female sex, were clustered about a table, which was adorned by two bottles; not vulgar bottles of that colorless extract of the juniper berry, much affected by the masses; but of bona fide port and sherry--fiercely strong sherry, which left a fiery taste in the mouth, nut-brown sherry--rather unnaturally brown, if anything--and fine old port; no sickly vintage, faded and thin from excessive age: but a rich, full-bodied wine, sweet and substantial and high colored.

<p/>The locksmith was speaking as Robert Audley opened the door.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And with that,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>M.</b></font>) walked off, as graceful as you please.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The whole party was thrown into confusion by the appearance of Mr. Audley, but it was to be observed that the locksmith was more embarrassed than his (<font color='blue'><b>locksmith</b></font>) companions. He (<font color='blue'><b>locksmith</b></font>) set down his (<font color='blue'><b>locksmith</b></font>) glass so hurriedly, that he (<font color='blue'><b>locksmith</b></font>) spilt his (<font color='blue'><b>locksmith</b></font>) wine, and wiped his (<font color='blue'><b>locksmith</b></font>) mouth nervously with the back of his (<font color='blue'><b>locksmith</b></font>) dirty hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You called at my chambers to-day,''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>Robert said, quietly. <div class="bookquote">``Don't let me disturb you, ladies.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>This to the droppers-in. <div class="bookquote">``You called at my chambers to-day, Mr. White, and--''

 (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div><p/>The man interrupted him (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope, sir, you will be so good as to look over the mistake,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) stammered. <div class="bookquote">``I'm sure, sir, I'm very sorry it should have occurred. I was sent for to another gentleman's chambers, Mr. Aulwin, in Garden Court; and the name slipped my memory; and havin' done odd jobs before for you, I thought it must be you as wanted me to-day; and I called at Mrs. Maloney's for the key accordin'; but directly I see the locks in your chambers, I says to myself, the gentleman's locks ain't out of order; the gentleman don't want all his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) locks repaired.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you stayed half an hour.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir; for there was one lock out of order--the door nighest the staircase--and I took it off and cleaned it and put it on again. I won't charge you nothin' for the job, and I hope as you'll be as good as to look over the mistake as has occurred, which I've been in business thirteen years come July, and--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing of this kind ever happened before, I suppose,''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>said Robert, gravely. <div class="bookquote">``No, it's altogether a singular kind of business, not likely to come about every day. You've been enjoying yourself this evening I see, Mr. White. You've done a good stroke of work to-day, I'll wager--made a lucky hit, and you're what you call `standing treat,''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>eh?''

<p/>Robert Audley looked straight into the man's dingy face as he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) spoke. The locksmith was not a bad-looking fellow, and there was nothing that he (<font color='blue'><b>locksmith</b></font>) need have been ashamed of in his (<font color='blue'><b>locksmith</b></font>) face, except the dirt, and that, as Hamlet's mother says, <div class="bookquote">``is common;''  (<font color='red'><b>Hamlet mother</b></font>)</div>but in spite of this, Mr. White's eyelids dropped under the young barrister's calm scrutiny, and he (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>) stammered out some apologetic sort of speech about his (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``missus,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and his (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>) missus' neighbors, and port wine and sherry wine, with as much confusion as if he (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>), an honest mechanic in a free country, were called upon to excuse himself to Robert Audley for being caught in the act of enjoying himself in his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) own parlor.

<p/>Robert cut him (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) short with a careless nod.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Pray don't apologize,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``I like to see people enjoy themselves. Good-night, Mr. White good-night, ladies.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) lifted his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) hat to <div class="bookquote">``the missus,''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>and the missus' neighbors, who were much fascinated by his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) easy manner and his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) handsome face, and left the shop.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And so,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) muttered to himself as he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) went back to his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) chambers, ''`with that she (<font color='blue'><b>missus</b></font>) walked off as graceful as you please.<div class="bookquote">``Who was it that walked off; and what was the story which the locksmith was telling when I interrupted him (<font color='blue'><b>locksmith</b></font>) at that sentence? Oh, George Talboys, George Talboys, am I ever to come any nearer to the secret of your fate? Am I coming nearer to it now, slowly but surely? Is the radius to grow narrower day by day until it draws a dark circle around the home of those I love? How is it all to end?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) sighed wearily as he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) walked slowly back across the flagged quadrangles in the Temple to his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) own solitary chambers.

<p/>Mrs. Maloney had prepared for him (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) that bachelor's dinner, which, however excellent and nutritious in itself, has no claim to the special charm of novelty. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maloney</b></font>) had cooked for him (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) a mutton-chop, which was soddening itself between two plates upon the little table near the fire.

<p/>Robert Audley sighed as he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) sat down to the familiar meal, remembering his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) uncle's cook with a fond, regretful sorrow.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Her (<font color='blue'><b>missus</b></font>) cutlets a la Maintenon made mutton seem more than mutton; a sublimated meat that could scarcely have grown upon any mundane sheep,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) murmured sentimentally, <div class="bookquote">``and Mrs. Maloney's chops are apt to be tough; but such is life--what does it matter?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) pushed away his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) plate impatiently after eating a few mouthfuls.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have never eaten a good dinner at this table since I lost George Talboys,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``The place seems as gloomy as if the poor fellow had died in the next room, and had never been taken away to be buried. How long ago that September afternoon appears as I look back at it--that September afternoon upon which I parted with him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) alive and well; and lost him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) as suddenly and unaccountably as if a trap-door had opened in the solid earth and let him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) through to the antipodes!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Audley rose from the dinner-table and walked over to the cabinet in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) kept the document he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) had drawn up relating to George Talboys. He (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) unlocked the doors of his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) cabinet, took the paper from the pigeon-hole marked important, and seated himself at his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) desk to write. He (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) added several paragraphs to those in the document, numbering the fresh paragraphs as carefully as he (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) had numbered the old ones.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Heaven help us all,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) muttered once; <div class="bookquote">``is this paper with which no attorney has had any hand to be my first brief?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) wrote for about half an hour, then replaced the document in the pigeon-hole, and locked the cabinet. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) had done this, he (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) took a candle in his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) hand, and went into the room in which were his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) own portmanteaus and the trunk belonging to George Talboys.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) took a bunch of keys from his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) pocket, and tried them one by one. The lock of the shabby old trunk was a common one, and at the fifth trial the key turned easily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There'd be no need for any one to break open such a lock as this,''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>muttered Robert, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) lifted the lid of the trunk.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) slowly emptied it of its contents, taking out each article separately, and laying it carefully upon a chair by his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) side. He (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) handled the things with a respectful tenderness, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) had been lifting the dead body of his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) lost friend. One by one he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) laid the neatly folded mourning garments on the chair. He (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) found old meerschaum pipes, and soiled, crumpled gloves that had once been fresh from the Parisian maker; old play-bills, whose biggest letters spelled the names of actors who were dead and gone; old perfume-bottles, fragrant with essences, whose fashion had passed away; neat little parcels of letters, each carefully labeled with the name of the writer; fragments of old newspapers; and a little heap of shabby, dilapidated books, each of which tumbled into as many pieces as a pack of cards in Robert's incautious hand. But among all the mass of worthless litter, each scrap of which had once had its separate purpose, Robert Audley looked in vain for that which he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) sought--the packet of letters written to the missing man by his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) dead wife Helen Talboys. He (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) had heard George allude more than once to the existence of these letters. He (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) had seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) once sorting the faded papers with a reverent hand; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) had seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) replace them, carefully tied together with a faded ribbon which had once been Helen's, among the mourning garments in the trunk. Whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) had afterward removed them, or whether they had been removed since his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) disappearance by some other hand, it was not easy to say; but they were gone.

<p/>Robert Audley sighed wearily as he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) replaced the things in the empty box, one by one, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) had taken them out. He (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) stopped with the little heap of tattered books in his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) hand, and hesitated for a moment.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I will keep these out,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) muttered, <div class="bookquote">``there may be something to help me in one of them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>George's library was no very brilliant collection of literature. There was an old Greek Testament and the Eton Latin Grammar; a French pamphlet on the cavalry sword-exercise; an odd volume of Tom Jones with one half of its stiff leather cover hanging to it by a thread; Byron's Don Juan, printed in a murderous type, which must have been invented for the special advantage of oculists and opticians; and a fat book in a faded gilt and crimson cover.

<p/>Robert Audley locked the trunk and took the books under his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) arm. Mrs. Maloney was clearing away the remains of his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) repast when he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) returned to the sitting-room. He (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) put the books aside on a little table in a corner of the fire-place, and waited patiently while the laundress finished her (<font color='blue'><b>Maloney</b></font>) work. He (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) was in no humor even for his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) meerschaum consoler; the yellow-papered fictions on the shelves above his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) head seemed stale and profitless--he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) opened a volume of Balzac, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) uncle's wife's golden curls danced and trembled in a glittering haze, alike upon the metaphysical diablerie of the Peau de Chagrin, and the hideous social horrors of <div class="bookquote">``Cousine Bette.''  (<font color='red'><b>uncle wife</b></font>)</div>The volume dropped from his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) hand, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) sat wearily watching Mrs. Maloney as she (<font color='blue'><b>Maloney</b></font>) swept up the ashes on the hearth, replenished the fire, drew the dark damask curtains, supplied the simple wants of the canaries, and put on her (<font color='blue'><b>Maloney</b></font>) bonnet in the disused clerk's office, prior to bidding her (<font color='blue'><b>Maloney</b></font>) employer good-night. As the door closed upon the Irishwoman, he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) arose impatiently from his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) chair, and paced up and down the room.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why do I go on with this,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``when I know that it is leading me, step by step, day by day, hour by hour, nearer to that conclusion which, of all others, I should avoid? Am I tied to a wheel, and must I go with its every revolution, let it take me where it will? Or can I sit down here to-night and say I have done my duty to my missing friend, I have searched for him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) patiently, but I have searched in vain? Should I be justified in doing this? Should I be justified in letting the chain which I have slowly put together, link by link, drop at this point, or must I go on adding fresh links to that fatal chain until the last rivet drops into its place and the circle is complete? I think, and I believe, that I shall never see my friend's face again; and that no exertion of mine can ever be of any benefit to him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>). In plainer, crueler words I believe him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) to be dead. Am I bound to discover how and where he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) died? or being, as I think, on the road to that discovery, shall I do a wrong to the memory of George Talboys by turning back or stopping still? What am I to do?--what am I to do?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) rested his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) elbows on his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) knees, and buried his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) face in his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) hands. The one purpose which had slowly grown up in his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) careless nature until it had become powerful enough to work a change in that very nature, made him (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) what he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) had never been before--a Christian; conscious of his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) own weakness; anxious to keep to the strict line of duty; fearful to swerve from the conscientious discharge of the strange task that had been forced upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>); and reliant on a stronger hand than his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) own to point the way which he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) was to go. Perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) uttered his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) first earnest prayer that night, seated by his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) lonely fireside, thinking of George Talboys. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) head from that long and silent revery, his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) eyes had a bright, determined glance, and every feature in his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) face seemed to wear a new expression.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Justice to the dead first,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``mercy to the living afterward.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) wheeled his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) easy-chair to the table, trimmed the lamp, and settled himself to the examination of the books.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) took them up, one by one, and looked carefully through them, first looking at the page on which the name of the owner is ordinarily written, and then searching for any scrap of paper which might have been left within the leaves. On the first page of the Eton Latin Grammar the name of Master Talboys was written in a prim, scholastic hand; the French pamphlet had a careless G.T. scrawled on the cover in pencil, in George's big, slovenly calligraphy: the Tom Jones had evidently been bought at a book-stall, and bore an inscription, dated March 14th, 1788, setting forth that the book was a tribute of respect to Mr. Thos. Scrowton, from his (<font color='blue'><b>Thos</b></font>) obedient servant, James Anderley; the Don Juan and the Testament were blank. Robert Audley breathed more freely; he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) had arrived at the last but one of the books without any result whatever, and there only remained the fat gilt-and-crimson-bound volume to be examined before his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) task was finished.

<p/>It was an annual of the year 1845. The copper-plate engravings of lovely ladies, who had flourished in that day, were yellow and spotted with mildew; the costumes grotesque and outlandish; the simpering beauties faded and commonplace. Even the little clusters of verses -LRB-in which the poet's feeble candle shed its sickly light upon the obscurities of the artist's meaning-RRB- had an old-fashioned twang; like music on a lyre, whose strings are slackened by the damps of time. Robert Audley did not stop to read any of the mild productions. He (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) ran rapidly through the leaves, looking for any scrap of writing or fragment of a letter which might have been used to mark a place. He (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) found nothing but a bright ring of golden hair, of that glittering hue which is so rarely seen except upon the head of a child--a sunny lock, which curled as naturally as the tendril of a vine; and was very opposite in texture, if not different in hue, to the soft, smooth tresses which the landlady at Ventnor had given to George Talboys after his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) wife's death. Robert Audley suspended his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) examination of the book, and folded this yellow lock in a sheet of letter paper, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) sealed with his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) signet-ring, and laid aside, with the memorandum about George Talboys and Alicia's letter, in the pigeon-hole marked important. He (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) was going to replace the fat annual among the other books, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) discovered that the two blank leaves at the beginning were stuck together. He (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) was so determined to prosecute his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) search to the very uttermost, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) took the trouble to part these leaves with the sharp end of his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) paper-knife, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) was rewarded for his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) perseverance by finding an inscription upon one of them. This inscription was in three parts, and in three different hands. The first paragraph was dated as far back as the year in which the annual had been published, and set forth that the book was the property of a certain Miss Elizabeth Ann Bince, who had obtained the precious volume as a reward for habits of order, and for obedience to the authorities of Camford House Seminary, Torquay. The second paragraph was dated five years later, and was in the handwriting of Miss Bince herself, who presented the book, as a mark of undying affection and unfading esteem -LRB-Miss Bince was evidently of a romantic temperament-RRB- to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ann</b></font>) beloved friend, Helen Maldon. The third paragraph was dated September, 1853, and was in the hand of Helen Maldon, who gave the annual to George Talboys; and it was at the sight of this third paragraph that Mr. Robert Audley's face changed from its natural hue to a sickly, leaden pallor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought it would be so,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the young man, shutting the book with a weary sigh. <div class="bookquote">``God knows I was prepared for the worst, and the worst has come. I can understand all now. My next visit must be to Southampton. I must place the boy in better hands.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER XX.

<p/>MRS. PLOWSON.

<p/>Among the packet of letters which Robert Audley had found in George's trunk, there was one labeled with the name of the missing man's father--the father, who had never been too indulgent a friend to his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) younger son, and who had gladly availed himself of the excuse afforded by George's imprudent marriage to abandon the young man to his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) own resources. Robert Audley had never seen Mr. Harcourt Talboys; but George's careless talk of his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) father had given his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) friend some notion of that gentleman's character. He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) had written to Mr. Talboys immediately after the disappearance of George, carefully wording his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) letter, which vaguely hinted at the writer's fear of some foul play in the mysterious business; and, after the lapse of several weeks, he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) had received a formal epistle, in which Mr. Harcourt Talboys expressly declared that he (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) had washed his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) hands of all responsibility in his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) son George's affairs upon the young man's wedding-day; and that his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) absurd disappearance was only in character with his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) preposterous marriage. The writer of this fatherly letter added in a postscript that if George Talboys had any low design of alarming his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) friends by this pretended disappearance, and thereby playing on their feelings with a view to pecuniary advantage, he (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) was most egregiously deceived in the character of those persons with whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) had to deal.

<p/>Robert Audley had answered this letter by a few indignant lines, informing Mr. Talboys that his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) son was scarcely likely to hide himself for the furtherance of any deep-laid design on the pockets of his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) relatives, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) had left twenty thousand pounds in his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) bankers' hands at the time of his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) disappearance. After dispatching this letter, Robert had abandoned all thought of assistance from the man who, in the natural course of things, should have been most interested in George's fate; but now that he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) found himself advancing every day some step nearer to the end that lay so darkly before him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>), his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) mind reverted to this heartlessly indifferent Mr. Harcourt Talboys.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I will run into Dorsetshire after I leave Southampton,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``and see this man. If he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is content to let his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) son's fate rest a dark and cruel mystery to all who knew him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)--if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is content to go down to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) grave uncertain to the last of this poor fellow's end--why should I try to unravel the tangled skein, to fit the pieces of the terrible puzzle, and gather together the stray fragments which, when collected, may make such a hideous whole? I will go to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and lay my darkest doubts freely before him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). It will be for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to say what I am to do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Robert Audley started by an early express for Southampton. The snow lay thick and white upon the pleasant country through which he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) went; and the young barrister had wrapped himself in so many comforters and railway rugs as to appear a perambulating mass of woollen goods, rather than a living member of a learned profession. He (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) looked gloomily out of the misty window, opaque with the breath of himself and an elderly Indian officer, who was his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) only companion, and watched the fleeting landscape, which had a certain phantom-like appearance in its shroud of snow. He (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) wrapped himself in the vast folds of his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) railway rug, with a peevish shiver, and felt inclined to quarrel with the destiny which compelled him (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) to travel by an early train upon a pitiless winter's day.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who would have thought that I could have grown so fond of the fellow,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) muttered, <div class="bookquote">``or feel so lonely without him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)? I've a comfortable little fortune in the three per cents.; I'm heir presumptive to my uncle's title; and I know of a certain dear little girl who, as I think, would do her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) best to make me happy; but I declare that I would freely give up all, and stand penniless in the world to-morrow, if this mystery could be satisfactorily cleared away, and George Talboys could stand by my side.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) reached Southampton between eleven and twelve o'clock, and walked across the platform, with the snow drifting in his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) face, toward the pier and the lower end of the town. The clock of St. Michael's Church was striking twelve as he (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) crossed the quaint old square in which that edifice stands, and groped his (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) way through the narrow streets leading down to the water.

<p/>Mr. Maldon had established his (<font color='blue'><b>Maldon</b></font>) slovenly household gods in one of those dreary thoroughfares which speculative builders love to raise upon some miserable fragment of waste ground hanging to the skirts of a prosperous town. Brigsome's Terrace was, perhaps, one of the most dismal blocks of building that was ever composed of brick and mortar since the first mason plied his (<font color='blue'><b>mason</b></font>) trowel and the first architect drew his (<font color='blue'><b>mason</b></font>) plan. The builder who had speculated in the ten dreary eight-roomed prison-houses had hung himself behind the parlor door of an adjacent tavern while the carcases were yet unfinished. The man who had bought the brick and mortar skeletons had gone through the bankruptcy court while the paper-hangers were still busy in Brigsome's Terrace, and had whitewashed his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ceilings and himself simultaneously. Ill luck and insolvency clung to the wretched habitations. The bailiff and the broker's man were as well known as the butcher and the baker to the noisy children who played upon the waste ground in front of the parlor windows. Solvent tenants were disturbed at unhallowed hours by the noise of ghostly furniture vans creeping stealthily away in the moonless night. Insolvent tenants openly defied the collector of the water-rate from their ten-roomed strongholds, and existed for weeks without any visible means of procuring that necessary fluid.

<p/>Robert Audley looked about him (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) with a shudder as he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) turned from the waterside into this poverty-stricken locality. A child's funeral was leaving one of the houses as he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) approached, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) thought with a thrill of horror that if the little coffin had held George's son, he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) would have been in some measure responsible for the boy's death.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The poor child shall not sleep another night in this wretched hovel,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) thought, as he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) knocked at the door of Mr. Maldon's house. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) is the legacy of my best friend, and it shall be my business to secure his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) safety.''

 (<font color='red'><b>A girl</b></font>)</div><p/>A slipshod servant girl opened the door and looked at Mr. Audley rather suspiciously as she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>), very much through her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) nose, what he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) pleased to want. The door of the little sitting room was ajar, and Robert could hear the clattering of knives and forks and the childish voice of little George prattling gayly. He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) told the servant that he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) had come from London, that he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) wanted to see Master Talboys, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) would announce himself; and walking past her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), without further ceremony he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) opened the door of the parlor. The girl stared at him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) aghast as he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) did this; and as if struck by some sudden and terrible conviction, threw her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) apron over her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) head and ran out into the snow. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) darted across the waste ground, plunged into a narrow alley, and never drew breath till she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) found herself upon the threshold of a certain tavern called the Coach and Horses, and much affected by Mr. Maldon. The lieutenant's faithful retainer had taken Robert Audley for some new and determined collector of poor's rates--rejecting that gentleman's account of himself as an artful fiction devised for the destruction of parochial defaulters--and had hurried off to give her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) master timely warning of the enemy's approach.

<p/>When Robert entered the sitting-room he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) was surprised to find little George seated opposite to a woman who was doing the honors of a shabby repast, spread upon a dirty table-cloth, and flanked by a pewter beer measure. The woman rose as Robert entered, and courtesied very humbly to the young barrister. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) looked about fifty years of age, and was dressed in rusty widow's weeds. Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) complexion was insipidly fair, and the two smooth bands of hair beneath her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) cap were of that sunless, flaxen hue which generally accompanies pink cheeks and white eyelashes. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had been a rustic beauty, perhaps, in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) time, but her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) features, although tolerably regular in their shape, had a mean, pinched look, as if they had been made too small for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) face. This defect was peculiarly noticeable in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) mouth, which was an obvious misfit for the set of teeth it contained. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) smiled as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) courtesied to Mr. Robert Audley, and her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) smile, which laid bare the greater part of this set of square, hungry-looking teeth, by no means added to the beauty of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) personal appearance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Maldon is not at home, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said, with insinuating civility; <div class="bookquote">``but if it's for the water-rate, he (<font color='blue'><b>Maldon</b></font>) requested me to say that--''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was interrupted by little George Talboys, who scrambled down from the high chair upon which he (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) had been perched, and ran to Robert Audley.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I know you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``you came to Ventnor with the big gentleman, and you came here once, and you gave me some money, and I gave it to gran`pa to take care of, and gran`pa kept it, and he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) always does.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Robert Audley took the boy in his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) arms, and carried him (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) to a little table in the window.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Stand there, Georgey,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I want to have a good look at you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) turned the boy's face to the light, and pushed the brown curls off his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) forehead with both hands.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are growing more like your father every day, Georgey; and you're growing quite a man, too,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``would you like to go to school?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes, please, I should like it very much,''  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div>the boy answered, eagerly. <div class="bookquote">``I went to school at Miss Pevins' once--day-school, you know--round the corner in the next street; but I caught the measles, and gran`pa wouldn't let me go any more, for fear I should catch the measles again; and gran`pa won't let me play with the little boys in the street, because they're rude boys; he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) said blackguard boys; but he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) said I mustn't say blackguard boys, because it's naughty. He (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) says damn and devil, but he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) says he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) may because he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)'s old. I shall say damn and devil when I'm old; and I should like to go to school, please, and I can go to-day, if you like; Mrs. Plowson will get my frocks ready, won't you, Mrs. Plowson?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly, Master Georgey, if your grandpapa wishes it,''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>the woman answered, looking rather uneasily at Mr. Robert Audley.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What on earth is the matter with this woman,''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>thought Robert as he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) turned from the boy to the fair-haired widow, who was edging herself slowly toward the table upon which little George Talboys stood talking to his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) guardian. <div class="bookquote">``Does she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) still take me for a tax-collector with inimical intentions toward these wretched goods and chattels; or can the cause of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) fidgety manner lie deeper still. That's scarcely likely, though; for whatever secrets Lieutenant Maldon may have, it's not very probable that this woman has any knowledge of them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Plowson/MRS. PLOWSON/Plowson</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Plowson had edged herself close to the little table by this time, and was making a stealthy descent upon the boy, when Robert turned sharply round.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What are you going to do with the child?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I was only going to take him (<font color='blue'><b>Lieutenant</b></font>) away to wash his (<font color='blue'><b>Lieutenant</b></font>) pretty face, sir, and smooth his (<font color='blue'><b>Lieutenant</b></font>) hair,''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>answered the woman, in the most insinuating tone in which she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had spoken of the water-rate. <div class="bookquote">``You don't see him (<font color='blue'><b>Lieutenant</b></font>) to any advantage, sir, while his (<font color='blue'><b>Lieutenant</b></font>) precious face is dirty. I won't be five minutes making him (<font color='blue'><b>Lieutenant</b></font>) as neat as a new pin.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) long, thin arms about the boy as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) spoke, and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was evidently going to carry him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) off bodily, when Robert stopped her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'd rather see him (<font color='blue'><b>Lieutenant</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Lieutenant</b></font>) is, thank you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``My time in Southampton isn't very long, and I want to hear all that the little man can tell me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div><p/>The little man crept closer to Robert, and looked confidingly into the barrister's gray eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I like you very much,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I was frightened of you when you came before, because I was shy. I am not shy now--I am nearly six years old.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div><p/>Robert patted the boy's head encouragingly, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) was not looking at little George; he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) was watching the fair-haired widow, who had moved to the window, and was looking out at the patch of waste ground.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You're rather fidgety about some one, ma'am, I'm afraid,''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>said Robert.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) colored violently as the barrister made this remark, and answered him (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) in a confused manner.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I was looking for Mr. Maldon, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Maldon</b></font>)'ll be so disappointed if he (<font color='blue'><b>Maldon</b></font>) doesn't see you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You know who I am, then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, sir, but--''

 (<font color='red'><b>The boy</b></font>)</div><p/>The boy interrupted her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) by dragging a little jeweled watch from his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) bosom and showing it to Robert.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This is the watch the pretty lady gave me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I've got it now--but I haven't had it long, because the jeweler who cleans it is an idle man, gran`pa says, and always keeps it such a long time; and gran`pa says it will have to be cleaned again, because of the taxes. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) always takes it to be cleaned when there's taxes--but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) says if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) were to lose it the pretty lady would give me another. Do you know the pretty lady?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, Georgey, but tell me about her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Plowson/MRS. PLOWSON/Plowson</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Plowson made another descent upon the boy. She (<font color='blue'><b>Plowson</b></font>) was armed with a pocket-handkerchief this time, and displayed great anxiety about the state of little George's nose, but Robert warded off the dreaded weapon, and drew the child away from his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) tormentor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The boy will do very well, ma'am,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``if you'll be good enough to let him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) alone for five minutes. Now, Georgey, suppose you sit on my knee, and tell me all about the pretty lady.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The child clambered from the table onto Mr. Audley's knees, assisting his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) descent by a very unceremonious manipulation of his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) guardian's coat-collar.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll tell you all about the pretty lady,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``because I like you very much. Gran`pa told me not to tell anybody, but I'll tell you, you know, because I like you, and because you're going to take me to school. The pretty lady came here one night--long ago--oh, so long ago,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said the boy, shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) head, with a face whose solemnity was expressive of some prodigious lapse of time. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) came when I was not nearly so big as I am now--and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) came at night--after I'd gone to bed, and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) came up into my room, and sat upon the bed, and cried--and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) left the watch under my pillow, and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)--Why do you make faces at me, Mrs. Plowson? I may tell this gentleman,''  (<font color='red'><b>Georgey/Master Georgey</b></font>)</div>Georgey added, suddenly addressing the widow, who was standing behind Robert's shoulder.

<p/>Mrs. Plowson mumbled some confused apology to the effect that she (<font color='blue'><b>Plowson</b></font>) was afraid Master George was troublesome.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Suppose you wait till I say so, ma'am, before you stop the little fellow's mouth,''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>said Robert Audley, sharply. <div class="bookquote">``A suspicious person might think from your manner that Mr. Maldon and you had some conspiracy between you, and that you were afraid of what the boy's talk may let slip.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) rose from his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) chair, and looked full at Mrs. Plowson as he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) said this. The fair-haired widow's face was as white as her (<font color='blue'><b>Plowson</b></font>) cap when she (<font color='blue'><b>Plowson</b></font>) tried to answer him (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>), and her (<font color='blue'><b>Plowson</b></font>) pale lips were so dry that she (<font color='blue'><b>Plowson</b></font>) was compelled to wet them with her (<font color='blue'><b>Plowson</b></font>) tongue before the words would come.

<p/>The little boy relieved her (<font color='blue'><b>Plowson</b></font>) embarrassment.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't be cross to Mrs. Plowson,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Plowson is very kind to me. Mrs. Plowson is Matilda's mother. You don't know Matilda. Poor Matilda was always crying; she (<font color='blue'><b>Matilda</b></font>) was ill, she (<font color='blue'><b>Matilda</b></font>)--''

 (<font color='red'><b>The boy</b></font>)</div><p/>The boy was stopped by the sudden appearance of Mr. Maldon, who stood on the threshold of the parlor door staring at Robert Audley with a half-drunken, half-terrified aspect, scarcely consistent with the dignity of a retired naval officer. The servant girl, breathless and panting, stood close behind her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) master. Early in the day though it was, the old man's speech was thick and confused, as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) addressed himself fiercely to Mrs. Plowson.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You're a prett' creature to call yoursel' sensible woman?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Why don't you take th' chile `way, er wash 's face? D'yer want to ruin me? D'yer want to `stroy me? Take th' chile `way! Mr. Audley, sir, I'm ver' glad to see yer; ver' `appy to `ceive yer in m' humbl' `bode,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>the old man added with tipsy politeness, dropping into a chair as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) spoke, and trying to look steadily at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) unexpected visitor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Whatever this man's secrets are,''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>thought Robert, as Mrs. Plowson hustled little George Talboys out of the room, <div class="bookquote">``that woman has no unimportant share of them. Whatever the mystery may be, it grows darker and thicker at every step; but I try in vain to draw back or to stop short upon the road, for a stronger hand than my own is pointing the way to my lost friend's unknown grave.''

 (<font color='red'><b>George/George Talboys/Mr. Talboys</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER XXI.

<p/>LITTLE GEORGEY LEAVES HIS (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) OLD HOME.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am going to take your grandson away with me, Mr. Maldon,''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>Robert said gravely, as Mrs. Plowson retired with her (<font color='blue'><b>Plowson</b></font>) young charge.

<p/>The old man's drunken imbecility was slowly clearing away like the heavy mists of a London fog, through which the feeble sunshine struggles dimly to appear. The very uncertain radiance of Lieutenant Maldon's intellect took a considerable time in piercing the hazy vapors of rum-and-water; but the flickering light at last faintly glimmered athwart the clouds, and the old man screwed his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) poor wits to the sticking-point.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said, feebly; <div class="bookquote">``take the boy away from his (<font color='blue'><b>Maldon</b></font>) poor old grandfather; I always thought so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You always thought that I should take him (<font color='blue'><b>Maldon</b></font>) away?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>scrutinizing the half-drunken countenance with a searching glance. <div class="bookquote">``Why did you think so, Mr. Maldon?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the lieutenant</b></font>)</div><p/>The fogs of intoxication got the better of the light of sobriety for a moment, and the lieutenant answered vaguely:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thought so--'cause I thought so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the lieutenant</b></font>)</div><p/>Meeting the young barrister's impatient frown, he (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) made another effort, and the light glimmered again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Because I thought you or his (<font color='blue'><b>Maldon</b></font>) father would fetch 'm away.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``When I was last in this house, Mr. Maldon, you told me that George Talboys had sailed for Australia.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, yes--I know, I know,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man shuffling</b></font>)</div>the old man answered, confusedly, shuffling his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) scanty limp gray hairs with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) two wandering hands--<div class="bookquote">``I know; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) might have come back--mightn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>)? He (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) was restless, and--and--queer in his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) mind, perhaps, sometimes. He (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) might have come back.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the man shuffling</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) repeated this two or three times in feeble, muttering tones; groping about on the littered mantle-piece for a dirty-looking clay pipe, and filling and lighting it with hands that trembled violently.

<p/>Robert Audley watched those poor, withered, tremulous fingers dropping shreds of tobacco upon the hearth rug, and scarcely able to kindle a lucifer for their unsteadiness. Then walking once or twice up and down the little room, he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) left the old man to take a few puffs from the great consoler.

<p/>Presently he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) turned suddenly upon the half-pay lieutenant with a dark solemnity in his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) handsome face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Maldon,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) said, slowly watching the effect of every syllable as he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) spoke, <div class="bookquote">``George Talboys never sailed for Australia--that I know. More than this, he (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) never came to Southampton; and the lie you told me on the 8th of last September was dictated to you by the telegraphic message which you received on that day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The dirty clay pipe dropped from the tremulous hand, and shivered against the iron fender, but the old man made no effort to find a fresh one; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sat trembling in every limb, and looking, Heaven knows how piteously, at Robert Audley.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The lie was dictated to you, and you repeated your lesson. But you no more saw George Talboys here on the 7th of September than I see him (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) in this room now. You thought you had burnt the telegraphic message, but you had only burnt a part of it--the remainder is in my possession.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lieutenant</b></font>)</div><p/>Lieutenant Maldon was quite sober now.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What have I done?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Maldon</b></font>) murmured, hopelessly. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, my God! what have I done?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``At two o'clock on the 7th of September last,''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>continued the pitiless, accusing voice, <div class="bookquote">``George Talboys was seen alive and well at a house in Essex.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div><p/>Robert paused to see the effect of these words. They had produced no change in the old man. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) still sat trembling from head to foot, and staring with the fixed and solid gaze of some helpless wretch whose every sense is gradually becoming numbed by terror.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``At two o'clock on that day,''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>remarked Robert Audley, <div class="bookquote">``my poor friend was seen alive and well at ----, at the house of which I speak. From that hour to this I have never been able to hear that he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) has been seen by any living creature. I have taken such steps as must have resulted in procuring the information of his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) whereabouts, were he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) alive. I have done this patiently and carefully--at first, even hopefully. Now I know that he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) is dead.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div><p/>Robert Audley had been prepared to witness some considerable agitation in the old man's manner, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) was not prepared for the terrible anguish, the ghastly terror, which convulsed Mr. Maldon's haggard face as he (<font color='blue'><b>Maldon</b></font>) uttered the last word.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no, no, no,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lieutenant</b></font>)</div>reiterated the lieutenant, in a shrill, half-screaming voice; <div class="bookquote">``no, no! For God's sake, don't say that! Don't think it--don't let me think it--don't let me dream of it! Not dead--anything but dead! Hidden away, perhaps--bribed to keep out of the way, perhaps; but not dead--not dead--not dead!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the lieutenant</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Maldon</b></font>) cried these words aloud, like one beside himself, beating his (<font color='blue'><b>Maldon</b></font>) hands upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Maldon</b></font>) gray head, and rocking backward and forward in his (<font color='blue'><b>Maldon</b></font>) chair. His (<font color='blue'><b>Maldon</b></font>) feeble hands trembled no longer--they were strengthened by some convulsive force that gave them a new power.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I believe,''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>said Robert, in the same solemn, relentless voice, <div class="bookquote">``that my friend left Essex; and I believe he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) died on the 7th of September last.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div><p/>The wretched old man, still beating his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hands among his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thin gray hair, slid from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) chair to the ground, and groveled at Robert's feet.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! no, no--for God's, no!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) shrieked hoarsely. <div class="bookquote">``No! you don't know what you say--you don't know what your words mean!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know their weight and value only too well--as well as I see you do, Mr. Maldon. God help us!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, what am I doing? what am I doing?''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>muttered the old man, feebly; then raising himself from the ground with an effort, he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) drew himself to his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) full height, and said, in a manner which was new to him (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>), and which was not without a certain dignity of his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) own--that dignity which must be always attached to unutterable misery, in whatever form it may appear--he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) said, gravely:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You have no right to come here and terrify a man who has been drinking, and who is not quite himself. You have no right to do it, Mr. Audley. Even the--the officer, sir, who--who--.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) did not stammer, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) lips trembled so violently that his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) words seemed to be shaken into pieces by their motion. <div class="bookquote">``The officer, I repeat, sir, who arrests a--thief, or a--.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) stopped to wipe his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) lips, and to still them if he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) could by doing so, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) could not. <div class="bookquote">``A thief or a murderer--''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) voice died suddenly away upon the last word, and it was only by the motion of those trembling lips that Robert knew what he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) meant. <div class="bookquote">``Gives him (<font color='blue'><b>thief</b></font>) warning, sir, fair warning, that he (<font color='blue'><b>thief</b></font>) may say nothing which shall commit himself--or--or--other people. The--the--law, sir, has that amount of mercy for a--a--suspected criminal. But you, sir,--you come to my house, and you come at a time when--when--contrary to my usual habits--which, as people will tell you, are sober--you take the opportunity to--terrify me--and it is not right, sir--it is--''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Whatever he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) would have said died away into inarticulate gasps, which seemed to choke him (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>), and sinking into a chair, he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) dropped his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) face upon the table, and wept aloud. Perhaps in all the dismal scenes of domestic misery which had been acted in those spare and dreary houses--in all the petty miseries, the burning shames, the cruel sorrows, the bitter disgraces which own poverty for their father--there had never been such a scene as this. An old man hiding his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face from the light of day, and sobbing aloud in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wretchedness. Robert Audley contemplated the painful picture with a hopeless and pitying face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If I had known this,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) thought, <div class="bookquote">``I might have spared him (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>). It would have been better, perhaps, to have spared him (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The shabby room, the dirt, the confusion, the figure of the old man, with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) gray head upon the soiled tablecloth, amid the muddled débris of a wretched dinner, grew blurred before the sight of Robert Audley as he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) thought of another man, as old as this one, but, ah! how widely different in every other quality! who might come by and by to feel the same, or even a worse anguish, and to shed, perhaps, yet bitterer tears. The moment in which the tears rose to his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) eyes and dimmed the piteous scene before him (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>), was long enough to take him (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) back to Essex, and to show him (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) the image of his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) uncle, stricken by agony and shame.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why do I go on with this?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) thought; <div class="bookquote">``how pitiless I am, and how relentlessly I am carried on. It is not myself; it is the hand which is beckoning me further and further upon the dark road, whose end I dare not dream of.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) thought this, and a hundred times more than this, while the old man sat with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face still hidden, wrestling with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) anguish, but without power to keep it down.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Maldon,''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>Robert Audley said, after a pause, <div class="bookquote">``I do not ask you to forgive me for what I have brought upon you, for the feeling is strong within me that it must have come to you sooner or later--if not through me, through some one else. There are--''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) stopped for a moment hesitating. The sobbing did not cease; it was sometimes low, sometimes loud, bursting out with fresh violence, or dying away for an instant, but never ceasing. <div class="bookquote">``There are some things which, as people say, cannot be hidden. I think there is truth in that common saying which had its origin in that old worldly wisdom which people gathered from experience and not from books. If--if I were content to let my friend rest in his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) hidden grave, it is but likely that some stranger who had never heard the name of George Talboys, might fall by the remotest accident upon the secret of his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) death. To-morrow, perhaps; or ten years hence, or in another generation, when the--the hand that wronged him (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) is as cold as his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) own. If I could let the matter rest; if--if I could leave England forever, and purposely fly from the possibility of ever coming across another clew to the secret, I would do it--I would gladly, thankfully do it--but I cannot! A hand which is stronger than my own beckons me on. I wish to take no base advantage of you, less than of all other people; but I must go on; I must go on. If there is any warning you would give to any one, give it. If the secret toward which I am traveling day by day, hour by hour, involves any one in whom you have an interest, let that person fly before I come to the end. Let them leave this country; let them leave all who know them--all whose peace their wickedness has endangered; let them go away--they shall not be pursued. But if they slight your warning--if they try to hold their present position in defiance of what it will be in your power to tell them--let them beware of me, for, when the hour comes, I swear that I will not spare them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div><p/>The old man looked up for the first time, and wiped his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wrinkled face upon a ragged silk handkerchief.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I declare to you that I do not understand you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I solemnly declare to you that I cannot understand; and I do not believe that George Talboys is dead.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I would give ten years of my own life if I could see him (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) alive,''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>answered Robert, sadly. <div class="bookquote">``I am sorry for you, Mr. Maldon--I am sorry for all of us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not believe that my son-in-law is dead,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lieutenant</b></font>)</div>said the lieutenant; <div class="bookquote">``I do not believe that the poor lad is dead.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the lieutenant</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>lieutenant</b></font>) endeavored in a feeble manner to show to Robert Audley that his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) wild outburst of anguish had been caused by his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) grief for the loss of George; but the pretense was miserably shallow.

<p/>Mrs. Plowson re-entered the room, leading little Georgey, whose face shone with that brilliant polish which yellow soap and friction can produce upon the human countenance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear heart alive!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Plowson/MRS. PLOWSON/Plowson</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Mrs. Plowson, <div class="bookquote">``what has the poor old gentleman been taking on about? We could hear him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) in the passage, sobbin' awful.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Plowson/MRS. PLOWSON/Plowson</b></font>)</div><p/>Little George crept up to his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) grandfather, and smoothed the wet and wrinkled face with his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) pudgy hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't cry, gran`pa,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``don't cry. You shall have my watch to be cleaned, and the kind jeweler shall lend you the money to pay the taxman while he (<font color='blue'><b>taxman</b></font>) cleans the watch--I don't mind, gran`pa.. Let's go to the jeweler, the jeweler in High street, you know, with golden balls painted upon his (<font color='blue'><b>jeweler</b></font>) door, to show that he (<font color='blue'><b>jeweler</b></font>) comes from Lombar--Lombardshire,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said the boy, making a dash at the name. <div class="bookquote">``Come, gran`pa.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The little fellow took the jeweled toy from his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) bosom and made for the door, proud of being possessed of a talisman, which he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) had seen so often made useful.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There are wolves at Southampton,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) said, with rather a triumphant nod to Robert Audley. <div class="bookquote">``My gran`pa says when he (<font color='blue'><b>jeweler</b></font>) takes my watch that he (<font color='blue'><b>jeweler</b></font>) does it to keep the wolf from the door. Are there wolves where you live?''

 (<font color='red'><b>The barrister</b></font>)</div><p/>The young barrister did not answer the child's question, but stopped him (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) was dragging his (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) grandfather toward the door.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your grandpapa does not want the watch to-day, Georgey,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) said, gravely.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why is he (<font color='blue'><b>Georgey</b></font>) sorry, then?''  (<font color='red'><b>Georgey/Master Georgey</b></font>)</div>asked Georgey, naively; <div class="bookquote">``when he (<font color='blue'><b>Georgey</b></font>) wants the watch he (<font color='blue'><b>Georgey</b></font>) is always sorry, and beats his (<font color='blue'><b>Georgey</b></font>) poor forehead so'' (<font color='red'><b>Georgey/Master Georgey</b></font>)</div>--the boy stopped to pantomime with his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) small fists--``and says that she (<font color='blue'><b>Georgey</b></font>)--the pretty lady, I think he (<font color='blue'><b>Georgey</b></font>) means--uses him (<font color='blue'><b>Georgey</b></font>) very hard, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Georgey</b></font>) can't keep the wolf from the door; and then I say, ``Gran`pa, have the watch;' and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Georgey</b></font>) takes me in his (<font color='blue'><b>Georgey</b></font>) arms, and says, <div class="bookquote">``Oh, my blessed angel! how can I rob my blessed angel?''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>and then he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) cries, but not like to-day--not loud, you know; only tears running down his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) poor cheeks, not so that you could hear him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) in the passage.''

<p/>Painful as the child's prattle was to Robert Audley, it seemed a relief to the old man. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did not hear the boy's talk, but walked two or three times up and down the little room and smoothed his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) rumpled hair and suffered his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cravat to be arranged by Mrs. Plowson, who seemed very anxious to find out the cause of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) agitation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Poor dear old gentleman,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Plowson</b></font>) said, looking at Robert.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What has happened to upset him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) so?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``His (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) son-in-law is dead,''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>answered Mr. Audley, fixing his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) eyes upon Mrs. Plowson's sympathetic face. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) died, within a year and a half after the death of Helen Talboys, who lies buried in Ventnor churchyard.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The face into which he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) was looking changed very slightly, but the eyes that had been looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) shifted away as he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) spoke, and Mrs. Plowson was obliged to moisten her (<font color='blue'><b>Plowson</b></font>) white lips with her (<font color='blue'><b>Plowson</b></font>) tongue before she (<font color='blue'><b>Plowson</b></font>) answered him (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Poor Mr. Talboys dead!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Plowson</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``that is bad news indeed, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Little George looked wistfully up at his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) guardian's face as this was said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who's dead?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``George Talboys is my name. Who's dead?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Another person whose name is Talboys, Georgey.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Poor person! Will he (<font color='blue'><b>Georgey</b></font>) go to the pit-hole?''

 (<font color='red'><b>The boy</b></font>)</div><p/>The boy had that notion of death which is generally imparted to children by their wise elders, and which always leads the infant mind to the open grave and rarely carries it any higher.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I should like to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Georgey</b></font>) put in the pit-hole,''  (<font color='red'><b>Georgey/Master Georgey</b></font>)</div>Georgey remarked, after a pause. He (<font color='blue'><b>Georgey</b></font>) had attended several infant funerals in the neighborhood, and was considered valuable as a mourner on account of his (<font color='blue'><b>mourner</b></font>) interesting appearance. He (<font color='blue'><b>mourner</b></font>) had come, therefore, to look upon the ceremony of interment as a solemn festivity; in which cake and wine, and a carriage drive were the leading features.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You have no objection to my taking Georgey away with me, Mr. Maldon?''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>asked Robert Audley.

<p/>The old man's agitation had very much subsided by this time. He (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) had found another pipe stuck behind the tawdry frame of the looking-glass, and was trying to light it with a bit of twisted newspaper.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You do not object, Mr. Maldon?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, sir--no, sir; you are his (<font color='blue'><b>Maldon</b></font>) guardian, and you have a right to take him (<font color='blue'><b>Maldon</b></font>) where you please. He (<font color='blue'><b>Maldon</b></font>) has been a very great comfort to me in my lonely old age, but I have been prepared to lose him (<font color='blue'><b>Maldon</b></font>). I--I may not have always done my duty to him (<font color='blue'><b>Maldon</b></font>), sir, in--in the way of schooling, and--and boots. The number of boots which boys of his (<font color='blue'><b>Maldon</b></font>) age wear out, sir, is not easily realized by the mind of a young man like yourself; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has been kept away from school, perhaps, sometimes, and occasionally worn shabby boots when our funds have got low; but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has not been unkindly treated. No, sir; if you were to question him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) for a week, I don't think you'd hear that his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) poor old grandfather ever said a harsh word to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Georgie</b></font>)</div><p/>Upon this, Georgie, perceiving the distress of his (<font color='blue'><b>Georgie</b></font>) old protector, set up a terrible howl, and declared that he (<font color='blue'><b>Georgie</b></font>) would never leave him (<font color='blue'><b>Georgie</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Maldon,''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>said Robert Audley, with a tone which was half-mournful, half-compassionate, <div class="bookquote">``when I looked at my position last night, I did not believe that I could ever come to think it more painful than I thought it then. I can only say--God have mercy upon us all. I feel it my duty to take the child away, but I shall take him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) straight from your house to the best school in Southampton; and I give you my honor that I will extort nothing from his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) innocent simplicity which can in any manner--I mean,''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) said, breaking off abruptly, <div class="bookquote">``I mean this. I will not seek to come one step nearer the secret through him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>). I--I am not a detective officer, and I do not think the most accomplished detective would like to get his (<font color='blue'><b>detective</b></font>) information from a child.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The old man did not answer; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sat with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face shaded by his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand, and with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) extinguished pipe between the listless fingers of the other.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Take the boy away, Mrs. Plowson,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said, after a pause; <div class="bookquote">``take him (<font color='blue'><b>detective</b></font>) away and put his (<font color='blue'><b>detective</b></font>) things on.

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Which I do say that it's not kind of the gentleman to take his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) poor grandpa's pet away,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Plowson/MRS.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hush, Mrs. Plowson,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>the old man answered, piteously; <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Audley is the best judge. I--I haven't many years to live; I sha'n't trouble anybody long.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/>The tears oozed slowly through the dirty fingers with which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shaded his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) blood-shot eyes, as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said this.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``God knows, I never injured your friend, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said, by-and-by, when Mrs. Plowson and Georgey had returned, <div class="bookquote">``nor even wished him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) any ill. He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was a good son-in-law to me--better than many a son. I never did him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) any wilful wrong, sir. I--I spent his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) money, perhaps, but I am sorry for it--I am very sorry for it now. But I don't believe he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) is dead--no, sir; no, I don't believe it!''  (<font color='red'><b>Georgey/Master Georgey</b></font>)</div>exclaimed the old man, dropping his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes, and looking with new energy at Robert Audley. <div class="bookquote">``I--I don't believe it, sir! How--how should he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) be dead?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div><p/>Robert did not answer this eager questioning. He (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) head mournfully, and, walking to the little window, looked out across a row of straggling geraniums at the dreary patch of waste ground on which the children were at play.

<p/>Mrs. Plowson returned with little Georgey muffled in a coat and comforter, and Robert took the boy's hand.

<p/>The little fellow sprung toward the old man, and clinging about him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), kissed the dirty tears from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) faded cheeks.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't be sorry for me, gran`pa,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``I am going to school to learn to be a clever man, and I shall come home to see you and Mrs. Plowson, sha'n't I?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) added, turning to Robert.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, my dear, by-and-by.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Take him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) away, sir--take him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) away,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Maldon/Maldon</b></font>)</div>cried Mr. Maldon; <div class="bookquote">``you are breaking my heart.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Maldon/Maldon</b></font>)</div><p/>The little fellow trotted away contentedly at Robert's side. He (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) was very well pleased at the idea of going to school, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) had been happy enough with his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) drunken old grandfather, who had always displayed a maudlin affection for the pretty child, and had done his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) best to spoil Georgey, by letting him (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) have his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) own way in everything; in consequence of which indulgence, Master Talboys had acquired a taste for late hours, hot suppers of the most indigestible nature, and sips of rum-and-water from his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) grandfather's glass.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) communicated his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) sentiments upon many subjects to Robert Audley, as they walked to the Dolphin Hotel; but the barrister did not encourage him (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) to talk.

<p/>It was no very difficult matter to find a good school in such a place as Southampton. Robert Audley was directed to a pretty house between the Bar and the Avenue, and leaving Georgey to the care of a good-natured waiter, who seemed to have nothing to do but to look out of the window, and whisk invisible dust off the brightly polished tables, the barrister walked up the High street toward Mr. Marchmont's academy for young gentlemen.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Marchmont</b></font>) found Mr. Marchmont a very sensible man, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Marchmont</b></font>) met a file of orderly-looking young gentlemen walking townward under the escort of a couple of ushers as he (<font color='blue'><b>Marchmont</b></font>) entered the house.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Marchmont</b></font>) told the schoolmaster that little George Talboys had been left in his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) charge by a dear friend, who had sailed for Australia some months before, and whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) believed to be dead. He (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) confided him (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) to Mr. Marchmont's especial care, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Marchmont</b></font>) further requested that no visitors should be admitted to see the boy unless accredited by a letter from himself. Having arranged the matter in a very few business-like words, he (<font color='blue'><b>Marchmont</b></font>) returned to the hotel to fetch Georgey.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Georgey</b></font>) found the little man on intimate terms with the idle waiter, who had been directing Master Georgey's attention to the different objects of interest in the High street.

<p/>Poor Robert had about as much notion of the requirements of a child as he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) had of those of a white elephant. He (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) had catered for silkworms, guinea-pigs, dormice, canary-birds, and dogs, without number, during his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) boyhood, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) had never been called upon to provide for a young person of five years old.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) looked back five-and-twenty years, and tried to remember his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) own diet at the age of five.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've a vague recollection of getting a good deal of bread and milk and boiled mutton,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) thought; <div class="bookquote">``and I've another vague recollection of not liking them. I wonder if this boy likes bread and milk and boiled mutton.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) stood pulling his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) thick mustache and staring thoughtfully at the child for some minutes before he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) could get any further.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I dare say you're hungry, Georgey?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) said, at last.

<p/>The boy nodded, and the waiter whisked some more invisible dust from the nearest table as a preparatory step toward laying a cloth.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps you'd like some lunch?''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>Mr. Audley suggested, still pulling his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) mustache.

<p/>The boy burst out laughing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Lunch!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) cried. <div class="bookquote">``Why, it's afternoon, and I've had my dinner.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div><p/>Robert Audley felt himself brought to a standstill. What refreshment could he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) possibly provide for a boy who called it afternoon at three o'clock?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You shall have some bread and milk, Georgey,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) said, presently. <div class="bookquote">``Waiter, bread and milk, and a pint of hock.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Master</b></font>)</div><p/>Master Talboys made a wry face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I never have bread and milk,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I don't like it. I like what gran`pa calls something savory. I should like a veal cutlet. Gran`pa told me he (<font color='blue'><b>Waiter</b></font>) dined here once, and the veal cutlets were lovely, gran`pa said. Please may I have a veal cutlet, with egg and bread-crumb, you know, and lemon-juice you know?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) added to the waiter: <div class="bookquote">``Gran`pa knows the cook here. The cook's such a nice gentleman, and once gave me a shilling, when gran`pa brought me here. The cook wears better clothes than gran`pa--better than yours, even,''  (<font color='red'><b>the waiter</b></font>)</div>said Master Georgey, pointing to Robert's rough great-coat with a depreciating nod.

<p/>Robert Audley stared aghast. How was he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) to deal with this epicure of five years old, who rejected bread and milk and asked for veal cutlets?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll tell you what I'll do with you, little Georgey,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) exclaimed, after a pause--<div class="bookquote">``I'll give you a dinner!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The waiter nodded briskly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Upon my word, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) said, approvingly, <div class="bookquote">``I think the little gentleman will know how to eat it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll give you a dinner, Georgey,''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>repeated Robert--<div class="bookquote">``some stewed eels, a little Julienne, a dish of cutlets, a bird, and a pudding. What do you say to that, Georgey?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think the young gentleman will object to it when he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) sees it, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>the waiter</b></font>)</div>said the waiter. <div class="bookquote">``Eels, Julienne, cutlets, bird, pudding--I'll go and tell the cook, sir. What time, sir?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, we'll say six, and Master Georgey will get to his (<font color='blue'><b>Georgey</b></font>) new school by bedtime. You can contrive to amuse the child for this afternoon, I dare say. I have some business to settle, and sha'n't be able to take him (<font color='blue'><b>Georgey</b></font>) out. I shall sleep here to-night. Good-by, Georgey; take care of yourself and try and get your appetite in order against six o'clock.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div><p/>Robert Audley left the boy in charge of the idle waiter, and strolled down to the water side, choosing that lonely bank which leads away under the moldering walls of the town toward the little villages beside the narrowing river.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) had purposely avoided the society of the child, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) walked through the light drifting snow till the early darkness closed upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>).

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) went back to the town, and made inquiries at the station about the trains for Dorsetshire.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall start early to-morrow morning,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) thought, <div class="bookquote">``and see George's father before nightfall. I will tell him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) all--all but the interest which I take in--in the suspected person, and he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) shall decide what is next to be done.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Master Georgey did very good justice to the dinner which Robert had ordered. He (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) drank Bass' pale ale to an extent which considerably alarmed his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) entertainer, and enjoyed himself amazingly, showing an appreciation of roast pheasant and bread-sauce which was beyond his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) years. At eight o'clock a fly was brought out for his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) accommodation, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) departed in the highest spirits, with a sovereign in his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) pocket, and a letter from Robert to Mr. Marchmont, inclosing a check for the young gentleman's outfit.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm glad I'm going to have new clothes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) said, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) bade Robert good-by; <div class="bookquote">``for Mrs. Plowson has mended the old ones ever so many times. She (<font color='blue'><b>Plowson</b></font>) can have them now, for Billy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who's Billy?''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>Robert asked, laughing at the boy's chatter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Billy is poor Matilda's little boy. He (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>)'s a common boy, you know. Matilda was common, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Matilda</b></font>)--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div><p/>But the flyman snapping his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) whip at this moment, the old horse jogged off, and Robert Audley heard no more of Matilda.

<p/>CHAPTER XXII.

<p/>COMING TO A STANDSTILL.

<p/>Mr. Harcourt Talboys lived in a prim, square, red-brick mansion, within a mile of a little village called Grange Heath, in Dorsetshire. The prim, square, red-brick mansion stood in the center of prim, square grounds, scarcely large enough to be called a park, too large to be called anything else--so neither the house nor the grounds had any name, and the estate was simply designated Squire Talboys'.

<p/>Perhaps Mr. Harcourt Talboys was the last person in this world with whom it was possible to associate the homely, hearty, rural old English title of squire. He (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) neither hunted nor farmed. He (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) had never worn crimson, pink, or top-boots in his (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) life. A southerly wind and a cloudy sky were matters of supreme indifference to him (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>), so long as they did not in any way interfere with his (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) own prim comforts; and he (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) only cared for the state of the crops inasmuch as it involved the hazard of certain rents which he (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) received for the farms upon his (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) estate. He (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) was a man of about fifty years of age, tall, straight, bony and angular, with a square, pale face, light gray eyes, and scanty dark hair, brushed from either ear across a bald crown, and thus imparting to his (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) physiognomy some faint resemblance to that of a terrier--a sharp, uncompromising, hard-headed terrier--a terrier not to be taken in by the cleverest dog-stealer who ever distinguished himself in his (<font color='blue'><b>terrier</b></font>) profession.

<p/>Nobody ever remembered getting upon what is popularly called the blind side of Harcourt Talboys. He (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) was like his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) own square-built, northern-fronted, shelterless house. There were no shady nooks in his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) character into which one could creep for shelter from his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) hard daylight. He (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) was all daylight. He (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) looked at everything in the same broad glare of intellectual sunlight, and would see no softening shadows that might alter the sharp outlines of cruel facts, subduing them to beauty. I do not know if I express what I mean, when I say that there were no curves in his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) character--that his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) mind ran in straight lines, never diverging to the right or the left to round off their pitiless angles. With him (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) right was right, and wrong was wrong. He (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) had never in his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) merciless, conscientious life admitted the idea that circumstances might mitigate the blackness of wrong or weaken the force of right. He (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) had cast off his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) only son because his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) only son had disobeyed him (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) was ready to cast off his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) only daughter at five minutes' notice for the same reason.

<p/>If this square-built, hard-headed man could be possessed of such a weakness as vanity, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was certainly vain of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hardness. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was vain of that inflexible squareness of intellect, which made him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) the disagreeable creature that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was vain of that unwavering obstinacy which no influence of love or pity had ever been known to bend from its remorseless purpose. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was vain of the negative force of a nature which had never known the weakness of the affections, or the strength which may be born of that very weakness.

<p/>If he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had regretted his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) son's marriage, and the breach of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own making, between himself and George, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) vanity had been more powerful than his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) regret, and had enabled him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to conceal it. Indeed, unlikely as it appears at the first glance that such a man as this could have been vain, I have little doubt that vanity was the center from which radiated all the disagreeable lines in the character of Mr. Harcourt Talboys. I dare say Junius Brutus was vain, and enjoyed the approval of awe-stricken Rome when he (<font color='blue'><b>Brutus</b></font>) ordered his (<font color='blue'><b>Brutus</b></font>) son off for execution. Harcourt Talboys would have sent poor George from his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) presence between the reversed fasces of the lictors, and grimly relished his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) own agony. Heaven only knows how bitterly this hard man may have felt the separation between himself and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) only son, or how much the more terrible the anguish might have been made by that unflinching self-conceit which concealed the torture.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My son did me an unpardonable wrong by marrying the daughter of a drunken pauper,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/George Talboys/Mr. Talboys</b></font>)</div>Mr. Talboys would answer to any one who had the temerity to speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) about George, <div class="bookquote">``and from that hour I had no longer a son. I wish him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) no ill. He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) is simply dead to me. I am sorry for him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>), as I am sorry for his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) mother who died nineteen years ago. If you talk to me of him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) as you would talk of the dead, I shall be ready to hear you. If you speak of him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) as you would speak of the living, I must decline to listen.''

 (<font color='red'><b>George/George Talboys/Mr. Talboys</b></font>)</div><p/>I believe that Harcourt Talboys hugged himself upon the gloomy Roman grandeur of this speech, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) would like to have worn a toga, and wrapped himself sternly in its folds, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) back upon poor George's intercessor. George never in his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) own person made any effort to soften his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) father's verdict. He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) knew his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) father well enough to know that the case was hopeless.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If I write to him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) will fold my letter with the envelope inside, and indorse it with my name and the date of its arrival,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>the young man would say, <div class="bookquote">``and call everybody in the house to witness that it had not moved him (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) to one softening recollection or one pitiful thought. He (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) will stick to his (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) resolution to his (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) dying day. I dare say, if the truth was known, he (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) is glad that his (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) only son has offended him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) and given him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) the opportunity of parading his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) Roman virtues.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/>George had answered his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) wife thus when she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) father had urged him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) to ask assistance from Harcourt Talboys.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No my darling,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) would say, conclusively. <div class="bookquote">``It's very hard, perhaps, to be poor, but we will bear it. We won't go with pitiful faces to the stern father, and ask him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) to give us food and shelter, only to be refused in long, Johnsonian sentences, and made a classical example for the benefit of the neighborhood. No, my pretty one; it is easy to starve, but it is difficult to stoop.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Talboys/Mrs. George Talboys/Mrs. George</b></font>)</div><p/>Perhaps poor Mrs. George did not agree very heartily to the first of these two propositions. She (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) had no great fancy for starving, and she (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) whimpered pitifully when the pretty pint bottles of champagne, with Cliquot's and Moet's brands upon their corks, were exchanged for sixpenny ale, procured by a slipshod attendant from the nearest beer-shop. George had been obliged to carry his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) own burden and lend a helping hand with that of his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) wife, who had no idea of keeping her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) regrets or disappointments a secret.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought dragoons were always rich,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) used to say, peevishly. <div class="bookquote">``Girls always want to marry dragoons; and tradespeople always want to serve dragoons; and hotel-keepers to entertain dragoons; and theatrical managers to be patronized by dragoons. Who could have ever expected that a dragoon would drink sixpenny ale, smoke horrid bird's-eye tobacco, and let his (<font color='blue'><b>dragoons</b></font>) wife wear a shabby bonnet?''

 (<font color='red'><b>George/George Talboys/Mr. Talboys</b></font>)</div><p/>If there were any selfish feelings displayed in such speeches as these, George Talboys had never discovered it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) had loved and believed in his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) wife from the first to the last hour of his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) brief married life. The love that is not blind is perhaps only a spurious divinity after all; for when Cupid takes the fillet from his (<font color='blue'><b>Cupid</b></font>) eyes it is a fatally certain indication that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cupid</b></font>) is preparing to spread his (<font color='blue'><b>Cupid</b></font>) wings for a flight. George never forgot the hour in which he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) had first become bewitched by Lieutenant Maldon's pretty daughter, and however she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) might have changed, the image which had charmed him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) then, unchanged and unchanging, represented her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) heart.

<p/>Robert Audley left Southampton by a train which started before daybreak, and reached Wareham station early in the day. He (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) hired a vehicle at Wareham to take him (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) over to Grange Heath.

<p/>The snow had hardened upon the ground, and the day was clear and frosty, every object in the landscape standing in sharp outline against the cold blue sky. The horses' hoofs clattered upon the ice-bound road, the iron shoes striking on the ground that was almost as iron as themselves. The wintry day bore some resemblance to the man to whom Robert was going. Like him (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>), it was sharp, frigid, and uncompromising: like him (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>), it was merciless to distress and impregnable to the softening power of sunshine. It would accept no sunshine but such January radiance as would light up the bleak, bare country without brightening it; and thus resembled Harcourt Talboys, who took the sternest side of every truth, and declared loudly to the disbelieving world that there never had been, and never could be, any other side.

<p/>Robert Audley's heart sunk within him (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) as the shabby hired vehicle stopped at a stern-looking barred fence, and the driver dismounted to open a broad iron gate which swung back with a clanking noise and was caught by a great iron tooth, planted in the ground, which snapped at the lowest bar of the gate as if it wanted to bite.

<p/>This iron gate opened into a scanty plantation of straight-limbed fir-trees, that grew in rows and shook their sturdy winter foliage defiantly in the very teeth of the frosty breeze. A straight graveled carriage-drive ran between these straight trees across a smoothly kept lawn to a square red-brick mansion, every window of which winked and glittered in the January sunlight as if it had been that moment cleaned by some indefatigable housemaid.

<p/>I don't know whether Junius Brutus was a nuisance in his (<font color='blue'><b>Brutus</b></font>) own house, but among other of his (<font color='blue'><b>Brutus</b></font>) Roman virtues, Mr. Talboys owned an extreme aversion to disorder, and was the terror of every domestic in his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) establishment.

<p/>The windows winked and the flight of stone steps glared in the sunlight, the prim garden walks were so freshly graveled that they gave a sandy, gingery aspect to the place, reminding one unpleasantly of red hair. The lawn was chiefly ornamented with dark, wintry shrubs of a funereal aspect which grew in beds that looked like problems in algebra; and the flight of stone steps leading to the square half-glass door of the hall was adorned with dark-green wooden tubs containing the same sturdy evergreens.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If the man is anything like his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) house,''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>Robert thought, <div class="bookquote">``I don't wonder that poor George and he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) parted.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div><p/>At the end of a scanty avenue the carriage-drive turned a sharp corner -LRB-it would have been made to describe a curve in any other man's grounds-RRB- and ran before the lower windows of the house. The flyman dismounted at the steps, ascended them, and rang a brass-handled bell, which flew back to its socket, with an angry, metallic snap, as if it had been insulted by the plebeian touch of the man's hand.

<p/>A man in black trousers and a striped linen jacket, which was evidently fresh from the hands of the laundress, opened the door. Mr. Talboys was at home. Would the gentleman send in his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) card?

<p/>Robert waited in the hall while his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) card was taken to the master of the house.

<p/>The hall was large and lofty, paved with stone. The panels of the oaken wainscot shone with the same uncompromising polish which was on every object within and without the red-bricked mansion.

<p/>Some people are so weak-minded as to affect pictures and statues. Mr. Harcourt Talboys was far too practical to indulge in any foolish fancies. A barometer and an umbrella-stand were the only adornments of his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) entrance-hall.

<p/>Robert Audley looked at these while his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) name was being submitted to George's father.

<p/>The linen-jacketed servant returned presently. He (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) was a square, pale-faced man of almost forty, and had the appearance of having outlived every emotion to which humanity is subject.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you will step this way, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Talboys will see you, although he (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) is at breakfast. He (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) begged me to state that everybody in Dorsetshire was acquainted with his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) breakfast hour.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>This was intended as a stately reproof to Mr. Robert Audley. It had, however, very small effect upon the young barrister. He (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) merely lifted his (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) eyebrows in placid deprecation of himself and everybody else.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't belong to Dorsetshire,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Talboys might have known that, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>)'d done me the honor to exercise his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) powers of ratiocination. Drive on, my friend.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div><p/>The emotionless man looked at Robert Audley with a vacant stare of unmitigated horror, and opening one of the heavy oak doors, led the way into a large dining-room furnished with the severe simplicity of an apartment which is meant to be ate in, but never lived in; and at top of a table which would have accommodated eighteen persons Robert beheld Mr. Harcourt Talboys.

<p/>Mr. Talboys was robed in a dressing-gown of gray cloth, fastened about his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) waist with a girdle. It was a severe looking garment, and was perhaps the nearest approach to the toga to be obtained within the range of modern costume. He (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) wore a buff waistcoat, a stiffly starched cambric cravat, and a faultless shirt collar. The cold gray of his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) dressing gown was almost the same as the cold gray of his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) eyes, and the pale buff of his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) waistcoat was the pale buff of his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) complexion.

<p/>Robert Audley had not expected to find Harcourt Talboys at all like George in his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) manners or disposition, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) had expected to see some family likeness between the father and the son. There was none. It would have been impossible to imagine any one more unlike George than the author of his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) existence. Robert scarcely wondered at the cruel letter he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) received from Mr. Talboys when he (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) saw the writer of it. Such a man could scarcely have written otherwise.

<p/>There was a second person in the large room, toward whom Robert glanced after saluting Harcourt Talboys, doubtful how to proceed. This second person was a lady, who sat at the last of a range of four windows, employed with some needlework, the kind which is generally called plain work, and with a large wicker basket, filled with calicoes and flannels, standing by her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>).

<p/>The whole length of the room divided this lady from Robert, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) could see that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was young, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was like George Talboys.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``His (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) sister!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) thought in that one moment, during which he (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) ventured to glance away from the master of the house toward the female figure at the window. <div class="bookquote">``His (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) sister, no doubt. He (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) was fond of her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>), I know. Surely, she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) is not utterly indifferent as to his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) fate?''

 (<font color='red'><b>lady</b></font>)</div><p/>The lady half rose from her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) seat, letting her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) work, which was large and awkward, fall from her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) lap as she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) did so, and dropping a reel of cotton, which rolled away upon the polished oaken flooring beyond the margin of the Turkey carpet.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sit down, Clara,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/George Talboys/Mr. Talboys</b></font>)</div>said the hard voice of Mr. Talboys.

<p/>That gentleman did not appear to address his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) daughter, nor had his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) face been turned toward her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) when she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) rose. It seemed as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) had known it by some social magnetism peculiar to himself; it seemed, as his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) servants were apt disrespectfully to observe, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) had eyes in the back of his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) head.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sit down, Clara,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) repeated, <div class="bookquote">``and keep your cotton in your workbox.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The lady blushed at this reproof, and stooped to look for the cotton. Mr. Robert Audley, who was unabashed by the stern presence of the master of the house, knelt on the carpet, found the reel, and restored it to its owner; Harcourt Talboys staring at the proceeding with an expression of unmitigated astonishment.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps, Mr. ----, Mr. Robert Audley!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) said, looking at the card which he (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) held between his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) finger and thumb, <div class="bookquote">``perhaps when you have finished looking for reels of cotton, you will be good enough to tell me to what I owe the honor of this visit?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) waved his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) well-shaped hand with a gesture which might have been admired in the stately John Kemble; and the servant, understanding the gesture, brought forward a ponderous red-morocco chair.

<p/>The proceeding was so slow and solemn, that Robert had at first thought that something extraordinary was about to be done; but the truth dawned upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) at last, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) dropped into the massive chair.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You may remain, Wilson,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/George Talboys/Mr. Talboys</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Talboys, as the servant was about to withdraw; <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Audley would perhaps like coffee.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the servant</b></font>)</div><p/>Robert had eaten nothing that morning, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) glanced at the long expanse of dreary table-cloth, the silver tea and coffee equipage, the stiff splendor, and the very little appearance of any substantial entertainment, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) declined Mr. Talboys' invitation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Audley will not take coffee, Wilson,''  (<font color='red'><b>the master</b></font>)</div>said the master of the house. <div class="bookquote">``You may go.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div><p/>The man bowed and retired, opening and shutting the door as cautiously as if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) were taking a liberty in doing it at all, or as if the respect due to Mr. Talboys demanded his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) walking straight through the oaken panel like a ghost in a German story.

<p/>Mr. Harcourt Talboys sat with his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) gray eyes fixed severely on his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) visitor, his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) elbows on the red-morocco arms of his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) chair, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) finger-tips joined. It was the attitude in which, had he (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) been Junius Brutus, he (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) would have sat at the trial of his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) son. Had Robert Audley been easily to be embarrassed, Mr. Talboys might have succeeded in making him (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) feel so: as he (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) would have sat with perfect tranquility upon an open gunpowder barrel lighting his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) cigar, he (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) was not at all disturbed upon this occasion. The father's dignity seemed a very small thing to him (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) thought of the possible causes of the son's disappearance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wrote to you some time since, Mr. Talboys,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) said quietly, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) saw that he (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) was expected to open the conversation.

<p/>Harcourt Talboys bowed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) knew that it was of his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) lost son that Robert came to speak. Heaven grant that his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) icy stoicism was the paltry affectation of a vain man, rather than the utter heartlessness which Robert thought it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) bowed across his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) finger-tips at his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) visitor. The trial had begun, and Junius Brutus was enjoying himself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I received your communication, Mr. Audley,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Brutus</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``It is among other business letters: it was duly answered.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That letter concerned your son.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div><p/>There was a little rustling noise at the window where the lady sat, as Robert said this: he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) almost instantaneously, but she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) did not seem to have stirred. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was not working, but she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was perfectly quiet.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>)'s as heartless as her (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) father, I expect, though she (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) is like George,''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>thought Mr. Audley.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If your letter concerned the person who was once my son, perhaps, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harcourt Talboys/Mr. Harcourt Talboys</b></font>)</div>said Harcourt Talboys, <div class="bookquote">``I must ask you to remember that I have no longer a son.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harcourt Talboys/Mr. Harcourt Talboys</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You have no reason to remind me of that, Mr. Talboys,''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>answered Robert, gravely; <div class="bookquote">``I remember it only too well. I have fatal reason to believe that you have no longer a son. I have bitter cause to think that he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) is dead.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div><p/>It may be that Mr. Talboys' complexion faded to a paler shade of buff as Robert said this; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) only elevated his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) bristling gray eyebrows and shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) head gently.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``no, I assure you, no.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I believe that George Talboys died in the month of September.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The girl hands</b></font>)</div><p/>The girl who had been addressed as Clara, sat with work primly folded upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) lap, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) hands lying clasped together on her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) work, and never stirred when Robert spoke of his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) friend's death. He (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) could not distinctly see her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) face, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) was seated at some distance from him (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>), and with her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) back to the window.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no, I assure you,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/George Talboys/Mr. Talboys</b></font>)</div>repeated Mr. Talboys, <div class="bookquote">``you labor under a sad mistake.''

 (<font color='red'><b>George/George Talboys/Mr. Talboys</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You believe that I am mistaken in thinking your son dead?''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>asked Robert.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Most certainly,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/George Talboys/Mr. Talboys</b></font>)</div>replied Mr. Talboys, with a smile, expressive of the serenity of wisdom. <div class="bookquote">``Most certainly, my dear sir. The disappearance was a very clever trick, no doubt, but it was not sufficiently clever to deceive me. You must permit me to understand this matter a little better than you, Mr. Audley, and you must also permit me to assure you of three things. In the first place, your friend is not dead. In the second place, he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) is keeping out of the way for the purpose of alarming me, of trifling with my feelings as a--as a man who was once his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) father, and of ultimately obtaining my forgiveness. In the third place, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) will not obtain that forgiveness, however long he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) may please to keep out of the way; and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would therefore act wisely by returning to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ordinary residence and avocations without delay.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then you imagine him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to purposely hide himself from all who know him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), for the purpose of--''

 (<font color='red'><b>George/George Talboys/Mr. Talboys</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``For the purpose of influencing me,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/George Talboys/Mr. Talboys</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Mr. Talboys, who, taking a stand upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) own vanity, traced every event in life from that one center, and resolutely declined to look at it from any other point of view. <div class="bookquote">``For the purpose of influencing me. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knew the inflexibility of my character; to a certain degree he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was acquainted with me, and knew that all attempts at softening my decision, or moving me from the fixed purpose of my life, would fail. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) therefore tried extraordinary means; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has kept out of the way in order to alarm me, and when after due time he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) discovers that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has not alarmed me, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) will return to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) old haunts. When he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) does so,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/George Talboys/Mr. Talboys</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Talboys, rising to sublimity, <div class="bookquote">``I will forgive him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). Yes, sir, I will forgive him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). I shall say to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>): You have attempted to deceive me, and I have shown you that I am not to be deceived; you have tried to frighten me, and I have convinced you that I am not to be frightened; you did not believe in my generosity, I will show you that I can be generous.''

 (<font color='red'><b>George/George Talboys/Mr. Talboys</b></font>)</div><p/>Harcourt Talboys delivered himself of these superb periods with a studied manner, that showed they had been carefully composed long ago.

<p/>Robert Audley sighed as he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) heard them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Heaven grant that you may have an opportunity of saying this to your son, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) answered sadly. <div class="bookquote">``I am very glad to find that you are willing to forgive him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>), but I fear that you will never see him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) again upon this earth. I have a great deal to say to you upon this--this sad subject, Mr. Talboys; but I would rather say it to you alone,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) added, glancing at the lady in the window.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My daughter knows my ideas upon this subject, Mr. Audley,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harcourt Talboys/Mr. Harcourt Talboys</b></font>)</div>said Harcourt Talboys; <div class="bookquote">``there is no reason why she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) should not hear all you have to say. Miss Clara Talboys, Mr. Robert Audley,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harcourt Talboys/Mr. Harcourt Talboys</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) added, waving his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) hand majestically.

<p/>The young lady bent her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) head in recognition of Robert's bow.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) hear it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) thought. <div class="bookquote">``If she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) has so little feeling as to show no emotion upon such a subject, let her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) hear the worst I have to tell.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div><p/>There was a few minutes' pause, during which Robert took some papers from his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) pocket; among them the document which he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) had written immediately after George's disappearance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall require all your attention, Mr. Talboys,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``for that which I have to disclose to you is of a very painful nature. Your son was my very dear friend--dear to me for many reasons. Perhaps most of all dear, because I had known him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) and been with him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) through the great trouble of his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) life; and because he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) stood comparatively alone in the world--cast off by you who should have been his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) best friend, bereft of the only woman he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) had ever loved.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The daughter of a drunken pauper,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/George Talboys/Mr. Talboys</b></font>)</div>Mr. Talboys remarked, parenthetically.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Had he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) died in his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) bed, as I sometimes thought he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) would,''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>continued Robert Audley, <div class="bookquote">``of a broken heart, I should have mourned for him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) very sincerely, even though I had closed his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) eyes with my own hands, and had seen him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) laid in his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) quiet resting-place. I should have grieved for my old schoolfellow, and for the companion who had been dear to me. But this grief would have been a very small one compared to that which I feel now, believing, as I do only too firmly, that my poor friend has been murdered.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Murdered!''

 (<font color='red'><b>The father daughter</b></font>)</div><p/>The father and daughter simultaneously repeated the horrible word. The father's face changed to a ghastly duskiness of hue; the daughter's face dropped upon her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) clasped hands, and was never lifted again throughout the interview.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Audley, you are mad!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harcourt Talboys/Mr. Harcourt Talboys</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Harcourt Talboys; <div class="bookquote">``you are mad, or else you are commissioned by your friend to play upon my feelings. I protest against this proceeding as a conspiracy, and I--I revoke my intended forgiveness of the person who was once my son!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harcourt Talboys/Mr. Harcourt Talboys</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) was himself again as he (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) said this. The blow had been a sharp one, but its effect had been momentary.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is far from my wish to alarm you unnecessarily, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>answered Robert. <div class="bookquote">``Heaven grant that you may be right and I wrong. I pray for it, but I cannot think it--I cannot even hope it. I come to you for advice. I will state to you plainly and dispassionately the circumstances which have aroused my suspicions. If you say those suspicions are foolish and unfounded I am ready to submit to your better judgment. I will leave England; and I abandon my search for the evidence wanting to--to confirm my fears. If you say go on, I will go on.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harcourt Talboys/Mr. Harcourt Talboys</b></font>)</div><p/>Nothing could be more gratifying to the vanity of Mr. Harcourt Talboys than this appeal. He (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) declared himself ready to listen to all that Robert might have to say, and ready to assist him (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) to the uttermost of his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) power.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) laid some stress upon this last assurance, deprecating the value of his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) advice with an affectation that was as transparent as his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) vanity itself.

<p/>Robert Audley drew his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) chair nearer to that of Mr. Talboys, and commenced a minutely detailed account of all that had occurred to George from the time of his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) arrival in England to the hour of his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) disappearance, as well as all that had occurred since his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) disappearance in any way touching upon that particular subject. Harcourt Talboys listened with demonstrative attention, now and then interrupting the speaker to ask some magisterial kind of question. Clara Talboys never once lifted her (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) face from her (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) clasped hands.

<p/>The hands of the clock pointed to a quarter past eleven when Robert began his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) story. The clock struck twelve as he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) finished.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) had carefully suppressed the names of his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) uncle and his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) uncle's wife in relating the circumstances in which they had been concerned.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) said, when the story had been told, <div class="bookquote">``I await your decision. You have heard my reasons for coming to this terrible conclusion. In what manner do these reasons influence you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They don't in any way turn me from my previous opinion,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harcourt Talboys/Mr. Harcourt Talboys</b></font>)</div>answered Mr. Harcourt Talboys, with the unreasoning pride of an obstinate man. <div class="bookquote">``I still think, as I thought before, that my son is alive, and that his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) disappearance is a conspiracy against myself. I decline to become the victim of that conspiracy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you tell me to stop?''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>asked Robert, solemnly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I tell you only this: If you go on, you go on for your own satisfaction, not for mine. I see nothing in what you have told me to alarm me for the safety of--your friend.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So be it, then!''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Robert, suddenly; <div class="bookquote">``from this moment I wash my hands of this business. From this moment the purpose of my life shall be to forget it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) rose as he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) spoke, and took his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) hat from the table on which he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) had placed it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) looked at Clara Talboys. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) attitude had never changed since she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) had dropped her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) face upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) hands. <div class="bookquote">``Good morning, Mr. Talboys,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) said, gravely. <div class="bookquote">``God grant that you are right. God grant that I am wrong. But I fear a day will come when you will have reason to regret your apathy respecting the untimely fate of your only son.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) bowed gravely to Mr. Harcourt Talboys and to the lady, whose face was hidden by her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) hands.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) lingered for a moment looking at Miss Talboys, thinking that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) would look up, that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) would make some sign, or show some desire to detain him (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>).

<p/>Mr. Talboys rang for the emotionless servant, who led Robert off to the hall-door with the solemnity of manner which would have been in perfect keeping had he (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) been leading him (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) to execution.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) is like her (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) father,''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>thought Mr. Audley, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) glanced for the last time at the drooping head. <div class="bookquote">``Poor George, you had need of one friend in this world, for you have had very few to love you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER XXIII.

<p/>CLARA.

<p/>Robert Audley found the driver asleep upon the box of his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) lumbering vehicle. He (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) had been entertained with beer of so hard a nature as to induce temporary strangulation in the daring imbiber thereof, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) was very glad to welcome the return of his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) fare. The old white horse, who looked as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) had been foaled in the year in which the carriage had been built, and seemed, like the carriage, to have outlived the fashion, was as fast asleep as his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) master, and woke up with a jerk as Robert came down the stony flight of steps, attended by his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) executioner, who waited respectfully till Mr. Audley had entered the vehicle and been turned off.

<p/>The horse, roused by a smack of his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) driver's whip and a shake of the shabby reins, crawled off in a semi-somnambulent state; and Robert, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) hat very much over his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) eyes, thought of his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) missing friend.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) had played in these stiff gardens, and under these dreary firs, years ago, perhaps--if it were possible for the most frolicsome youth to be playful within the range of Mr. Harcourt Talboys' hard gray eyes. He (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) had played beneath these dark trees, perhaps, with the sister who had heard of his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) fate to-day without a tear. Robert Audley looked at the rigid primness of the orderly grounds, wondering how George could have grown up in such a place to be the frank, generous, careless friend whom he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had known. How was it that with his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) father perpetually before his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) eyes, he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had not grown up after the father's disagreeable model, to be a nuisance to his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) fellow-men? How was it? Because we have Some One higher than our parents to thank for the souls which make us great or small; and because, while family noses and family chins may descend in orderly sequence from father to son, from grandsire to grandchild, as the fashion of the fading flowers of one year is reproduced in the budding blossoms of the next, the spirit, more subtle than the wind which blows among those flowers, independent of all earthly rule, owns no order but the harmonious law of God.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank God!''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>thought Robert Audley; <div class="bookquote">``thank God! it is over. My poor friend must rest in his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) unknown grave; and I shall not be the means of bringing disgrace upon those I love. It will come, perhaps, sooner or later, but it will not come through me. The crisis is past, and I am free.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) felt an unutterable relief in this thought. His (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) generous nature revolted at the office into which he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) had found himself drawn--the office of spy, the collector of damning facts that led on to horrible deductions.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) drew a long breath--a sigh of relief at his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) release. It was all over now.

<p/>The fly was crawling out of the gate of the plantation as he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) thought this, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) stood up in the vehicle to look back at the dreary fir-trees, the gravel paths, the smooth grass, and the great desolate-looking, red-brick mansion.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) was startled by the appearance of a woman running, almost flying, along the carriage-drive by which he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) had come, and waving a handkerchief in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) uplifted hand.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) stared at this singular apparition for some moments in silent wonder before he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) was able to reduce his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) stupefaction into words.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it me the flying female wants?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) exclaimed, at last. <div class="bookquote">``You'd better stop, perhaps,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) added, to the flyman. <div class="bookquote">``It is an age of eccentricity, an abnormal era of the world's history. She (<font color='blue'><b>female</b></font>) may want me. Very likely I left my pocket-handkerchief behind me, and Mr. Talboys has sent this person with it. Perhaps I'd better get out and go and meet her (<font color='blue'><b>female</b></font>). It's civil to send my handkerchief.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Robert Audley deliberately descended from the fly and walked slowly toward the hurrying female figure, which gained upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) rapidly.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) was rather short sighted, and it was not until she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) came very near to him (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) saw who she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good Heaven!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) exclaimed, <div class="bookquote">``it's Miss Talboys.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>It was Miss Talboys, flushed and breathless, with a woolen shawl thrown over her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) head.

<p/>Robert Audley now saw her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) face clearly for the first time, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) saw that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was very handsome. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had brown eyes, like George's, a pale complexion -LRB-she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had been flushed when she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) approached him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>), but the color faded away as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) recovered her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) breath-RRB-, regular features, with a mobility of expression which bore record of every change of feeling. He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) saw all this in a few moments, and he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) wondered only the more at the stoicism of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) manner during his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) interview with Mr. Talboys. There were no tears in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) eyes, but they were bright with a feverish luster--terribly bright and dry--and he (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) could see that her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) lips trembled as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) spoke to him (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Talboys,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``what can I--why--''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) interrupted him (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) suddenly, catching at his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) wrist with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) disengaged hand--she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was holding her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) shawl in the other.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, let me speak to you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) cried--<div class="bookquote">``let me speak to you, or I shall go mad. I heard it all. I believe what you believe, and I shall go mad unless I can do something--something toward avenging his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) death.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>For a few moments Robert Audley was too much bewildered to answer her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). Of all things possible upon earth he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) had least expected to behold her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) thus.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Take my arm, Miss Talboys,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Pray calm yourself. Let us walk a little way back toward the house, and talk quietly. I would not have spoken as I did before you had I known--''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Had you known that I loved my brother?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said, quickly. <div class="bookquote">``How should you know that I loved him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)? How should any one think that I loved him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>), when I have never had power to give him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) a welcome beneath that roof, or a kindly word from his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) father? How should I dare to betray my love for him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) in that house when I knew that even a sister's affection would be turned to his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) disadvantage? You do not know my father, Mr. Audley. I do. I knew that to intercede for George would have been to ruin his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) cause. I knew that to leave matters in my father's hands, and to trust to time, was my only chance of ever seeing that dear brother again. And I waited--waited patiently, always hoping for the best; for I knew that my father loved his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) only son. I see your contemptuous smile, Mr. Audley, and I dare say it is difficult for a stranger to believe that underneath his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) affected stoicism my father conceals some degree of affection for his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) children--no very warm attachment perhaps, for he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) has always ruled his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) life by the strict law of duty. Stop,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said, suddenly, laying her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hand upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) arm, and looking back through the straight avenue of pines; <div class="bookquote">``I ran out of the house by the back way. Papa must not see me talking to you, Mr. Audley, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) must not see the fly standing at the gate. Will you go into the high-road and tell the man to drive on a little way? I will come out of the plantation by a little gate further on, and meet you in the road.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you will catch cold, Miss Talboys,''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>remonstrated Robert, looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) anxiously, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) saw that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was trembling. <div class="bookquote">``You are shivering now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not with cold,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) answered. <div class="bookquote">``I am thinking of my brother George. If you have any pity for the only sister of your lost friend, do what I ask you, Mr. Audley. I must speak to you--I must speak to you--calmly, if I can.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) put her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hand to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) head as if trying to collect her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) thoughts, and then pointed to the gate. Robert bowed and left her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) told the man to drive slowly toward the station, and walked on by the side of the tarred fence surrounding Mr. Talboys' grounds. About a hundred yards beyond the principal entrance he (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) came to a little wooden gate in the fence, and waited at it for Miss Talboys.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) joined him (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) presently, with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) shawl still over her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) head, and her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) eyes still bright and tearless.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Will you walk with me inside the plantation?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``We might be observed on the high-road.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) bowed, passed through the gate, and shut it behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>).

<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) offered arm he (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) found that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was still trembling--trembling very violently.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Pray, pray calm yourself, Miss Talboys,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``I may have been deceived in the opinion which I have formed; I may--''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no, no,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) exclaimed, <div class="bookquote">``you are not deceived. My brother has been murdered. Tell me the name of that woman--the woman whom you suspect of being concerned in his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) disappearance--in his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) murder.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That I cannot do until--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Until when?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Until I know that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is guilty.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You told my father that you would abandon all idea of discovering the truth--that you would rest satisfied to leave my brother's fate a horrible mystery never to be solved upon this earth; but you will not do so, Mr. Audley--you will not be false to the memory of your friend. You will see vengeance done upon those who have destroyed him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>). You will do this, will you not?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div><p/>A gloomy shadow spread itself like a dark veil over Robert Audley's handsome face.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) remembered what he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) had said the day before at Southampton:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A hand that is stronger than my own is beckoning me onward, upon the dark road.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>A quarter of an hour before, he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) had believed that all was over, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) was released from the dreadful duty of discovering the secret of George's death. Now this girl, this apparently passionless girl, had found a voice, and was urging him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) on toward his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) fate.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you knew what misery to me may be involved in discovering the truth, Miss Talboys,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``you would scarcely ask me to pursue this business any farther?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I do ask you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) answered, with suppressed passion--<div class="bookquote">``I do ask you. I ask you to avenge my brother's untimely death. Will you do so? Yes or no?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What if I answer no?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then I will do it myself,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) exclaimed, looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) bright brown eyes. <div class="bookquote">``I myself will follow up the clew to this mystery; I will find this woman--though you refuse to tell me in what part of England my brother disappeared. I will travel from one end of the world to the other to find the secret of his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) fate, if you refuse to find it for me. I am of age; my own mistress; rich, for I have money left me by one of my aunts; I shall be able to employ those who will help me in my search, and I will make it to their interest to serve me well. Choose between the two alternatives, Mr. Audley. Shall you or I find my brother's murderer?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) looked in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) face, and saw that her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) resolution was the fruit of no transient womanish enthusiasm which would give way under the iron hand of difficulty. Her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) beautiful features, naturally statuesque in their noble outlines, seemed transformed into marble by the rigidity of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) expression. The face in which he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) looked was the face of a woman whom death only could turn from her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) purpose.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have grown up in an atmosphere of suppression,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said, quietly; <div class="bookquote">``I have stifled and dwarfed the natural feelings of my heart, until they have become unnatural in their intensity; I have been allowed neither friends nor lovers. My mother died when I was very young. My father has always been to me what you saw him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) to-day. I have had no one but my brother. All the love that my heart can hold has been centered upon him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>). Do you wonder, then, that when I hear that his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) young life has been ended by the hand of treachery, that I wish to see vengeance done upon the traitor? Oh, my God,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) cried, suddenly clasping her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hands, and looking up at the cold winter sky, <div class="bookquote">``lead me to the murderer of my brother, and let mine be the hand to avenge his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) untimely death.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Robert Audley stood looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) with awe-stricken admiration. Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) beauty was elevated into sublimity by the intensity of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) suppressed passion. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was different to all other women that he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) had ever seen. His (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) cousin was pretty, his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) uncle's wife was lovely, but Clara Talboys was beautiful. Niobe's face, sublimated by sorrow, could scarcely have been more purely classical than hers. Even her (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) dress, puritan in its gray simplicity, became her (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) beauty better than a more beautiful dress would have become a less beautiful woman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Talboys,''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>said Robert, after a pause, <div class="bookquote">``your brother shall not be unavenged. He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) shall not be forgotten. I do not think that any professional aid which you could procure would lead you as surely to the secret of this mystery as I can lead you, if you are patient and trust me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will trust you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) answered, <div class="bookquote">``for I see that you will help me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I believe that it is my destiny to do so,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) said, solemnly.

<p/>In the whole course of his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) conversation with Harcourt Talboys, Robert Audley had carefully avoided making any deductions from the circumstances which he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) had submitted to George's father. He (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) had simply told the story of the missing man's life, from the hour of his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) arriving in London to that of his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) disappearance; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) saw that Clara Talboys had arrived at the same conclusion as himself, and that it was tacitly understood between them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you any letters of your brother's, Miss Talboys?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Two. One written soon after his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) marriage, the other written at Liverpool, the night before he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) sailed for Australia.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Will you let me see them?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I will send them to you if you will give me your address. You will write to me from time to time, will you not, to tell me whether you are approaching the truth. I shall be obliged to act secretly here, but I am going to leave home in two or three months, and I shall be perfectly free then to act as I please.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are not going to leave England?''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>Robert asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh no! I am only going to pay a long-promised visit to some friends in Essex.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div><p/>Robert started so violently as Clara Talboys said this, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) looked suddenly at his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) face. The agitation visible there, betrayed a part of his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) secret.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My brother George disappeared in Essex,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) said.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) could not contradict her (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sorry you have discovered so much,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) replied. <div class="bookquote">``My position becomes every day more complicated, every day more painful. Good-bye.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) hand mechanically, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) held out his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>); but it was cold as marble, and lay listlessly in his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) own, and fell like a log at her (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) side when he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) released it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Pray lose no time in returning to the house,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) said earnestly. <div class="bookquote">``I fear you will suffer from this morning's work.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Suffer!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) exclaimed, scornfully. <div class="bookquote">``You talk to me of suffering, when the only creature in this world who ever loved me has been taken from it in the bloom of youth. What can there be for me henceforth but suffering? What is the cold to me?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) said, flinging back her (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) shawl and baring her (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) beautiful head to the bitter wind. <div class="bookquote">``I would walk from here to London barefoot through the snow, and never stop by the way, if I could bring him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) back to life. What would I not do to bring him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) back? What would I not do?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The words broke from her (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) in a wail of passionate sorrow; and clasping her (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) hands before her (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) face, she (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) wept for the first time that day. The violence of her (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) sobs shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) slender frame, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) was obliged to lean against the trunk of a tree for support.

<p/>Robert looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) with a tender compassion in his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) face; she (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) was so like the friend whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) had loved and lost, that it was impossible for him (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) to think of her (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) as a stranger; impossible to remember that they had met that morning for the first time.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Pray, pray be calm,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) said: <div class="bookquote">``hope even against hope. We may both be deceived; your brother may still live.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! if it were so,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) murmured, passionately; <div class="bookquote">``if it could be so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Let us try and hope that it may be so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) answered, looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) through her (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) tears, <div class="bookquote">``let us hope for nothing but revenge. Good-by, Mr. Audley. Stop; your address.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) a card, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) put into the pocket of her (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) dress.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I will send you George's letters,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``they may help you. Good-by.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) left him (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) half bewildered by the passionate energy of her (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) manner, and the noble beauty of her (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) face. He (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) watched her (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) disappeared among the straight trunks of the fir-trees, and then walked slowly out of the plantation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Heaven help those who stand between me and the secret,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) thought, <div class="bookquote">``for they will be sacrificed to the memory of George Talboys.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER XXIV.

<p/>GEORGE``S LETTERS.

<p/>Robert Audley did not return to Southampton, but took a ticket for the first up town train that left Wareham, and reached Waterloo Bridge an hour or two after dark. The snow, which had been hard and crisp in Dorsetshire, was a black and greasy slush in the Waterloo Road, thawed by the flaring lamps of the gin-palaces and the glaring gas in the butchers' shops.

<p/>Robert Audley shrugged his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) shoulders as he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) looked at the dingy streets through which the Hansom carried him (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>), the cab-man choosing--with that delicious instinct which seems innate in the drivers of hackney vehicles--all those dark and hideous thoroughfares utterly unknown to the ordinary pedestrian.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What a pleasant thing life is,''  (<font color='red'><b>the barrister</b></font>)</div>thought the barrister. <div class="bookquote">``What an unspeakable boon--what an overpowering blessing! Let any man make a calculation of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) existence, subtracting the hours in which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has been thoroughly happy--really and entirely at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ease, without one arriere pensée to mar his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) enjoyment--without the most infinitesimal cloud to overshadow the brightness of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) horizon. Let him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) do this, and surely he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) will laugh in utter bitterness of soul when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sets down the sum of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) felicity, and discovers the pitiful smallness of the amount. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) will have enjoyed himself for a week or ten days in thirty years, perhaps. In thirty years of dull December, and blustering March, and showery April, and dark November weather, there may have been seven or eight glorious August days, through which the sun has blazed in cloudless radiance, and the summer breezes have breathed perpetual balm. How fondly we recollect these solitary days of pleasure, and hope for their recurrence, and try to plan the circumstances that made them bright; and arrange, and predestinate, and diplomatize with fate for a renewal of the remembered joy. As if any joy could ever be built up out of such and such constituent parts! As if happiness were not essentially accidental--a bright and wandering bird, utterly irregular in its migrations; with us one summer's day, and forever gone from us on the next! Look at marriages, for instance,''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>mused Robert, who was as meditative in the jolting vehicle, for whose occupation he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) was to pay sixpence a mile, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) had been riding a mustang on the wild loneliness of the prairies. ``Look at marriage! Who is to say which shall be the one judicious selection out of nine hundred and ninety-nine mistakes! Who shall decide from the first aspect of the slimy creature, which is to be the one eel out of the colossal bag of snakes? That girl on the curbstone yonder, waiting to cross the street when my chariot shall have passed, may be the one woman out of every female creature in this vast universe who could make me a happy man. Yet I pass her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) by--bespatter her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) with the mud from my wheels, in my helpless ignorance, in my blind submission to the awful hand of fatality. If that girl, Clara Talboys, had been five minutes later, I should have left Dorsetshire thinking her (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) cold, hard, and unwomanly, and should have gone to my grave with that mistake part and parcel of my mind. I took her (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) for a stately and heartless automaton; I know her (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) now to be a noble and beautiful woman. What an incalculable difference this may make in my life. When I left that house, I went out into the winter day with the determination of abandoning all further thought of the secret of George's death. I see her (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) forces me onward upon the loathsome path--the crooked by-way of watchfulness and suspicion. How can I say to this sister of my dead friend, <div class="bookquote">``I believe that your brother has been murdered! I believe that I know by whom, but I will take no step to set my doubts at rest, or to confirm my fears'? I cannot say this. This woman knows half my secret; she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) will soon possess herself of the rest, and then--and then--''

 (<font color='red'><b>the midst</b></font>)</div><p/>The cab stopped in the midst of Robert Audley's meditation, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) had to pay the cabman, and submit to all the dreary mechanism of life, which is the same whether we are glad or sorry--whether we are to be married or hung, elevated to the woolsack, or disbarred by our brother benchers on some mysterious technical tangle of wrong-doing, which is a social enigma to those outside the forum domesticum of the Middle Temple.

<p/>We are apt to be angry with this cruel hardness in our life--this unflinching regularity in the smaller wheels and meaner mechanism of the human machine, which knows no stoppage or cessation, though the mainspring be forever hollow, and the hands pointing to purposeless figures on a shattered dial.

<p/>Who has not felt, in the first madness of sorrow, an unreasoning rage against the mute propriety of chairs and tables, the stiff squareness of Turkey carpets, the unbending obstinacy of the outward apparatus of existence? We want to root up gigantic trees in a primeval forest, and to tear their huge branches asunder in our convulsive grasp; and the utmost that we can do for the relief of our passion is to knock over an easy-chair, or smash a few shillings' worth of Mr. Copeland's manufacture.

<p/>Madhouses are large and only too numerous; yet surely it is strange they are not larger, when we think of how many helpless wretches must beat their brains against this hopeless persistency of the orderly outward world, as compared with the storm and tempest, the riot and confusion within--when we remember how many minds must tremble upon the narrow boundary between reason and unreason, mad to-day and sane to-morrow, mad yesterday and sane to-day.

<p/>Robert Audley had directed the cabman to drop him (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) at the corner of Chancery Lane, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) ascended the brilliantly-lighted staircase leading to the dining-saloon of The London, and seated himself at one of the snug tables with a confused sense of emptiness and weariness, rather than any agreeable sensation of healthy hunger. He (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) had come to the luxurious eating-house to dine, because it was absolutely necessary to eat something somewhere, and a great deal easier to get a very good dinner from Mr. Sawyer than a very bad one from Mrs. Maloney, whose mind ran in one narrow channel of chops and steaks, only variable by small creeks and outlets in the way of <div class="bookquote">``broiled sole''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Maloney</b></font>)</div>or <div class="bookquote">``boiled mack'-rill.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Maloney</b></font>)</div>The solicitous waiter tried in vain to rouse poor Robert to a proper sense of the solemnity of the dinner question. He (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) muttered something to the effect that the man might bring him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) anything he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) liked, and the friendly waiter, who knew Robert as a frequent guest at the little tables, went back to his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) master with a doleful face, to say that Mr. Audley, from Figtree Court, was evidently out of spirits. Robert ate his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) dinner, and drank a pint of Moselle; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) had poor appreciation of the excellence of the viands or the delicate fragrance of the wine. The mental monologue still went on, and the young philosopher of the modern school was arguing the favorite modern question of the nothingness of everything, and the folly of taking too much trouble to walk upon a road that went nowhere, or to compass a work that meant nothing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I accept the dominion of that pale girl, with the statuesque features and the calm brown eyes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>philosopher</b></font>) thought. <div class="bookquote">``I recognize the power of a mind superior to my own, and I yield to it, and bow down to it. I've been acting for myself, and thinking for myself, for the last few months, and I'm tired of the unnatural business. I've been false to the leading principle of my life, and I've suffered for the folly. I found two gray hairs in my head the week before last, and an impertinent crow has planted a delicate impression of his (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) foot under my right eye. Yes, I'm getting old upon the right side; and why--why should it be so?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>philosopher</b></font>) pushed away his (<font color='blue'><b>philosopher</b></font>) plate and lifted his (<font color='blue'><b>philosopher</b></font>) eyebrows, staring at the crumbs upon the glistening damask, as he (<font color='blue'><b>philosopher</b></font>) pondered the question.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What the devil am I doing in this galere?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>philosopher</b></font>) asked. <div class="bookquote">``But I am in it, and I can't get out of it; so I better submit myself to the brown-eyed girl, and do what she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) tells me patiently and faithfully. What a wonderful solution to life's enigma there is in petticoat government! Man might lie in the sunshine, and eat lotuses, and fancy it `always afternoon,''  (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div>if his (<font color='blue'><b>philosopher</b></font>) wife would let him (<font color='blue'><b>philosopher</b></font>)! But she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) won't, bless her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) impulsive heart and active mind! She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) knows better than that. Who ever heard of a woman taking life as it ought to be taken? Instead of supporting it as an unavoidable nuisance, only redeemable by its brevity, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) goes through it as if it were a pageant or a procession. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) dresses for it, and simpers and grins, and gesticulates for it. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) pushes her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) neighbors, and struggles for a good place in the dismal march; she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) elbows, and writhes, and tramples, and prances to the one end of making the most of the misery. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) gets up early and sits up late, and is loud, and restless, and noisy, and unpitying. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) drags her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) husband on to the woolsack, or pushes him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) into Parliament. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) drives him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) full butt at the dear, lazy machinery of government, and knocks and buffets him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) about the wheels, and cranks, and screws, and pulleys; until somebody, for quiet's sake, makes him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) something that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) wanted him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) to be made. That's why incompetent men sometimes sit in high places, and interpose their poor, muddled intellects between the things to be done and the people that can do them, making universal confusion in the helpless innocence of well-placed incapacity. The square men in the round holes are pushed into them by their wives. The Eastern potentate who declared that women were at the bottom of all mischief, should have gone a little further and seen why it is so. It is because women are never lazy. They don't know what it is to be quiet. They are Semiramides, and Cleopatras, and Joans of Arc, Queen Elizabeths, and Catharines the Second, and they riot in battle, and murder, and clamor and desperation. If they can't agitate the universe and play at ball with hemispheres, they'll make mountains of warfare and vexation out of domestic molehills, and social storms in household teacups. Forbid them to hold forth upon the freedom of nations and the wrongs of mankind, and they'll quarrel with Mrs. Jones about the shape of a mantle or the character of a small maid-servant. To call them the weaker sex is to utter a hideous mockery. They are the stronger sex, the noisier, the more persevering, the most self-assertive sex. They want freedom of opinion, variety of occupation, do they? Let them have it. Let them be lawyers, doctors, preachers, teachers, soldiers, legislators--anything they like--but let them be quiet--if they can.''

<p/>Mr. Audley pushed his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) hands through the thick luxuriance of his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) straight brown hair, and uplifted the dark mass in his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) despair.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hate women,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) thought, savagely. <div class="bookquote">``They're bold, brazen, abominable creatures, invented for the annoyance and destruction of their superiors. Look at this business of poor George's! It's all woman's work from one end to the other. He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) marries a woman, and his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) father casts him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) off penniless and professionless. He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) hears of the woman's death and he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) breaks his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) heart--his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) good honest, manly heart, worth a million of the treacherous lumps of self-interest and mercenary calculation which beats in women's breasts. He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) goes to a woman's house and he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) is never seen alive again. And now I find myself driven into a corner by another woman, of whose existence I had never thought until this day. And--and then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>mused Mr. Audley, rather irrelevantly, <div class="bookquote">``there's Alicia, too; she (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>)'s another nuisance. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>)'d like me to marry her (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) I know; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>)'ll make me do it, I dare say, before she (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>)'s done with me. But I'd much rather not; though she (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) is a dear, bouncing, generous thing, bless her (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) poor little heart.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div><p/>Robert paid his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) bill and rewarded the waiter liberally. The young barrister was very willing to distribute his (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) comfortable little income among the people who served him (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>), for he (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) carried his (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) indifference to all things in the universe, even to the matter of pounds, shillings and pence. Perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) was rather exceptional in this, as you may frequently find that the philosopher who calls life an empty delusion is pretty sharp in the investment of his (<font color='blue'><b>philosopher</b></font>) moneys, and recognizes the tangible nature of India bonds, Spanish certificates, and Egyptian scrip--as contrasted with the painful uncertainty of an Ego or a non-Ego in metaphysics.

<p/>The snug rooms in Figtree Court seemed dreary in their orderly quiet to Robert Audley upon this particular evening. He (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) had no inclination for his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) French novels, though there was a packet of uncut romances, comic and sentimental, ordered a month before, waiting his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) pleasure upon one of the tables. He (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) favorite meerschaum and dropped into his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) favorite chair with a sigh.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's comfortable, but it seems so deuced lonely to-night. If poor George were sitting opposite to me, or--or even George's sister--she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)'s very like him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)--existence might be a little more endurable. But when a fellow's lived by himself for eight or ten years he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) begins to be bad company.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) burst out laughing presently as he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) finished his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) first pipe.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The idea of my thinking of George's sister,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) thought; <div class="bookquote">``what a preposterous idiot I am!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The next day's post brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) a letter in a firm but feminine hand, which was strange to him (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) found the little packet lying on his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) breakfast-table, beside the warm French roll wrapped in a napkin by Mrs. Maloney's careful but rather dirty hands. He (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) contemplated the envelope for some minutes before opening it--not in any wonder as to his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) correspondent, for the letter bore the postmark of Grange Heath, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Heath</b></font>) knew that there was only one person who was likely to write to him (<font color='blue'><b>Heath</b></font>) from that obscure village, but in that lazy dreaminess which was a part of his (<font color='blue'><b>Heath</b></font>) character.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``From Clara Talboys,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Heath</b></font>) murmured slowly, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Heath</b></font>) looked critically at the clearly-shaped letters of his (<font color='blue'><b>Heath</b></font>) name and address. <div class="bookquote">``Yes, from Clara Talboys, most decidedly; I recognized a feminine resemblance to poor George's hand; neater than his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>), and more decided than his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>), but very like, very like.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Heath</b></font>) turned the letter over and examined the seal, which bore his (<font color='blue'><b>Heath</b></font>) friend's familiar crest.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wonder what she (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) says to me?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Heath</b></font>) thought. <div class="bookquote">``It's a long letter, I dare say; she (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>)'s the kind of woman who would write a long letter--a letter that will urge me on, drive me forward, wrench me out of myself, I've no doubt. But that can't be helped--so here goes!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Heath</b></font>) tore open the envelope with a sigh of resignation. It contained nothing but George's two letters, and a few words written on the flap: <div class="bookquote">``I send the letters; please preserve and return them--C.T.''

 (<font color='red'><b>George/George Talboys/Mr. Talboys</b></font>)</div><p/>The letter, written from Liverpool, told nothing of the writer's life except his (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) sudden determination of starting for a new world, to redeem the fortunes that had been ruined in the old. The letter written almost immediately after George's marriage, contained a full description of his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) wife--such a description as a man could only write within three weeks of a love match--a description in which every feature was minutely catalogued, every grace of form or beauty of expression fondly dwelt upon, every charm of manner lovingly depicted.

<p/>Robert Audley read the letter three times before he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) laid it down.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If George could have known for what a purpose this description would serve when he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) wrote it,''  (<font color='red'><b>the barrister</b></font>)</div>thought the young barrister, <div class="bookquote">``surely his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) hand would have fallen paralyzed by horror, and powerless to shape one syllable of these tender words.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the barrister</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER XXV.

<p/>RETROGRADE INVESTIGATION.

<p/>The dreary London January dragged its dull length slowly out. The last slender records of Christmas time were swept away, and Robert Audley still lingered in town--still spent his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) lonely evenings in his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) quiet sitting-room in Figtree Court--still wandered listlessly in the Temple Gardens on sunny mornings, absently listening to the children's babble, idly watching their play. He (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) had many friends among the inhabitants of the quaint old buildings round him (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) had other friends far away in pleasant country places, whose spare bedrooms were always at Bob's service, whose cheerful firesides had snugly luxurious chairs specially allotted to him (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>). But he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) seemed to have lost all taste for companionship, all sympathy with the pleasures and occupations of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) class, since the disappearance of George Talboys. Elderly benchers indulged in facetious observations upon the young man's pale face and moody manner. They suggested the probability of some unhappy attachment, some feminine ill-usage as the secret cause of the change. They told him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to be of good cheer, and invited him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to supper-parties, at which <div class="bookquote">``lovely woman, with all her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) faults, God bless her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>was drunk by gentlemen who shed tears as they proposed the toast, and were maudlin and unhappy in their cups toward the close of the entertainment. Robert had no inclination for the wine-bibbing and the punch-making. The one idea of his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) life had become his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) master. He (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) was the bonden slave of one gloomy thought--one horrible presentiment. A dark cloud was brooding above his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) uncle's house, and it was his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) hand which was to give the signal for the thunder-clap, and the tempest that was to ruin that noble life.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would only take warning and run away,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) said to himself sometimes. <div class="bookquote">``Heaven knows, I have given her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) a fair chance. Why doesn't she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) take it and run away?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) heard sometimes from Sir Michael, sometimes from Alicia. The young lady's letter rarely contained more than a few curt lines informing him (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) that her (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) papa was well; and that Lady Audley was in very high spirits, amusing herself in her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) usual frivolous manner, and with her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) usual disregard for other people.

<p/>A letter from Mr. Marchmont, the Southampton schoolmaster, informed Robert that little Georgey was going on very well, but that he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) was behindhand in his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) education, and had not yet passed the intellectual Rubicon of words of two syllables. Captain Maldon had called to see his (<font color='blue'><b>Maldon</b></font>) grandson, but that privilege had been withheld from him (<font color='blue'><b>Maldon</b></font>), in accordance with Mr. Audley's instructions. The old man had furthermore sent a parcel of pastry and sweetmeats to the little boy, which had also been rejected on the ground of indigestible and bilious tendencies in the edibles.

<p/>Toward the close of February, Robert received a letter from his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) cousin Alicia, which hurried him (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) one step further forward toward his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) destiny, by causing him (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) to return to the house from which he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) had become in a manner exiled at the instigation of his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) uncle's wife.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Papa is very ill,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alicia/Miss Audley/Miss Alicia</b></font>)</div>Alicia wrote; ``not dangerously ill, thank God; but confined to his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) room by an attack of low fever which has succeeded a violent cold. Come and see him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), Robert, if you have any regard for your nearest relations. He (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) has spoken about you several times; and I know he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) will be glad to have you with him (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>). Come at once, but say nothing about this letter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``From your affectionate cousin, ALICIA.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div><p/>A sick and deadly terror chilled Robert Audley's heart, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) read this letter--a vague yet hideous fear, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) dared not shape into any definite form.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have I done right?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) thought, in the first agony of this new horror--<div class="bookquote">``have I done right to tamper with justice; and to keep the secret of my doubts in the hope that I was shielding those I love from sorrow and disgrace? What shall I do if I find him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) ill, very ill, dying perhaps, dying upon her (<font color='blue'><b>ALICIA</b></font>) breast! What shall I do?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>One course lay clear before him (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>); and the first step of that course was a rapid journey to Audley Court. He (<font color='blue'><b>Court</b></font>) packed his (<font color='blue'><b>Court</b></font>) portmanteau, jumped into a cab, and reached the railway station within an hour of his (<font color='blue'><b>Court</b></font>) receipt of Alicia's letter, which had come by the afternoon post.

<p/>The dim village lights flickered faintly through the growing dusk when Robert reached Audley. He (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) left his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) portmanteau with the station-master, and walked at a leisurely pace through the quiet lanes that led away to the still loneliness of the Court. The over-arching trees stretched their leafless branches above his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) head, bare and weird in the dusky light. A low moaning wind swept across the flat meadow land, and tossed those rugged branches hither and thither against the dark gray sky. They looked like the ghostly arms of shrunken and withered giants, beckoning Robert to his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) uncle's house. They looked like threatening phantoms in the chill winter twilight, gesticulating to him (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) to hasten upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) journey. The long avenue so bright and pleasant when the perfumed limes scattered their light bloom upon the pathway, and the dog-rose leaves floated on the summer air, was terribly bleak and desolate in the cheerless interregnum that divides the homely joys of Christmas from the pale blush of coming spring--a dead pause in the year, in which Nature seems to lie in a tranced sleep, awaiting the wondrous signal for the budding of the flower.

<p/>A mournful presentiment crept into Robert Audley's heart as he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) drew nearer to his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) uncle's house. Every changing outline in the landscape was familiar to him (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>); every bend of the trees; every caprice of the untrammeled branches; every undulation in the bare hawthorn hedge, broken by dwarf horse-chestnuts, stunted willows, blackberry and hazel bushes.

<p/>Sir Michael had been a second father to the young man, a generous and noble friend, a grave and earnest adviser; and perhaps the strongest sentiment of Robert's heart was his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) love for the gray-bearded baronet. But the grateful affection was so much a part of himself, that it seldom found an outlet in words, and a stranger would never have fathomed the depth of feeling which lay, a deep and powerful current, beneath the stagnant surface of the barrister's character.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What would become of this place if my uncle were to die?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) thought, and he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) drew nearer to the ivied archway, and the still water-pools, coldly gray in the twilight. <div class="bookquote">``Would other people live in the old house, and sit under the low oak ceilings in the homely familiar rooms?''

 (<font color='red'><b>That faculty</b></font>)</div><p/>That wonderful faculty of association, so interwoven with the inmost fibers of even the hardest nature, filled the young man's breast with a prophetic pain as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) remembered that, however long or late, the day must come on which the oaken shutters would be closed for awhile, and the sunshine shut out of the house he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) loved. It was painful to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) even to remember this; as it must always be painful to think of the narrow lease the greatest upon this earth can ever hold of its grandeurs. Is it so wonderful that some wayfarers drop asleep under the hedges, scarcely caring to toil onward on a journey that leads to no abiding habitation? Is it wonderful that there have been quietists in the world ever since Christ's religion was first preached upon earth. Is it strange that there is a patient endurance and tranquil resignation, calm expectation of that which is to come on the further shore of the dark flowing river? Is it not rather to be wondered that anybody should ever care to be great for greatness' sake; for any other reason than pure conscientiousness; the simple fidelity of the servant who fears to lay his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) talents by in a napkin, knowing that indifference is near akin to dishonesty? If Robert Audley had lived in the time of Thomas à Kempis, he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) would very likely have built himself a narrow hermitage amid some forest loneliness, and spent his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) life in tranquil imitation of the reputed author of The Imitation. As it was, Figtree Court was a pleasant hermitage in its way, and for breviaries and Books of Hours, I am ashamed to say the young barrister substituted Paul de Kock and Dumas, fils. But his (<font color='blue'><b>Dumas</b></font>) sins were of so simply negative an order, that it would have been very easy for him (<font color='blue'><b>Dumas</b></font>) to have abandoned them for negative virtues.

<p/>Only one solitary light was visible in the long irregular range of windows facing the archway, as Robert passed under the gloomy shade of the rustling ivy, restless in the chill moaning of the wind. He (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) recognized that lighted window as the large oriel in his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) uncle's room. When last he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) had looked at the old house it had been gay with visitors, every window glittering like a low star in the dusk; now, dark and silent, it faced the winter's night like some dismal baronial habitation, deep in a woodland solitude.

<p/>The man who opened the door to the unlooked-for visitor, brightened as he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) recognized his (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) master's nephew.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sir Michael will be cheered up a bit, sir, by the sight of you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) said, as he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) ushered Robert Audley into the fire-lit library, which seemed desolate by reason of the baronet's easy-chair standing empty on the broad hearth-rug. <div class="bookquote">``Shall I bring you some dinner here, sir, before you go up-stairs?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>the servant asked. <div class="bookquote">``My lady and Miss Audley have dined early during my master's illness, but I can bring you anything you would please to take, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll take nothing until I have seen my uncle,''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>Robert answered, hurriedly; <div class="bookquote">``that is to say, if I can see him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) at once. He (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) is not too ill to receive me, I suppose?''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) added, anxiously.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, no, sir--not too ill; only a little low, sir. This way, if you please.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) conducted Robert up the short flight of shallow oaken stairs to the octagon chamber in which George Talboys had sat long five months before, staring absently at my lady's portrait. The picture was finished now, and hung in the post of honor opposite the window, amidst Claudes, Poussins and Wouvermans, whose less brilliant hues were killed by the vivid coloring of the modern artist. The bright face looked out of that tangled glitter of golden hair, in which the Pre-Raphaelites delight, with a mocking smile, as Robert paused for a moment to glance at the well-remembered picture. Two or three moments afterward he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) had passed through my lady's boudoir and dressing-room and stood upon the threshold of Sir Michael's room. The baronet lay in a quiet sleep, his (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) arm laying outside the bed, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) strong hand clasped in his (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) young wife's delicate fingers. Alicia sat in a low chair beside the broad open hearth, on which the huge logs burned fiercely in the frosty atmosphere. The interior of this luxurious bedchamber might have made a striking picture for an artist's pencil. The massive furniture, dark and somber, yet broken up and relieved here and there by scraps of gilding, and masses of glowing color; the elegance of every detail, in which wealth was subservient to purity of taste; and last, but greatest in importance, the graceful figures of the two women, and the noble form of the old man would have formed a worthy study for any painter.

<p/>Lucy Audley, with her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) disordered hair in a pale haze of yellow gold about her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thoughtful face, the flowing lines of her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) soft muslin dressing-gown falling in straight folds to her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) feet, and clasped at the waist by a narrow circlet of agate links might have served as a model for a mediaeval saint, in one of the tiny chapels hidden away in the nooks and corners of a gray old cathedral, unchanged by Reformation or Cromwell; and what saintly martyr of the Middle Ages could have borne a holier aspect than the man whose gray beard lay upon the dark silken coverlet of the stately bed?

<p/>Robert paused upon the threshold, fearful of awaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) uncle. The two ladies had heard his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) step, cautious though he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) had been, and lifted their heads to look at him (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>). My lady's face, quietly watching the sick man, had worn an anxious earnestness which made it only more beautiful; but the same face recognizing Robert Audley, faded from its delicate brightness, and looked scared and wan in the lamplight.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Audley!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) cried, in a faint, tremulous voice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hush!''  (<font color='red'><b>Alicia/Miss Audley/Miss Alicia</b></font>)</div>whispered Alicia, with a warning gesture; <div class="bookquote">``you will wake papa. How good of you to come, Robert,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alicia/Miss Audley/Miss Alicia</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) added, in the same whispered tones, beckoning to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) cousin to take an empty chair near the bed.

<p/>The young man seated himself in the indicated seat at the bottom of the bed, and opposite to my lady, who sat close beside the pillows. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) looked long and earnestly at the face of the sleeper; still longer, still more earnestly at the face of Lady Audley, which was slowly recovering its natural hues.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) has not been very ill, has he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>Robert asked, in the same key as that in which Alicia had spoken.

<p/>My lady answered the question.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, no, not dangerously ill,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said, without taking her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) eyes from her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) husband's face; <div class="bookquote">``but still we have been anxious, very, very anxious.''

 (<font color='red'><b>husband</b></font>)</div><p/>Robert never relaxed his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) scrutiny of that pale face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) shall look at me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) thought; <div class="bookquote">``I will make her (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) meet my eyes, and I will read her (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) as I have read her (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) before. She (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) shall know how useless her (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) artifices are with me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) paused for a few minutes before he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) spoke again. The regular breathing of the sleeper the ticking of a gold hunting-watch at the head of the bed, and the crackling of the burning logs, were the only sounds that broke the stillness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have no doubt you have been anxious, Lady Audley,''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>Robert said, after a pause, fixing my lady's eyes as they wandered furtively to his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) face. <div class="bookquote">``There is no one to whom my uncle's life can be of more value than to you. Your happiness, your prosperity, your safety depend alike upon his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) existence.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The whisper in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) uttered these words was too low to reach the other side of the room, where Alicia sat.

<p/>Lucy Audley's eyes met those of the speaker with some gleam of triumph in their light.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I know that,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Those who strike me must strike through him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) pointed to the sleeper as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) spoke, still looking at Robert Audley. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) defied him (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) with her (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) blue eyes, their brightness intensified by the triumph in their glance. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) defied him (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) with her (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) quiet smile--a smile of fatal beauty, full of lurking significance and mysterious meaning--the smile which the artist had exaggerated in his (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) portrait of Sir Michael's wife.

<p/>Robert turned away from the lovely face, and shaded his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) eyes with his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) hand; putting a barrier between my lady and himself; a screen which baffled her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) penetration and provoked her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) curiosity. Was he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) still watching her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) or was he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) thinking? and of what was he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) thinking?

<p/>Robert had been seated at the bedside for upward of an hour before his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) uncle awoke. The baronet was delighted at his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) nephew's coming.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It was very good of you to come to me, Bob,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I have been thinking of you a good deal since I have been ill. You and Lucy must be good friends, you know, Bob; and you must learn to think of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) as your aunt, sir; though she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) is young and beautiful; and--and--you understand, eh?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div><p/>Robert grasped his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) uncle's hand, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) looked down as he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) answered: <div class="bookquote">``I do understand you, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) said, quietly; <div class="bookquote">``and I give you my word of honor that I am steeled against my lady's fascinations. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) knows that as well as I do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Lucy Audley made a little grimace with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) pretty little lips. <div class="bookquote">``Bah, you silly Robert,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) exclaimed; <div class="bookquote">``you take everything au serieux. If I thought you were rather too young for a nephew, it was only in my fear of other people's foolish gossip; not from any--''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) hesitated for a moment, and escaped any conclusion to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) sentence by the timely intervention of Mr. Dawson, her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) late employer, who entered the room upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Dawson</b></font>) evening visit while she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was speaking.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Dawson</b></font>) felt the patient's pulse; asked two or three questions; pronounced the baronet to be steadily improving; exchanged a few commonplace remarks with Alicia and Lady Audley, and prepared to leave the room. Robert rose and accompanied him (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) to the door.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I will light you to the staircase,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) said, taking a candle from one of the tables, and lighting it at the lamp.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no, Mr. Audley, pray do not trouble yourself,''  (<font color='red'><b>the surgeon</b></font>)</div>expostulated the surgeon; <div class="bookquote">``I know my way very well indeed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the surgeon</b></font>)</div><p/>Robert insisted, and the two men left the room together. As they entered the octagon ante-chamber the barrister paused and shut the door behind him (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Will you see that the door is closed, Mr. Dawson?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) said, pointing to that which opened upon the staircase. <div class="bookquote">``I wish to have a few moments' private conversation with you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``With much pleasure,''  (<font color='red'><b>the surgeon</b></font>)</div>replied the surgeon, complying with Robert's request; <div class="bookquote">``but if you are at all alarmed about your uncle, Mr. Audley, I can set your mind at rest. There is no occasion for the least uneasiness. Had his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) illness been at all serious I should have telegraphed immediately for the family physician.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sure that you would have done your duty, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>answered Robert, gravely. <div class="bookquote">``But I am not going to speak of my uncle. I wish to ask you two or three questions about another person.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The person who once lived in your family as Miss Lucy Graham; the person who is now Lady Audley.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Dawson/Dawson</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Dawson looked up with an expression of surprise upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Dawson</b></font>) quiet face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Pardon me, Mr. Audley,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Dawson</b></font>) answered; <div class="bookquote">``you can scarcely expect me to answer any questions about your uncle's wife without Sir Michael's express permission. I can understand no motive which can prompt you to ask such questions--no worthy motive, at least.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Dawson</b></font>) looked severely at the young man, as much as to say: <div class="bookquote">``You have been falling in love with your uncle's pretty wife, sir, and you want to make me a go-between in some treacherous flirtation; but it won't do, sir, it won't do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I always respected the lady as Miss Graham, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Dawson</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``and I esteem her (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) doubly as Lady Audley--not on account of her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) altered position, but because she (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) is the wife of one of the noblest men in Christendom.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You cannot respect my uncle or my uncle's honor more sincerely than I do,''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>answered Robert. <div class="bookquote">``I have no unworthy motive for the questions I am about to ask; and you must answer them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Must!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Dawson/Dawson</b></font>)</div>echoed Mr. Dawson, indignantly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, you are my uncle's friend. It was at your house he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) met the woman who is now his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) wife. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) called herself an orphan, I believe, and enlisted his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) pity as well as his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) admiration in her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) behalf. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) told him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) stood alone in the world, did she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) not?--without a friend or relative. This was all I could ever learn of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) antecedents.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What reason have you to wish to know more?''  (<font color='red'><b>the surgeon</b></font>)</div>asked the surgeon.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A very terrible reason,''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>answered Robert Audley. <div class="bookquote">``For some months past I have struggled with doubts and suspicions which have embittered my life. They have grown stronger every day; and they will not be set at rest by the commonplace sophistries and the shallow arguments with which men try to deceive themselves rather than believe that which of all things upon earth they most fear to believe. I do not think that the woman who bears my uncle's name, is worthy to be his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) wife. I may wrong her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>). Heaven grant that it is so. But if I do, the fatal chain of circumstantial evidence never yet linked itself so closely about an innocent person. I wish to set my doubts at rest or--or to confirm my fears. There is but one manner in which I can do this. I must trace the life of my uncle's wife backward, minutely and carefully, from this night to a period of six years ago. This is the twenty-fourth of February, fifty-nine. I want to know every record of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) life between to-night and the February of the year fifty-three.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And your motive is a worthy one?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I wish to clear her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) from a very dreadful suspicion.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Which exists only in your mind?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And in the mind of one other person.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``May I ask who that person is?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, Mr. Dawson,''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>answered Robert, decisively; <div class="bookquote">``I cannot reveal anything more than what I have already told you. I am a very irresolute, vacillating man in most things. In this matter I am compelled to be decided. I repeat once more that I must know the history of Lucy Graham's life. If you refuse to help me to the small extent in your power, I will find others who will help me. Painful as it would become, I will ask my uncle for the information which you would withhold, rather than be baffled in the first step of my investigation.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Dawson was silent for some minutes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I cannot express how much you have astonished and alarmed me, Mr. Audley.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Dawson</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I can tell you so little about Lady Audley's antecedents, that it would be mere obstinacy to withhold the small amount of information I possess. I have always considered your uncle's wife one of the most amiable of women. I cannot bring myself to think her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) otherwise. It would be an uprooting of one of the strongest convictions of my life were I compelled to think her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) otherwise. You wish to follow her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) life backward from the present hour to the year fifty-three?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was married to your uncle last June twelvemonth, in the midsummer of fifty-seven. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had lived in my house a little more than thirteen months. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) became a member of my household upon the fourteenth of May, in the year fifty-six.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) came to you--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``From a school at Brompton, a school kept by a lady of the name of Vincent. It was Mrs. Vincent's strong recommendation that induced me to receive Miss Graham into my family without any more special knowledge of her (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) antecedents.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did you see this Mrs. Vincent?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I did not. I advertised for a governess, and Miss Graham answered my advertisement. In her (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) letter she (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) referred me to Mrs. Vincent, the proprietress of a school in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) was then residing as junior teacher. My time is always so fully occupied, that I was glad to escape the necessity of a day's loss in going from Audley to London to inquire about the young lady's qualifications. I looked for Mrs. Vincent's name in the directory, found it, and concluded that she (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) was a responsible person, and wrote to her (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>). Her (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) reply was perfectly satisfactory;--Miss Lucy Graham was assiduous and conscientious; as well as fully qualified for the situation I offered. I accepted this reference, and I had no cause to regret what may have been an indiscretion. And now, Mr. Audley, I have told you all that I have the power to tell.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Will you be so kind as to give me the address of this Mrs. Vincent?''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>asked Robert, taking out his (<font color='blue'><b>Dawson</b></font>) pocketbook.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly; she (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) was then living at No. 9 Crescent Villas, Brompton.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, to be sure,''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>muttered Mr. Audley, a recollection of last September flashing suddenly back upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) as the surgeon spoke.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Crescent Villas--yes, I have heard the address before from Lady Audley herself. This Mrs. Vincent telegraphed to my uncle's wife early in last September. She (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) was ill--dying, I believe--and sent for my lady; but had removed from her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) old house and was not to be found.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed! I never heard Lady Audley mention the circumstance.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps not. It occurred while I was down here. Thank you, Mr. Dawson, for the information you have so kindly and honestly given me. It takes me back two and a-half years in the history of my lady's life; but I have still a blank of three years to fill up before I can exonerate her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) from my terrible suspicion. Good evening.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div><p/>Robert shook hands with the surgeon and returned to his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) uncle's room. He (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) had been away about a quarter of an hour. Sir Michael had fallen asleep once more, and my lady's loving hands had lowered the heavy curtains and shaded the lamp by the bedside. Alicia and her (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) father's wife were taking tea in Lady Audley's boudoir, the room next to the antechamber in which Robert and Mr. Dawson had been seated.

<p/>Lucy Audley looked up from her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) occupation among the fragile china cups and watched Robert rather anxiously as he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) walked softly to his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) uncle's room and back again to the boudoir. She (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) looked very pretty and innocent, seated behind the graceful group of delicate opal china and glittering silver. Surely a pretty woman never looks prettier than when making tea. The most feminine and most domestic of all occupations imparts a magic harmony to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) every movement, a witchery to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) every glance. The floating mists from the boiling liquid in which she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) infuses the soothing herbs; whose secrets are known to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) alone, envelope her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) in a cloud of scented vapor, through which she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) seems a social fairy, weaving potent spells with Gunpowder and Bohea. At the tea-table she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) reigns omnipotent, unapproachable. What do men know of the mysterious beverage? Read how poor Hazlitt made his (<font color='blue'><b>Hazlitt</b></font>) tea, and shudder at the dreadful barbarism. How clumsily the wretched creatures attempt to assist the witch president of the tea-tray; how hopelessly they hold the kettle, how continually they imperil the frail cups and saucers, or the taper hands of the priestess. To do away with the tea-table is to rob woman of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) legitimate empire. To send a couple of hulking men about among your visitors, distributing a mixture made in the housekeeper's room, is to reduce the most social and friendly of ceremonies to a formal giving out of rations. Better the pretty influence of the tea cups and saucers gracefully wielded in a woman's hand than all the inappropriate power snatched at the point of the pen from the unwilling sterner sex. Imagine all the women of England elevated to the high level of masculine intellectuality, superior to crinoline; above pearl powder and Mrs. Rachael Levison; above taking the pains to be pretty; above tea-tables and that cruelly scandalous and rather satirical gossip which even strong men delight in; and what a drear, utilitarian, ugly life the sterner sex must lead.

<p/>My lady was by no means strong-minded. The starry diamonds upon her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) white fingers flashed hither and thither among the tea-things, and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) bent her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) pretty head over the marvelous Indian tea-caddy of sandal-wood and silver, with as much earnestness as if life held no higher purpose than the infusion of Bohea.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You'll take a cup of tea with us, Mr. Audley?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) asked, pausing with the teapot in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) hand to look up at Robert, who was standing near the door.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you please.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you have not dined, perhaps? Shall I ring and tell them to bring you something a little more substantial than biscuits and transparent bread and butter?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, thank you, Lady Audley. I took some lunch before I left town. I'll trouble you for nothing but a cup of tea.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) seated himself at the little table and looked across it at his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) Cousin Alicia, who sat with a book in her (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) lap, and had the air of being very much absorbed by its pages. The bright brunette complexion had lost its glowing crimson, and the animation of the young lady's manner was suppressed--on account of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) father's illness, no doubt, Robert thought.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Alicia, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>the barrister</b></font>)</div>the barrister said, after a very leisurely contemplation of his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) cousin, <div class="bookquote">``you're not looking well.''

 (<font color='red'><b>cousin</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Audley shrugged her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) shoulders, but did not condescend to lift her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) eyes from her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) book.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps not,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) answered, contemptuously. <div class="bookquote">``What does it matter? I'm growing a philosopher of your school, Robert Audley. What does it matter? Who cares whether I am well or ill?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What a spitfire she (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) is,''  (<font color='red'><b>the barrister</b></font>)</div>thought the barrister. He (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) always knew his (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) cousin was angry with him (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) when she (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) addressed him (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) as <div class="bookquote">``Robert Audley.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You needn't pitch into a fellow because he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) asks you a civil question, Alicia,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) said, reproachfully. <div class="bookquote">``As to nobody caring about your health, that's nonsense. I care.''  (<font color='red'><b>Alicia/Miss Audley/Miss Alicia</b></font>)</div>Miss Audley looked up with a bright smile. <div class="bookquote">``Sir Harry Towers cares.''  (<font color='red'><b>Alicia/Miss Audley/Miss Alicia</b></font>)</div>Miss Audley returned to her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) book with a frown.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What are you reading there, Alicia?''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>Robert asked, after a pause, during which he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) had sat thoughtfully stirring his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) tea.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Changes and Chances.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A novel?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who is it by?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The author of Follies and Faults,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alicia/Miss Audley/Miss Alicia</b></font>)</div>answered Alicia, still pursuing her (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) study of the romance upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) lap.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it interesting?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Alicia/Miss Audley/Miss Alicia</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Audley pursed up her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) mouth and shrugged her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) shoulders.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not particularly,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then I think you might have better manners than to read it while your first cousin is sitting opposite you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>observed Mr. Audley, with some gravity, <div class="bookquote">``especially as he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) has only come to pay you a flying visit, and will be off to-morrow morning.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To-morrow morning!''  (<font color='red'><b>lady</b></font>)</div>exclaimed my lady, looking up suddenly.

<p/>Though the look of joy upon Lady Audley's face was as brief as a flash of lightning on a summer sky, it was not unperceived by Robert.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``I shall be obliged to run up to London to-morrow on business, but I shall return the next day, if you will allow me, Lady Audley, and stay here till my uncle recovers.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you are not seriously alarmed about him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>), are you?''  (<font color='red'><b>lady</b></font>)</div>asked my lady, anxiously.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You do not think him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) very ill?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>answered Robert. <div class="bookquote">``Thank Heaven, I think there is not the slightest cause for apprehension.''

 (<font color='red'><b>lady</b></font>)</div><p/>My lady sat silent for a few moments, looking at the empty teacups with a prettily thoughtful face--a face grave with the innocent seriousness of a musing child.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But you were closeted such a long time with Mr. Dawson, just now,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said, after this brief pause. <div class="bookquote">``I was quite alarmed at the length of your conversation. Were you talking of Sir Michael all the time?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; not all the time?''

 (<font color='red'><b>lady</b></font>)</div><p/>My lady looked down at the teacups once more.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, what could you find to say to Mr. Dawson, or he (<font color='blue'><b>Dawson</b></font>) to say to you?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) asked, after another pause. <div class="bookquote">``You are almost strangers to each other.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Suppose Mr. Dawson wished to consult me about some law business.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Was it that?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Audley/LADY AUDLEY</b></font>)</div>cried Lady Audley, eagerly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It would be rather unprofessional to tell you if it were so, my lady,''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>answered Robert, gravely.

<p/>My lady bit her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) lip, and relapsed into silence. Alicia threw down her (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) book, and watched her (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) cousin's preoccupied face. He (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) talked to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) now and then for a few minutes, but it was evidently an effort to him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) to arouse himself from his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) revery.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Upon my word, Robert Audley, you are a very agreeable companion,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alicia/Miss Audley/Miss Alicia</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Alicia at length, her (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) rather limited stock of patience quite exhausted by two or three of these abortive attempts at conversation. <div class="bookquote">``Perhaps the next time you come to the Court you will be good enough to bring your mind with you. By your present inanimate appearance, I should imagine that you had left your intellect, such as it is, somewhere in the Temple. You were never one of the liveliest of people, but latterly you have really grown almost unendurable. I suppose you are in love, Mr. Audley, and are thinking of the honored object of your affections.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) was thinking of Clara Talboys' uplifted face, sublime in its unutterable grief; of her (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) impassioned words still ringing in his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) ears as clearly as when they were first spoken. Again he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) with her (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) bright brown eyes. Again he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) heard that solemn question: <div class="bookquote">``Shall you or I find my brother's murderer?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) was in Essex; in the little village from which he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) firmly believed George Talboys had never departed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) was on the spot at which all record of his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) friend's life ended as suddenly as a story ends when the reader shuts the book. And could he (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) withdraw now from the investigation in which he (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) found himself involved? Could he (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) stop now? For any consideration? No; a thousand times no! Not with the image of that grief-stricken face imprinted on his (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) mind. Not with the accents of that earnest appeal ringing on his (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) ear.

<p/>CHAPTER XXVI.

<p/>SO FAR AND NO FARTHER.

<p/>Robert left Audley the next morning by an early train, and reached Shoreditch a little after nine o'clock. He (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) did not return to his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) chambers, but called a cab and drove straight to Crescent Villas, West Brompton. He (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) should fail in finding the lady he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) went to seek at this address, as his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) uncle had failed a few months before, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) thought it possible to obtain some clew to the schoolmistress' new residence, in spite of Sir Michael's ill-success.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Vincent was in a dying state, according to the telegraphic message,''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>Robert thought. <div class="bookquote">``If I do find her (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>), I shall at least succeed in discovering whether that message was genuine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) found Crescent Villas after some difficulty. The houses were large, but they lay half imbedded among the chaos of brick and rising mortar around them. New terraces, new streets, new squares led away into hopeless masses of stone and plaster on every side. The roads were sticky with damp clay, which clogged the wheels of the cab and buried the fetlocks of the horse. The desolations--that awful aspect of incompleteness and discomfort which pervades a new and unfinished neighborhood--had set its dismal seal upon the surrounding streets which had arisen about and intrenched Crescent Villas; and Robert wasted forty minutes by his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) watch, and an hour and a quarter by the cabman's reckoning, in driving up and down uninhabited streets and terraces, trying to find the Villas; whose chimney-tops were frowning down upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) black and venerable, amid groves of virgin plaster, undimmed by time or smoke.

<p/>But having at last succeeded in reaching his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) destination, Mr. Audley alighted from the cab, directed the driver to wait for him (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) at a certain corner, and set out upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) voyage of discovery.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If I were a distinguished Q.C., I could not do this sort of thing,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) thought; <div class="bookquote">``my time would be worth a guinea or so a minute, and I should be retained in the great case of Hoggs vs. Boggs, going forward this very day before a special jury at Westminster Hall. As it is, I can afford to be patient.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) inquired for Mrs. Vincent at the number which Mr. Dawson had given him (<font color='blue'><b>Dawson</b></font>). The maid who opened the door had never heard that lady's name; but after going to inquire of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) mistress, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) returned to tell Robert that Mrs. Vincent had lived there, but that she (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) had left two months before the present occupants had entered the house, <div class="bookquote">``and missus has been here fifteen months,''  (<font color='red'><b>the occupants</b></font>)</div>the girl added emphatically.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But you cannot tell where she (<font color='blue'><b>missus</b></font>) went on leaving here?''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>Robert asked, despondingly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, sir; missus says she (<font color='blue'><b>missus</b></font>) believes the lady failed, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>missus</b></font>) left sudden like, and didn't want her (<font color='blue'><b>missus</b></font>) address to be known in the neighborhood.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Audley felt himself at a standstill once more. If Mrs. Vincent had left the place in debt, she (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) had no doubt scrupulously concealed her (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) whereabouts. There was little hope, then, of learning her (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) address from the tradespeople; and yet, on the other hand, it was just possible that some of her (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) sharpest creditors might have made it their business to discover the defaulter's retreat.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) looked about him (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) for the nearest shops, and found a baker's, a stationer's, and a fruiterer's a few paces from the Crescent. Three empty-looking, pretentious shops, with plate-glass windows, and a hopeless air of gentility.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) stopped at the baker's, who called himself a pastrycook and confectioner, and exhibited some specimens of petrified sponge-cake in glass bottles, and some highly-glazed tarts, covered with green gauze.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>missus</b></font>) must have bought bread,''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>Robert thought, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) deliberated before the baker's shop; <div class="bookquote">``and she (<font color='blue'><b>missus</b></font>) is likely to have bought it at the handiest place. I'll try the baker.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the baker</b></font>)</div><p/>The baker was standing behind his (<font color='blue'><b>baker</b></font>) counter, disputing the items of a bill with a shabby-genteel young woman. He (<font color='blue'><b>baker</b></font>) did not trouble himself to attend to Robert Audley until he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) had settled the dispute, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) looked up as he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) was receipting the bill, and asked the barrister what he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) pleased to want.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Can you tell me the address of a Mrs. Vincent, who lived at No. 9 Crescent Villas a year and a half ago?''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>Mr. Audley inquired, mildly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I can't,''  (<font color='red'><b>the baker</b></font>)</div>answered the baker, growing very red in the face, and speaking in an unnecessarily loud voice; <div class="bookquote">``and what's more, I wish I could. That lady owes me upward of eleven pound for bread, and it's rather more than I can afford to lose. If anybody can tell me where she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) lives, I shall be much obliged to 'em for so doing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the baker</b></font>)</div><p/>Robert Audley shrugged his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) shoulders and wished the man good-morning. He (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) felt that his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) discovery of the lady's whereabouts would involve more trouble than he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) had expected. He (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) might have looked for Mrs. Vincent's name in the Post-Office directory, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) thought it scarcely likely that a lady who was on such uncomfortable terms with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) creditors, would afford them so easy a means of ascertaining her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) residence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If the baker can't find her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), how should I find her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) thought, despairingly. <div class="bookquote">``If a resolute, sanguine, active and energetic creature, such as the baker, fail to achieve this business, how can a lymphatic wretch like me hope to accomplish it? Where the baker has been defeated, what preposterous folly it would be for me to try to succeed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Audley abandoned himself to these gloomy reflections as he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) walked slowly back toward the corner at which he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) had left the cab. About half-way between the baker's shop and this corner he (<font color='blue'><b>baker</b></font>) was arrested by hearing a woman's step close at his (<font color='blue'><b>baker</b></font>) side, and a woman's voice asking him (<font color='blue'><b>baker</b></font>) to stop. He (<font color='blue'><b>baker</b></font>) turned and found himself face to face with the shabbily-dressed woman whom he (<font color='blue'><b>baker</b></font>) had left settling her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) account with the baker.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Eh, what?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>baker</b></font>) asked, vaguely. <div class="bookquote">``Can I do anything for you, ma'am? Does Mrs. Vincent owe you money, too?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>the woman answered, with a semi-genteel manner which corresponded with the shabby gentility of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) dress. <div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Vincent is in my debt; but it isn't that, sir. I--I want to know, please, what your business may be with her (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>)--because--because--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You can give me her (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) address if you choose, ma'am. That's what you mean to say, isn't it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>The woman</b></font>)</div><p/>The woman hesitated a little, looking rather suspiciously at Robert.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You're not connected with--with the tally business, are you, sir?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) asked, after considering Mr. Audley's personal appearance for a few moments.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The what, ma'am?''  (<font color='red'><b>the barrister</b></font>)</div>asked the young barrister, staring aghast at his (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) questioner.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm sure I beg your pardon, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>exclaimed the little woman, seeing that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had made some awful mistake. <div class="bookquote">``I thought you might have been, you know. Some of the gentlemen who collect for the tally shops do dress so very handsome; and I know Mrs. Vincent owes a good deal of money.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div><p/>Robert Audley laid his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) hand upon the speaker's arm.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear madam,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I want to know nothing of Mrs. Vincent's affairs. So far from being concerned in what you call the tally business, I have not the remotest idea what you mean by that expression. You may mean a political conspiracy; you may mean some new species of taxes. Mrs. Vincent does not owe me any money, however badly she (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) may stand with that awful-looking baker. I never saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) in my life; but I wish to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) to-day for the simple purpose of asking her (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) a few very plain questions about a young lady who once resided in her (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) house. If you know where Mrs. Vincent lives and will give me her (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) address, you will be doing me a great favor.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) took out his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) card-case and handed a card to the woman, who examined the slip of pasteboard anxiously before she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) spoke again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm sure you look and speak like a gentleman, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said, after a brief pause, <div class="bookquote">``and I hope you will excuse me if I've seemed mistrustful like; but poor Mrs. Vincent has had dreadful difficulties, and I'm the only person hereabouts that she (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>)'s trusted with her (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) addresses. I'm a dressmaker, sir, and I've worked for her (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) for upward of six years, and though she (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) doesn't pay me regular, you know, sir, she (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) gives me a little money on account now and then, and I get on as well as I can. I may tell you where she (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) lives, then, sir? You haven't deceived me, have you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``On my honor, no.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, then sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>the dressmaker</b></font>)</div>said the dressmaker, dropping her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) voice as if she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) thought the pavement beneath her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) feet, or the iron railings before the houses by her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) side, might have ears to hear her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``it's Acacia Cottage, Peckham Grove. I took a dress there yesterday for Mrs. Vincent.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>said Robert, writing the address in his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) pocketbook. <div class="bookquote">``I am very much obliged to you, and you may rely upon it, Mrs. Vincent shall not suffer any inconvenience through me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) lifted his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) hat, bowed to the little dressmaker, and turned back to the cab.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have beaten the baker, at any rate,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) thought. <div class="bookquote">``Now for the second stage, traveling backward, in my lady's life.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Peckham</b></font>)</div><p/>The drive from Brompton to the Peckham Road was a very long one, and between Crescent Villas and Acacia Cottage, Robert Audley had ample leisure for reflection. He (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) thought of his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) uncle lying weak and ill in the oak-room at Audley Court. He (<font color='blue'><b>Court</b></font>) thought of the beautiful blue eyes watching Sir Michael's slumbers; the soft, white hands tending on his (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) waking moments; the low musical voice soothing his (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) loneliness, cheering and consoling his (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) declining years. What a pleasant picture it might have been, had he (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) been able to look upon it ignorantly, seeing no more than others saw, looking no further than a stranger could look. But with the black cloud which he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) saw brooding over it, what an arch mockery, what a diabolical delusion it seemed.

<p/>Peckham Grove--pleasant enough in the summer-time--has rather a dismal aspect upon a dull February day, when the trees are bare and leafless, and the little gardens desolate. Acacia Cottage bore small token of the fitness of its nomenclature, and faced the road with its stuccoed walls sheltered only by a couple of attenuated poplars. But it announced that it was Acacia Cottage by means of a small brass plate upon one of the gate-posts, which was sufficient indication for the sharp-sighted cabman, who dropped Mr. Audley upon the pavement before the little gate.

<p/>Acacia Cottage was much lower in the social scale than Crescent Villas, and the small maid-servant who came to the low wooden gate and parleyed with Mr. Audley, was evidently well used to the encounter of relentless creditors across the same feeble barricade.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>couple</b></font>) murmured the familiar domestic fiction of the uncertainty regarding her (<font color='blue'><b>couple</b></font>) mistress's whereabouts; and told Robert that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) would please to state his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) name and business, she (<font color='blue'><b>couple</b></font>) would go and see if Mrs. Vincent was at home.

<p/>Mr. Audley produced a card, and wrote in pencil under his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) own name: <div class="bookquote">``a connection of the late Miss Graham.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) directed the small servant to carry his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) card to her (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) mistress, and quietly awaited the result.

<p/>The servant returned in about five minutes with the key of the gate. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) mistress was at home, she (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) told Robert as she (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) admitted him (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>), and would be happy to see the gentleman.

<p/>The square parlor into which Robert was ushered bore in every scrap of ornament, in every article of furniture, the unmistakable stamp of that species of poverty which is most comfortless because it is never stationary. The mechanic who furnishes his (<font color='blue'><b>mechanic</b></font>) tiny sitting-room with half-a-dozen cane chairs, a Pembroke table, a Dutch clock, a tiny looking-glass, a crockery shepherd and shepherdess, and a set of gaudily-japanned iron tea-trays, makes the most of his (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) limited possessions, and generally contrives to get some degree of comfort out of them; but the lady who loses the handsome furniture of the house she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) is compelled to abandon and encamps in some smaller habitation with the shabby remainder--bought in by some merciful friend at the sale of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) effects--carries with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) an aspect of genteel desolation and tawdry misery not easily to be paralleled in wretchedness by any other phase which poverty can assume.

<p/>The room which Robert Audley surveyed was furnished with the shabbier scraps snatched from the ruin which had overtaken the imprudent schoolmistress in Crescent Villas. A cottage piano, a chiffonier, six sizes too large for the room, and dismally gorgeous in gilded moldings that were chipped and broken; a slim-legged card-table, placed in the post of honor, formed the principal pieces of furniture. A threadbare patch of Brussels carpet covered the center of the room, and formed an oasis of roses and lilies upon a desert of shabby green drugget. Knitted curtains shaded the windows, in which hung wire baskets of horrible-looking plants of the cactus species, that grew downward, like some demented class of vegetation, whose prickly and spider-like members had a fancy for standing on their heads.

<p/>The green-baize covered card-table was adorned with gaudily-bound annuals or books of beauty, placed at right angles; but Robert Audley did not avail himself of these literary distractions. He (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) seated himself upon one of the rickety chairs, and waited patiently for the advent of the schoolmistress. He (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) could hear the hum of half-a-dozen voices in a room near him (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>), and the jingling harmonies of a set of variations in Deh Conte, upon a piano, whose every wire was evidently in the last stage of attenuation.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Conte</b></font>) had waited for about a quarter of an hour, when the door was opened, and a lady, very much dressed, and with the setting sunlight of faded beauty upon her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) face, entered the room.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Audley, I presume,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said, motioning to Robert to reseat himself, and placing herself in an easy-chair opposite to him (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``You will pardon me, I hope, for detaining you so long; my duties--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is I who should apologize for intruding upon you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>Robert answered, politely; <div class="bookquote">``but my motive for calling upon you is a very serious one, and must plead my excuse. You remember the lady whose name I wrote upon my card?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perfectly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``May I ask how much you know of that lady's history since her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) departure from your house?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very little. In point of fact, scarcely anything at all. Miss Graham, I believe, obtained a situation in the family of a surgeon resident in Essex. Indeed, it was I who recommended her (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) to that gentleman. I have never heard from her (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) since she (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) left me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you have communicated with her (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>Robert asked, eagerly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, indeed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Audley was silent for a few moments, the shadow of gloomy thoughts gathering darkly on his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``May I ask if you sent a telegraphic dispatch to Miss Graham early in last September, stating that you were dangerously ill, and that you wished to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Vincent/Vincent</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Vincent smiled at her (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) visitor's question.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I had no occasion to send such a message,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``I have never been seriously ill in my life.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Robert Audley paused before he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) asked any further questions, and scrawled a few penciled words in his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) note-book.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If I ask you a few straightforward questions about Miss Lucy Graham, madam,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Will you do me the favor to answer them without asking my motive in making such inquiries?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Most certainly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Vincent/Vincent</b></font>)</div>replied Mrs. Vincent. <div class="bookquote">``I know nothing to Miss Graham's disadvantage, and have no justification for making a mystery of the little I do know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then will you tell me at what date the young lady first came to you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Vincent/Vincent</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Vincent smiled and shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) head. She (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) had a pretty smile--the frank smile of a woman who had been admired, and who has too long felt the certainty of being able to please, to be utterly subjugated by any worldly misfortune.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's not the least use to ask me, Mr. Audley,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I'm the most careless creature in the world; I never did, and never could remember dates, though I do all in my power to impress upon my girls how important it is for their future welfare that they should know when William the Conqueror began to reign, and all that kind of thing. But I haven't the remotest idea when Miss Graham came to me, although I know it was ages ago, for it was the very summer I had my peach-colored silk. But we must consult Tonks--Tonks is sure to be right.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div><p/>Robert Audley wondered who or what Tonks could be; a diary, perhaps, or a memorandum-book--some obscure rival of Letsome.

<p/>Mrs. Vincent rung the bell, which was answered by the maid-servant who had admitted Robert.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ask Miss Tonks to come to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I want to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Tonks</b></font>) particularly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Tonks/Tonks</b></font>)</div><p/>In less than five minutes Miss Tonks made her (<font color='blue'><b>Tonks</b></font>) appearance. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tonks</b></font>) was wintry and rather frost-bitten in aspect, and seemed to bring cold air in the scanty folds of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tonks</b></font>) somber merino dress. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tonks</b></font>) was no age in particular, and looked as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Tonks</b></font>) had never been younger, and would never grow older, but would remain forever working backward and forward in her (<font color='blue'><b>Tonks</b></font>) narrow groove, like some self-feeding machine for the instruction of young ladies.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tonks, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Vincent/Vincent</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Vincent, without ceremony, <div class="bookquote">``this gentleman is a relative of Miss Graham's. Do you remember how long it is since she (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) came to us at Crescent Villas?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Vincent/Vincent</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) came in August, 1854,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Tonks/Tonks</b></font>)</div>answered Miss Tonks; <div class="bookquote">``I think it was the eighteenth of August, but I'm not quite sure that it wasn't the seventeenth. I know it was on a Tuesday.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Tonks/Tonks</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you, Tonks; you are a most invaluable darling,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Vincent/Vincent</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Mrs. Vincent, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) sweetest smile. It was, perhaps, because of the invaluable nature of Miss Tonks' services that she (<font color='blue'><b>Tonks</b></font>) had received no remuneration whatever from her (<font color='blue'><b>Tonks</b></font>) employer for the last three or four years. Mrs. Vincent might have hesitated to pay from very contempt for the pitiful nature of the stipend as compared with the merits of the teacher.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is there anything else that Tonks or I can tell you, Mr. Audley?''  (<font color='red'><b>the schoolmistress</b></font>)</div>asked the schoolmistress. <div class="bookquote">``Tonks has a far better memory than I have.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Can you tell me where Miss Graham came from when she (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) entered your household?''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>Robert inquired.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not very precisely,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Vincent/Vincent</b></font>)</div>answered Mrs. Vincent. <div class="bookquote">``I have a vague notion that Miss Graham said something about coming from the seaside, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) didn't say where, or if she (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) did I have forgotten it. Tonks, did Miss Graham tell you where she (<font color='blue'><b>Tonks</b></font>) came from?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, no!''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Tonks/Tonks</b></font>)</div>replied Miss Tonks, shaking her (<font color='blue'><b>Tonks</b></font>) grim little head significantly. <div class="bookquote">``Miss Graham told me nothing; she (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) was too clever for that. She (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) knows how to keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) own secrets, in spite of her (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) innocent ways and her (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) curly hair,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Tonks/Tonks</b></font>)</div>Miss Tonks added, spitefully.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You think she (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) had secrets?''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>Robert asked, rather eagerly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I know she (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) had,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Tonks/Tonks</b></font>)</div>replied Miss Tonks, with frosty decision; <div class="bookquote">``all manner of secrets. I wouldn't have engaged such a person as junior teacher in a respectable school, without so much as one word of recommendation from any living creature.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Tonks/Tonks</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You had no reference, then, from Miss Graham?''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>asked Robert, addressing Mrs. Vincent.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>the lady answered, with some little embarrassment; <div class="bookquote">``I waived that. Miss Graham waived the question of salary; I could not do less than waive the question of reference. She (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) quarreled with her (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) papa, she (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) told me, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) wanted to find a home away from all the people she (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) had ever known. She (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) wished to keep herself quite separate from these people. She (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) had endured so much, she (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) said, young as she (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) was, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) wanted to escape from her (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) troubles. How could I press her (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) for a reference under these circumstances, especially when I saw that she (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) was a perfect lady. You know that Lucy Graham was a perfect lady, Tonks, and it is very unkind for you to say such cruel things about my taking her (<font color='blue'><b>Tonks</b></font>) without a reference.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``When people make favorites, they are apt to be deceived in them,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Tonks</b></font>)</div>Miss Tonks answered, with icy sententiousness, and with no very perceptible relevance to the point in discussion.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I never made her (<font color='blue'><b>Tonks</b></font>) a favorite, you jealous Tonks,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Vincent/Vincent</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Vincent answered, reproachfully. <div class="bookquote">``I never said she (<font color='blue'><b>Tonks</b></font>) was as useful as you, dear. You know I never did.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, no!''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Tonks</b></font>)</div>replied Miss Tonks, with a chilling accent, <div class="bookquote">``you never said she (<font color='blue'><b>Tonks</b></font>) was useful. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tonks</b></font>) was only ornamental; a person to be shown off to visitors, and to play fantasias on the drawing-room piano.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Tonks</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then you can give me no clew to Miss Graham's previous history?''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>Robert asked, looking from the schoolmistress to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tonks</b></font>) teacher. He (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) saw very clearly that Miss Tonks bore an envious grudge against Lucy Graham--a grudge which even the lapse of time had not healed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If this woman knows anything to my lady's detriment, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) will tell it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) thought. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) will tell it only too willingly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Tonks</b></font>)</div><p/>But Miss Tonks appeared to know nothing whatever; except that Miss Graham had sometimes declared herself an ill-used creature, deceived by the baseness of mankind, and the victim of unmerited sufferings, in the way of poverty and deprivation. Beyond this, Miss Tonks could tell nothing; and although she (<font color='blue'><b>Tonks</b></font>) made the most of what she (<font color='blue'><b>Tonks</b></font>) did know, Robert soon sounded the depth of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tonks</b></font>) small stock of information.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have only one more question to ask,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) said at last. <div class="bookquote">``It is this: Did Miss Graham leave any books or knick-knacks, or any other kind of property whatever, behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>), when she (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) left your establishment?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not to my knowledge,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Vincent/Vincent</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Vincent replied.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Tonks</b></font>)</div>cried Miss Tonks, sharply. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) did leave something. She (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) left a box. It's up-stairs in my room. I've got an old bonnet in it. Would you like to see the box?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tonks</b></font>) asked, addressing Robert.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you will be so good as to allow me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) answered, <div class="bookquote">``I should very much like to see it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll fetch it down,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Tonks</b></font>)</div>said Miss Tonks. <div class="bookquote">``It's not very big.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Tonks</b></font>) ran out of the room before Mr. Audley had time to utter any polite remonstrance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How pitiless these women are to each other,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) thought, while the teacher was absent. <div class="bookquote">``This one knows intuitively that there is some danger to the other lurking beneath my questions. She (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) sniffs the coming trouble to her (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) fellow female creature, and rejoices in it, and would take any pains to help me. What a world it is, and how these women take life out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) hands. Helen Maldon, Lady Audley, Clara Talboys, and now Miss Tonks--all womankind from beginning to end.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Tonks</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Tonks re-entered while the young barrister was meditating upon the infamy of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tonks</b></font>) sex. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tonks</b></font>) carried a dilapidated paper-covered bonnet-box, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Tonks</b></font>) submitted to Robert's inspection.

<p/>Mr. Audley knelt down to examine the scraps of railway labels and addresses which were pasted here and there upon the box. It had been battered upon a great many different lines of railway, and had evidently traveled considerably. Many of the labels had been torn off, but fragments of some of them remained, and upon one yellow scrap of paper Robert read the letters, TURI.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The box has been to Italy,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) thought. <div class="bookquote">``Those are the first four letters of the word Turin, and the label is a foreign one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Miss Graham/Lucy Graham</b></font>)</div><p/>The only direction which had not been either defaced or torn away was the last, which bore the name of Miss Graham, passenger to London. Looking very closely at this label, Mr. Audley discovered that it had been pasted over another.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Will you be so good as to let me have a little water and a piece of sponge?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I want to get off this upper label. Believe me that I am justified in what I am doing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Tonks/Tonks</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Tonks ran out of the room and returned immediately with a basin of water and a sponge.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Shall I take off the label?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tonks</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, thank you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>Robert answered, coldly. <div class="bookquote">``I can do it very well myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) damped the upper label several times before he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) could loosen the edges of the paper; but after two or three careful attempts the moistened surface peeled off, without injury to the underneath address.

<p/>Miss Tonks could not contrive to read this address across Robert's shoulder, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Tonks</b></font>) exhibited considerable dexterity in her (<font color='blue'><b>Tonks</b></font>) endeavors to accomplish that object.

<p/>Mr. Audley repeated his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) operations upon the lower label, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) removed from the box, and placed very carefully between two blank leaves of his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) pocket-book.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I need intrude upon you no longer, ladies,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) said, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) had done this. <div class="bookquote">``I am extremely obliged to you for having afforded me all the information in your power. I wish you good-morning.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Vincent/Vincent</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Vincent smiled and bowed, murmuring some complacent conventionality about the delight she (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) had felt in Mr. Audley's visit. Miss Tonks, more observant, stared at the white change, which had come over the young man's face since he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had removed the upper label from the box.

<p/>Robert walked slowly away from Acacia Cottage. <div class="bookquote">``If that which I have found to-day is no evidence for a jury,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) thought, <div class="bookquote">``it is surely enough to convince my uncle that he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) has married a designing and infamous woman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER XXVII.

<p/>BEGINNING AT THE OTHER END.

<p/>Robert Audley walked slowly through the leafless grove, under the bare and shadowless trees in the gray February atmosphere, thinking as he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) went of the discovery he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) had just made.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have that in my pocket-book,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) pondered, <div class="bookquote">``which forms the connecting link between the woman whose death George Talboys read of in the Times newspaper and the woman who rules in my uncle's house. The history of Lucy Graham ends abruptly on the threshold of Mrs. Vincent's school. She (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) entered that establishment in August, 1854. The schoolmistress and her (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) assistant can tell me this but they cannot tell me whence she (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) came. They cannot give me one clew to the secrets of her (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) life from the day of her (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) birth until the day she (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) entered that house. I can go no further in this backward investigation of my lady's antecedents. What am I to do, then, if I mean to keep my promise to Clara Talboys?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) walked on for a few paces revolving this question in his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) mind, with a darker shadow than the shadows of the gathering winter twilight on his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) face, and a heavy oppression of mingled sorrow and dread weighing down his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) heart.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My duty is clear enough,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) thought--<div class="bookquote">``not the less clear because it leads me step by step, carrying ruin and desolation with me, to the home I love. I must begin at the other end--I must begin at the other end, and discover the history of Helen Talboys from the hour of George's departure until the day of the funeral in the churchyard at Ventnor.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Audley hailed a passing hansom, and drove back to his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) chambers.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) reached Figtree Court in time to write a few lines to Miss Talboys, and to post his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) letter at St. Martin's-le-Grand off before six o'clock.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It will save me a day,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) thought, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) drove to the General Post Office with this brief epistle.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) had written to Clara Talboys to inquire the name of the little seaport town in which George had met Captain Maldon and his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) daughter; for in spite of the intimacy between the two young men, Robert Audley knew very few particulars of his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) friend's brief married life.

<p/>From the hour in which George Talboys had read the announcement of his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) wife's death in the columns of the Times, he (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) had avoided all mention of the tender history which had been so cruelly broken, the familiar record which had been so darkly blotted out.

<p/>There was so much that was painful in that brief story! There was such bitter self-reproach involved in the recollection of that desertion which must have seemed so cruel to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) who waited and watched at home! Robert Audley comprehended this, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) did not wonder at his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) friend's silence. The sorrowful story had been tacitly avoided by both, and Robert was as ignorant of the unhappy history of this one year in his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) schoolfellow's life as if they had never lived together in friendly companionship in those snug Temple chambers.

<p/>The letter, written to Miss Talboys by her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) brother George, within a month of his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) marriage, was dated Harrowgate. It was at Harrowgate, therefore, Robert concluded, the young couple spent their honeymoon.

<p/>Robert Audley had requested Clara Talboys to telegraph an answer to his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) question, in order to avoid the loss of a day in the accomplishment of the investigation he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) had promised to perform.

<p/>The telegraphic answer reached Figtree Court before twelve o'clock the next day.

<p/>The name of the seaport town was Wildernsea, Yorkshire.

<p/>Within an hour of the receipt of this message, Mr. Audley arrived at the King's-cross station, and took his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) ticket for Wildernsea by an express train that started at a quarter before two.

<p/>The shrieking engine bore him (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) on the dreary northward journey, whirling him (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) over desert wastes of flat meadow-land and bare cornfields, faintly tinted with fresh sprouting green. This northern road was strange and unfamiliar to the young barrister, and the wide expanse of the wintry landscape chilled him (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) by its aspect of bare loneliness. The knowledge of the purpose of his (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) journey blighted every object upon which his (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) absent glances fixed themselves for a moment, only to wander wearily away; only to turn inward upon that far darker picture always presenting itself to his (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) anxious mind.

<p/>It was dark when the train reached the Hull terminus, but Mr. Audley's journey was not ended. Amidst a crowd of porters and scattered heaps of that incongruous and heterogeneous luggage with which travelers incumber themselves, he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) was led, bewildered and half asleep, to another train which was to convey him (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) along the branch line that swept past Wildernsea, and skirted the border of the German Ocean.

<p/>Half an hour after leaving Hull, Robert felt the briny freshness of the sea upon the breeze that blew in at the open window of the carriage, and an hour afterward the train stopped at a melancholy station, built amid a sandy desert, and inhabited by two or three gloomy officials, one of whom rung a terrific peal upon a harshly clanging bell as the train approached.

<p/>Mr. Audley was the only passenger who alighted at the dismal station. The train swept on to the gayer scenes before the barrister had time to collect his (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) senses, or to pick up the portmanteau which had been discovered with some difficulty amid a black cavern of baggage only illuminated by one lantern.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wonder whether settlers in the backwoods of America feel as solitary and strange as I feel to-night?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) thought, as he (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) stared hopelessly about him (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) in the darkness.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) called to one of the officials, and pointed to his (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) portmanteau.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Will you carry that to the nearest hotel for me?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) asked--<div class="bookquote">``that is to say, if I can get a good bed there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The man laughed as he (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) shouldered the portmanteau.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You can get thirty beds, I dare say, sir, if you wanted 'em,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``We ain't over busy at Wildernsea at this time o' year. This way, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The porter</b></font>)</div><p/>The porter opened a wooden door in the station wall, and Robert Audley found himself upon a wide bowling-green of smooth grass, which surrounded a huge, square building, that loomed darkly on him (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) through the winter's night, its black solidity only relieved by two lighted windows, far apart from each other, and glimmering redly like beacons on the darkness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This is the Victoria Hotel, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>the porter</b></font>)</div>said the porter. <div class="bookquote">``You wouldn't believe the crowds of company we have down here in the summer.''

 (<font color='red'><b>people</b></font>)</div><p/>In the face of the bare grass-plat, the tenantless wooden alcoves, and the dark windows of the hotel, it was indeed rather difficult to imagine that the place was ever gay with merry people taking pleasure in the bright summer weather; but Robert Audley declared himself willing to believe anything the porter pleased to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>), and followed his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) guide meekly to a little door at the side of the big hotel, which led into a comfortable bar, where the humbler classes of summer visitors were accommodated with such refreshments as they pleased to pay for, without running the gantlet of the prim, white-waistcoated waiters on guard at the principal entrance.

<p/>But there were very few attendants retained at the hotel in the bleak February season, and it was the landlord himself who ushered Robert into a dreary wilderness of polished mahogany tables and horsehair cushioned chairs, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) called the coffee-room.

<p/>Mr. Audley seated himself close to the wide steel fender, and stretched his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) cramped legs upon the hearth-rug, while the landlord drove the poker into the vast pile of coal, and sent a ruddy blaze roaring upward through the chimney.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you would prefer a private room, sir--''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>the man began.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, thank you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>said Robert, indifferently; <div class="bookquote">``this room seems quite private enough just now. If you will order me a mutton chop and a pint of sherry, I shall be obliged.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And I shall be still more obliged if you will favor me with a few minutes' conversation before you do so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``With very great pleasure, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>the landlord answered, good-naturedly. <div class="bookquote">``We see so very little company at this season of the year, that we are only too glad to oblige those gentlemen who do visit us. Any information which I can afford you respecting the neighborhood of Wildernsea and its attractions,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>added the landlord, unconsciously quoting a small hand-book of the watering-place which he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) sold in the bar, <div class="bookquote">``I shall be most happy to--''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I don't want to know anything about the neighborhood of Wildernsea,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>interrupted Robert, with a feeble protest against the landlord's volubility. <div class="bookquote">``I want to ask you a few questions about some people who once lived here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the inhabitants</b></font>)</div><p/>The landlord bowed and smiled, with an air which implied his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) readiness to recite the biographies of all the inhabitants of the little seaport, if required by Mr. Audley to do so.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How many years have you lived here?''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>Robert asked, taking his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) memorandum book from his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) pocket. <div class="bookquote">``Will it annoy you if I make notes of your replies to my questions?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not at all, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>replied the landlord, with a pompous enjoyment of the air of solemnity and importance which pervaded this business. <div class="bookquote">``Any information which I can afford that is likely to be of ultimate value--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, thank you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>Robert murmured, interrupting the flow of words. <div class="bookquote">``You have lived here--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Six years, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Since the year fifty-three?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Since November, in the year fifty-two, sir. I was in business at Hull prior to that time. This house was only completed in the October before I entered it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you remember a lieutenant in the navy, on half-pay, I believe, at that time, called Maldon?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Captain Maldon, sir?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, commonly called Captain Maldon. I see you do remember him (<font color='blue'><b>Maldon</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir. Captain Maldon was one of our best customers. He (<font color='blue'><b>Maldon</b></font>) used to spend his (<font color='blue'><b>Maldon</b></font>) evenings in this very room, though the walls were damp at that time, and we weren't able to paper the place for nearly a twelvemonth afterward. His (<font color='blue'><b>Maldon</b></font>) daughter married a young officer that came here with his (<font color='blue'><b>Maldon</b></font>) regiment, at Christmas time in fifty-two. They were married here, sir, and they traveled on the Continent for six months, and came back here again. But the gentleman ran away to Australia, and left the lady, a week or two after her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) baby was born. The business made quite a sensation in Wildernsea, sir, and Mrs.--Mrs.--I forgot the name--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Talboys,''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>suggested Robert.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``To be sure, sir, Mrs. Talboys. Mrs. Talboys was very much pitied by the Wildernsea folks, sir, I was going to say, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) was very pretty, and had such nice winning ways that she (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) was a favorite with everybody who knew her (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Can you tell me how long Mr. Maldon and his (<font color='blue'><b>Maldon</b></font>) daughter remained at Wildernsea after Mr. Talboys left them?''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>Robert asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well--no, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>answered the landlord, after a few moments' deliberation. <div class="bookquote">``I can't say exactly how long it was. I know Mr. Maldon used to sit here in this very parlor, and tell people how badly his (<font color='blue'><b>Maldon</b></font>) daughter had been treated, and how he (<font color='blue'><b>Maldon</b></font>)'d been deceived by a young man he (<font color='blue'><b>Maldon</b></font>)'d put so much confidence in; but I can't say how long it was before he (<font color='blue'><b>Maldon</b></font>) left Wildernsea. But Mrs. Barkamb could tell you, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>added the landlord, briskly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Barkamb.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Mrs. Barkamb is the person who owns No. 17 North Cottages, the house in which Mr. Maldon and his (<font color='blue'><b>Maldon</b></font>) daughter lived. She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>)'s a nice, civil spoken, motherly woman, sir, and I'm sure she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>)'ll tell you anything you may want to know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you, I will call upon Mrs. Barkamb to-morrow. Stay--one more question. Should you recognize Mrs. Talboys if you were to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly, sir. As sure as I should recognize one of my own daughters.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div><p/>Robert Audley wrote Mrs. Barkamb's address in his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) pocket-book, ate his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) solitary dinner, drank a couple of glasses of sherry, smoked a cigar, and then retired to the apartment in which a fire had been lighted for his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) comfort.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) soon fell asleep, worn out with the fatigue of hurrying from place to place during the last two days; but his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) slumber was not a heavy one, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) heard the disconsolate moaning of the wind upon the sandy wastes, and the long waves rolling in monotonously upon the flat shore. Mingling with these dismal sounds, the melancholy thoughts engendered by his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) joyless journey repeated themselves in never-varying succession in the chaos of his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) slumbering brain, and made themselves into visions of things that never had been and never could be upon this earth, but which had some vague relation to real events remembered by the sleeper.

<p/>In those troublesome dreams he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) saw Audley Court, rooted up from amidst the green pastures and the shady hedgerows of Essex, standing bare and unprotected upon that desolate northern shore, threatened by the rapid rising of a boisterous sea, whose waves seemed gathering upward to descend and crush the house he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) loved. As the hurrying waves rolled nearer and nearer to the stately mansion, the sleeper saw a pale, starry face looking out of the silvery foam, and knew that it was my lady, transformed into a mermaid, beckoning his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) uncle to destruction. Beyond that rising sea great masses of cloud, blacker than the blackest ink, more dense than the darkest night, lowered upon the dreamer's eye; but as he (<font color='blue'><b>dreamer</b></font>) looked at the dismal horizon the storm-clouds slowly parted, and from a narrow rent in the darkness a ray of light streamed out upon the hideous waves, which slowly, very slowly, receded, leaving the old mansion safe and firmly rooted on the shore.

<p/>Robert awoke with the memory of this dream in his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) mind, and a sensation of physical relief, as if some heavy weight, which had oppressed him (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) all the night, had been lifted from his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) breast.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) fell asleep again, and did not awake until the broad winter sunlight shone upon the window-blind, and the shrill voice of the chambermaid at his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) door announced that it was half-past eight o'clock. At a quarter-before ten he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) had left Victoria Hotel, and was making his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) way along the lonely platform in front of a row of shadowless houses that faced the sea.

<p/>This row of hard, uncompromising, square-built habitations stretched away to the little harbor, in which two or three merchant vessels and a couple of colliers were anchored. Beyond the harbor there loomed, gray and cold upon the wintry horizon, a dismal barrack, parted from the Wildernsea houses by a narrow creek, spanned by an iron drawbridge. The scarlet coat of the sentinel who walked backward and forward between two cannons, placed at remote angles before the barrack wall, was the only scrap of color that relieved the neutral-tinted picture of the gray stone houses and the leaden sea.

<p/>On one side of the harbor a long stone pier stretched out far away into the cruel loneliness of the sea, as if built for the especial accommodation of some modern Timon, too misanthropical to be satisfied even with the solitude of Wildernsea, and anxious to get still further away from his (<font color='blue'><b>Timon</b></font>) fellow-creatures.

<p/>It was on that pier George Talboys had first met his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) wife, under the blazing glory of a midsummer sky, and to the music of a braying band. It was there that the young cornet had first yielded to that sweet delusion, that fatal infatuation which had exercised so dark an influence upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) after-life.

<p/>Robert looked savagely at this solitary watering-place--the shabby seaport.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is such a place as this,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) thought, <div class="bookquote">``that works a strong man's ruin. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) comes here, heart whole and happy, with no better experience of women than is to be learned at a flower-show or in a ball-room; with no more familiar knowledge of the creature than he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has of the far-away satellites or the remoter planets; with a vague notion that she (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) is a whirling teetotum in pink or blue gauze, or a graceful automaton for the display of milliners' manufacture. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) comes to some place of this kind, and the universe is suddenly narrowed into about half a dozen acres; the mighty scheme of creation is crushed into a bandbox. The far-away creatures whom he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had seen floating about him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), beautiful and indistinct, are brought under his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) very nose; and before he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has time to recover his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) bewilderment, hey presto, the witchcraft has begun; the magic circle is drawn around him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)! the spells are at work, the whole formula of sorcery is in full play, and the victim is as powerless to escape as the marble-legged prince in the Eastern story.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Ruminating in this wise, Robert Audley reached the house to which he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) had been directed as the residence of Mrs. Barkamb. He (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) was admitted immediately by a prim, elderly servant, who ushered him (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) into a sitting-room as prim and elderly-looking as herself. Mrs. Barkamb, a comfortable matron of about sixty years of age, was sitting in an arm-chair before a bright handful of fire in the shining grate. An elderly terrier, whose black-and-tan coat was thickly sprinkled with gray, reposed in Mrs. Barkamb's lap. Every object in the quiet sitting-room had an elderly aspect of simple comfort and precision, which is the evidence of outward repose.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I should like to live here,''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>Robert thought, <div class="bookquote">``and watch the gray sea slowly rolling over the gray sand under the still, gray sky. I should like to live here, and tell the beads upon my rosary, and repent and rest.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) seated himself in the arm-chair opposite Mrs. Barkamb, at that lady's invitation, and placed his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) hat upon the ground. The elderly terrier descended from his (<font color='blue'><b>terrier</b></font>) mistress' lap to bark at and otherwise take objection to this hat.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You were wishing, I suppose, sir, to take one--be quiet, Dash--one of the cottages,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Barkamb</b></font>)</div>suggested Mrs. Barkamb, whose mind ran in one narrow groove, and whose life during the last twenty years had been an unvarying round of house-letting.

<p/>Robert Audley explained the purpose of his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) visit.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I come to ask one simple question,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) said, in conclusion, <div class="bookquote">``I wish to discover the exact date of Mrs. Talboys' departure from Wildernsea. The proprietor of the Victoria Hotel informed me that you were the most likely person to afford me that information.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Barkamb deliberated for some moments.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can give you the date of Captain Maldon's departure,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Barkamb</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``for he (<font color='blue'><b>Maldon</b></font>) left No. 17 considerably in my debt, and I have the whole business in black and white; but with regard to Mrs. Talboys--''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Barkamb paused for a few moments before resuming.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are aware that Mrs. Talboys left rather abruptly?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Barkamb</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I was not aware of that fact.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed! Yes, she (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) left abruptly, poor little woman! She (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) tried to support herself after her (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) husband's desertion by giving music lessons; she (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) was a very brilliant pianist, and succeeded pretty well, I believe. But I suppose her (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) father took her (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) money from her (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>), and spent it in public houses. However that might be, they had a very serious misunderstanding one night; and the next morning Mrs. Talboys left Wildernsea, leaving her (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) little boy, who was out at nurse in the neighborhood.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you cannot tell me the date of her (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) leaving?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm afraid not,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Barkamb</b></font>)</div>answered Mrs. Barkamb; <div class="bookquote">``and yet, stay. Captain Maldon wrote to me upon the day his (<font color='blue'><b>Maldon</b></font>) daughter left. He (<font color='blue'><b>Maldon</b></font>) was in very great distress, poor old gentleman, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Maldon</b></font>) always came to me in his (<font color='blue'><b>Maldon</b></font>) troubles. If I could find that letter, it might be dated, you know--mightn't it, now?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Barkamb</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Audley said that it was only probable the letter was dated.

<p/>Mrs. Barkamb retired to a table in the window on which stood an old-fashioned mahogany desk, lined with green baize, and suffering from a plethora of documents, which oozed out of it in every direction. Letters, receipts, bills, inventories and tax-papers were mingled in hopeless confusion; and among these Mrs. Barkamb set to work to search for Captain Maldon's letter.

<p/>Mr. Audley waited very patiently, watching the gray clouds sailing across the gray sky, the gray vessels gliding past upon the gray sea.

<p/>After about ten minutes' search, and a great deal of rustling, crackling, folding and unfolding of the papers, Mrs. Barkamb uttered an exclamation of triumph.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've got the letter,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Barkamb</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``and there's a note inside it from Mrs. Talboys.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Robert Audley's pale face flushed a vivid crimson as he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) stretched out his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) hand to receive the papers.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The persons who stole Helen Maldon's love-letters from George's trunk in my chambers might have saved themselves the trouble,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) thought.

<p/>The letter from the old lieutenant was not long, but almost every other word was underscored.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My generous friend,''  (<font color='red'><b>the writer</b></font>)</div>the writer began--Mr. Maldon had tried the lady's generosity pretty severely during his (<font color='blue'><b>Maldon</b></font>) residence in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) house, rarely paying his (<font color='blue'><b>Maldon</b></font>) rent until threatened with the intruding presence of the broker's man--``I am in the depths of despair. My daughter has left me! You may imagine my feelings! We had a few words last night upon the subject of money matters, which subject has always been a disagreeable one between us, and on rising this morning I found I was deserted! The enclosed from Helen was waiting for me on the parlor table.

<p/>``Yours in distraction and despair,

<p/>``HENRY MALDON.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``NORTH COTTAGES, August 16th, 1854.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Talboys/Mrs. George Talboys/Mrs. George</b></font>)</div><p/>The note from Mrs. Talboys was still more brief. It began abruptly thus:

<p/>``I am weary of my life here, and wish, if I can, to find a new one. I go out into the world, dissevered from every link which binds me to the hateful past, to seek another home and another fortune. Forgive me if I have been fretful, capricious, changeable. You should forgive me, for you know why I have been so. You know the secret which is the key to my life.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``HELEN TALBOYS.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div><p/>These lines were written in a hand that Robert Audley knew only too well.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) sat for a long time pondering silently over the letter written by Helen Talboys.

<p/>What was the meaning of those two last sentences--<div class="bookquote">``You should forgive me, for you know why I have been so. You know the secret which is the key to my life?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) wearied his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) brain in endeavoring to find a clew to the signification of these two sentences. He (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) could remember nothing, nor could he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) imagine anything that would throw a light upon their meaning. The date of Helen's departure, according to Mr. Maldon's letter, was the 16th of August, 1854. Miss Tonks had declared that Lucy Graham entered the school at Crescent Villas upon the 17th or 18th of August in the same year. Between the departure of Helen Talboys from the Yorkshire watering-place and the arrival of Lucy Graham at the Brompton school, not more than eight-and-forty hours could have elapsed. This made a very small link in the chain of circumstantial evidence, perhaps; but it was a link, nevertheless, and it fitted neatly into its place.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Did Mr. Maldon hear from his (<font color='blue'><b>Maldon</b></font>) daughter after she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) had left Wildernsea?''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>Robert asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I believe he (<font color='blue'><b>Maldon</b></font>) did hear from her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Barkamb</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Barkamb answered; <div class="bookquote">``but I didn't see much of the old gentleman after that August. I was obliged to sell him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) up in November, poor fellow, for he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) owed me fifteen months' rent; and it was only by selling his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) poor little bits of furniture that I could get him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) out of my place. We parted very good friends, in spite of my sending in the brokers; and the old gentleman went to London with the child, who was scarcely a twelvemonth old.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Barkamb</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Barkamb had nothing more to tell, and Robert had no further questions to ask. He (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) requested permission to retain the two letters written by the lieutenant and his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) daughter, and left the house with them in his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) pocket-book.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) walked straight back to the hotel, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) called for a time-table. An express for London left Wildernsea at a quarter past one. Robert sent his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) portmanteau to the station, paid his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) bill, and walked up and down the stone terrace fronting the sea, waiting for the starting of the train.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have traced the histories of Lucy Graham and Helen Talboys to a vanishing point,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) thought; <div class="bookquote">``my next business is to discover the history of the woman who lies buried in Ventnor churchyard.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER XXVIII.

<p/>HIDDEN IN THE GRAVE.

<p/>Upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) return from Wildernsea, Robert Audley found a letter from his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) Cousin Alicia, awaiting him (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) at his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) chambers.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Papa is much better,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>the young lady wrote, <div class="bookquote">``and is very anxious to have you at the Court. For some inexplicable reason, my stepmother has taken it into her (<font color='blue'><b>stepmother</b></font>) head that your presence is extremely desirable, and worries me with her (<font color='blue'><b>stepmother</b></font>) frivolous questions about your movements. So pray come without delay, and set these people at rest. Your affectionate cousin, A.A.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So my lady is anxious to know my movements,''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>thought Robert Audley, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) sat brooding and smoking by his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) lonely fireside. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) is anxious; and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) questions her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) step-daughter in that pretty, childlike manner which has such a bewitching air of innocent frivolity. Poor little creature; poor unhappy little golden-haired sinner; the battle between us seems terribly unfair. Why doesn't she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) run away while there is still time? I have given her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) fair warning, I have shown her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) my cards, and worked openly enough in this business, Heaven knows. Why doesn't she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) run away?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) repeated this question again and again as he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) filled and emptied his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) meerschaum, surrounding himself with the blue vapor from his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) pipe until he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) looked like some modern magician seated in his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) laboratory.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why doesn't she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) run away? I would bring no needless shame upon that house, of all other houses upon this wide earth. I would only do my duty to my missing friend, and to that brave and generous man who has pledged his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) faith to a worthless woman. Heaven knows I have no wish to punish. Heaven knows I was never born to be the avenger of guilt or the persecutor of the guilty. I only wish to do my duty. I will give her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) one more warning, a full and fair one, and then--''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) thoughts wandered away to that gloomy prospect in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) saw no gleam of brightness to relieve the dull, black obscurity that encompassed the future, shutting in his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) pathway on every side, and spreading a dense curtain around and about him (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>), which Hope was powerless to penetrate. He (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) was forever haunted by the vision of his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) uncle's anguish, forever tortured by the thought of that ruin and desolation which, being brought about by his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) instrumentality, would seem in a manner his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) handiwork. But amid all, and through all, Clara Talboys, with an imperious gesture, beckoned him (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) onward to her (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) brother's unknown grave.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Shall I go down to Southampton,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) thought, <div class="bookquote">``and endeavor to discover the history of the woman who died at Ventnor? Shall I work underground, bribing the paltry assistants in that foul conspiracy, until I find my way to the thrice guilty principal? No! not till I have tried other means of discovering the truth. Shall I go to that miserable old man, and charge him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) share in the shameful trick which I believe to have been played upon my poor friend? No; I will not torture that terror-stricken wretch as I tortured him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) a few weeks ago. I will go straight to that arch-conspirator, and will tear away the beautiful veil under which she (<font color='blue'><b>wretch</b></font>) hides her (<font color='blue'><b>wretch</b></font>) wickedness, and will wring from her (<font color='blue'><b>wretch</b></font>) the secret of my friend's fate, and banish her (<font color='blue'><b>wretch</b></font>) forever from the house which her (<font color='blue'><b>wretch</b></font>) presence has polluted.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) started early the next morning for Essex, and reached Audley before eleven o'clock.

<p/>Early as it was, my lady was out. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had driven to Chelmsford upon a shopping expedition with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) step-daughter. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had several calls to make in the neighborhood of the town, and was not likely to return until dinner-time. Sir Michael's health was very much improved, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) would come down stairs in the afternoon. Would Mr. Audley go to his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) uncle's room?

<p/>No; Robert had no wish to meet that generous kinsman. What could he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) say to him (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>)? How could he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) smooth the way to the trouble that was to come?--how soften the cruel blow of the great grief that was preparing for that noble and trusting heart?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If I could forgive her (<font color='blue'><b>wretch</b></font>) the wrong done to my friend,''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>Robert thought, <div class="bookquote">``I should still abhor her (<font color='blue'><b>wretch</b></font>) for the misery her (<font color='blue'><b>wretch</b></font>) guilt must bring upon the man who has believed in her (<font color='blue'><b>wretch</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) told his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) uncle's servant that he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) would stroll into the village, and return before dinner. He (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) walked slowly away from the Court, wandering across the meadows between his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) uncle's house and the village, purposeless and indifferent, with the great trouble and perplexity of his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) life stamped upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) face and reflected in his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) manner.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I will go into the churchyard,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) thought, <div class="bookquote">``and stare at the tombstones. There is nothing I can do that will make me more gloomy than I am.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) was in those very meadows through which he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) had hurried from Audley Court to the station upon the September day in which George Talboys had disappeared. He (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) looked at the pathway by which he (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) had gone upon that day, and remembered his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) unaccustomed hurry, and the vague feeling of terror which had taken possession of him (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) immediately upon losing sight of his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) friend.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why did that unaccountable terror seize upon me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) thought. <div class="bookquote">``Why was it that I saw some strange mystery in my friend's disappearance? Was it a monition, or a monomania? What if I am wrong after all? What if this chain of evidence which I have constructed link by link, is woven out of my own folly? What if this edifice of horror and suspicion is a mere collection of crotchets--the nervous fancies of a hypochondriacal bachelor? Mr. Harcourt Talboys sees no meaning in the events out of which I have made myself a horrible mystery. I lay the separate links of the chain before him (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) cannot recognize their fitness. He (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) is unable to put them together. Oh, my God, if it should be in myself all this time that the misery lies; if--''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) smiled bitterly, and shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``I have the handwriting in my pocket-book which is the evidence of the conspiracy,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) thought. <div class="bookquote">``It remains for me to discover the darker half of my lady's secret.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) avoided the village, still keeping to the meadows. The church lay a little way back from the straggling High street, and a rough wooden gate opened from the churchyard into a broad meadow, that was bordered by a running stream, and sloped down into a grassy valley dotted by groups of cattle.

<p/>Robert slowly ascended the narrow hillside pathway leading up to the gate in the churchyard. The quiet dullness of the lonely landscape harmonized with his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) own gloom. The solitary figure of an old man hobbling toward a stile at the further end of the wide meadow was the only human creature visible upon the area over which the young barrister looked. The smoke slowly ascending from the scattered houses in the long High street was the only evidence of human life. The slow progress of the hands of the old clock in the church steeple was the only token by which a traveler could perceive that a sluggish course of rustic life had not come to a full stop in the village of Audley.

<p/>Yes, there was one other sign. As Robert opened the gate of the churchyard, and strolled listessly into the little inclosure, he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) became aware of the solemn music of an organ, audible through a half-open window in the steeple.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) stopped and listened to the slow harmonies of a dreamy melody that sounded like an extempore composition of an accomplished player.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who would have believed that Audley church could boast such an organ?''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>thought Robert. <div class="bookquote">``When last I was here, the national schoolmaster used to accompany his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) children by a primitive performance of common chords. I didn't think the old organ had such music in it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) lingered at the gate, not caring to break the lazy spell woven about him (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) by the monotonous melancholy of the organist's performance. The tones of the instrument, now swelling to their fullest power, now sinking to a low, whispering softness, floated toward him (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) upon the misty winter atmosphere, and had a soothing influence, that seemed to comfort him (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) trouble.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) closed the gate softly, and crossed the little patch of gravel before the door of the church. The door had been left ajar--by the organist, perhaps. Robert Audley pushed it open, and walked into the square porch, from which a flight of narrow stone steps wound upward to the organ-loft and the belfry. Mr. Audley took off his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) hat, and opened the door between the porch and the body of the church. He (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) stepped softly into the holy edifice, which had a damp, moldy smell upon week-days. He (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) walked down the narrow aisle to the altar-rails, and from that point of observation took a survey of the church. The little gallery was exactly opposite to him (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>), but the scanty green curtains before the organ were closely drawn, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) could not get a glimpse of the player.

<p/>The music still rolled on. The organist had wandered into a melody of Mendelssohn's, a strain whose dreamy sadness went straight to Robert's heart. He (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) loitered in the nooks and corners of the church, examining the dilapidated memorials of the well-nigh forgotten dead, and listening to the music.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If my poor friend, George Talboys, had died in my arms, and I had buried him (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) in this quiet church, in one corner of the vaults over which I tread to-day, how much anguish of mind, vacillation and torment I might have escaped,''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>thought Robert Audley, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) read the faded inscriptions upon tablets of discolored marble; <div class="bookquote">``I should have known his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) fate--I should have known his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) fate! Ah, how much there would have been in that. It is this miserable uncertainty, this horrible suspicion which has poisoned my very life.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) watch.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Half-past one,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) muttered. <div class="bookquote">``I shall have to wait four or five dreary hours before my lady comes home from her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) morning calls--her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) pretty visits of ceremony or friendliness. Good Heaven! what an actress this woman is. What an arch trickster--what an all-accomplished deceiver. But she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) shall play her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) pretty comedy no longer under my uncle's roof. I have diplomatized long enough. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) has refused to accept an indirect warning. To-night I will speak plainly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div><p/>The music of the organ ceased, and Robert heard the closing of the instrument.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll have a look at this new organist,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) thought, <div class="bookquote">``who can afford to bury his (<font color='blue'><b>organist</b></font>) talents at Audley, and play Mendelssohn's finest fugues for a stipend of sixteen pounds a year.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) lingered in the porch, waiting for the organist to descend the awkward little stair-case. In the weary trouble of his (<font color='blue'><b>organist</b></font>) mind, and with the prospect of getting through the five hours in the best way he (<font color='blue'><b>organist</b></font>) could, Mr. Audley was glad to cultivate any diversion of thought, however idle. He (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) therefore freely indulged his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) curiosity about the new organist.

<p/>The first person who appeared upon the steep stone steps was a boy in corduroy trousers and a dark linen smock-frock, who shambled down the stairs with a good deal of unnecessary clatter of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) hobnailed shoes, and who was red in the face from the exertion of blowing the bellows of the old organ. Close behind this boy came a young lady, very plainly dressed in a black silk gown and a large gray shawl, who started and turned pale at sight of Mr. Audley.

<p/>This young lady was Clara Talboys.

<p/>Of all people in the world she (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) was the last whom Robert either expected or wished to see. She (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) had told him (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) was going to pay a visit to some friends who lived in Essex; but the county is a wide one, and the village of Audley one of the most obscure and least frequented spots in the whole of its extent. That the sister of his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) lost friend should be here--here where she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) could watch his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) every action, and from those actions deduce the secret workings of his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) mind, tracing his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) doubts home to their object, made a complication of his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) difficulties that he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) could never have anticipated. It brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) back to that consciousness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) own helplessness, in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) had exclaimed:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A hand that is stronger than my own is beckoning me onward on the dark road that leads to my lost friend's unknown grave.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Clara Talboys was the first to speak.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are surprised to see me here, Mr. Audley,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very much surprised.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I told you that I was coming to Essex. I left home day before yesterday. I was leaving home when I received your telegraphic message. The friend with whom I am staying is Mrs. Martyn, the wife of the new rector of Mount Stanning. I came down this morning to see the village and church, and as Mrs. Martyn had to pay a visit to the school with the curate and his (<font color='blue'><b>rector</b></font>) wife, I stopped here and amused myself by trying the old organ. I was not aware till I came here that there was a village called Audley. The place takes its name from your family, I suppose?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I believe so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>Robert answered, wondering at the lady's calmness, in contradistinction to his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) own embarrassment. <div class="bookquote">``I have a vague recollection of hearing the story of some ancestor who was called Audley of Audley in the reign of Edward the Fourth. The tomb inside the rails near the altar belongs to one of the knights of Audley, but I have never taken the trouble to remember his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) achievements. Are you going to wait here for your friends, Miss Talboys?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; they are to return here for me after they have finished their rounds.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you go back to Mount Stanning with them this afternoon?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div><p/>Robert stood with his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) hat in his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) hand, looking absently out at the tombstones and the low wall of the church yard. Clara Talboys watched his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) pale face, haggard under the deepening shadow that had rested upon it so long.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You have been ill since I saw you last, Mr. Audley,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) said, in a low voice, that had the same melodious sadness as the notes of the old organ under her (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) touch.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I have not been ill; I have been only harassed, wearied by a hundred doubts and perplexities.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) was thinking as he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) spoke to her (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>):

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How much does she (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) guess? How much does she (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) suspect?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) had told the story of George's disappearance and of his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) own suspicions, suppressing only the names of those concerned in the mystery; but what if this girl should fathom this slender disguise, and discover for herself that which he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) had chosen to withhold.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) grave eyes were fixed upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) face, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) knew that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was trying to read the innermost secrets of his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) mind.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What am I in her (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) hands?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) thought. <div class="bookquote">``What am I in the hands of this woman, who has my lost friend's face and the manner of Pallas Athene. She (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) reads my pitiful, vacillating soul, and plucks the thoughts out of my heart with the magic of her (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) solemn brown eyes. How unequal the fight must be between us, and how can I ever hope to conquer against the strength of her (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) beauty and her (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) wisdom?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Audley was clearing his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) throat preparatory to bidding his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) beautiful companion good-morning, and making his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) escape from the thraldom of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) presence into the lonely meadow outside the churchyard, when Clara Talboys arrested him (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) by speaking upon that very subject which he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) was most anxious to avoid.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You promised to write to me, Mr. Audley,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``if you made any discovery which carried you nearer to the mystery of my brother's disappearance. You have not written to me, and I imagine, therefore, that you have discovered nothing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Robert Audley was silent for some moments. How could he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) answer this direct question?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The chain of circumstantial evidence which unites the mystery of your brother's fate with the person whom I suspect,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) said, after a pause, <div class="bookquote">``is formed of very slight links. I think that I have added another link to that chain since I saw you in Dorsetshire.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you refuse to tell me what it is that you have discovered?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Only until I have discovered more.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought from your message that you were going to Wildernsea.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have been there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed! It was there that you made some discovery, then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It was,''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>answered Robert. <div class="bookquote">``You must remember, Miss Talboys that the sole ground upon which my suspicions rest is the identity of two individuals who have no apparent connection--the identity of a person who is supposed to be dead with one who is living.

If his (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>) wife, Helen Talboys, died when the papers recorded her (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) death--if the woman who lies buried in Ventnor churchyard was indeed the woman whose name is inscribed on the headstone of the grave--I have no case, I have no clew to the mystery of your brother's fate. I am about to put this to the test. I believe that I am now in a position to play a bold game, and I believe that I shall soon arrive at the truth.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) spoke in a low voice, and with a solemn emphasis that betrayed the intensity of his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) feeling. Miss Talboys stretched out her (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) ungloved hand, and laid it in his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) own. The cold touch of that slender hand sent a shivering thrill through his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) frame.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You will not suffer my brother's fate to remain a mystery, Mr. Audley,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) said, quietly. <div class="bookquote">``I know that you will do your duty to your friend.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The rector</b></font>)</div><p/>The rector's wife and her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) two companions entered the churchyard as Clara Talboys said this. Robert Audley pressed the hand that rested in his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) own, and raised it to his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) lips.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am a lazy, good-for-nothing fellow, Miss Talboys,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``but if I could restore your brother George to life and happiness, I should care very little for any sacrifice of my own feeling, fear that the most I can do is to fathom the secret of his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) fate and in doing that I must sacrifice those who are dearer to me than myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) put on his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) hat, and hurried through the gateway leading into the field as Mrs. Martyn came up to the porch.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who is that handsome young man I caught tête-a-tête with you, Clara?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Martyn</b></font>) asked, laughing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is a Mr. Audley, a friend of my poor brother's.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed! He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) is some relation of Sir Michael Audley, I suppose?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sir Michael Audley!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, my dear; the most important personage in the parish of Audley. But we'll call at the Court in a day or two, and you shall see the baronet and his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) pretty young wife.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``His (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) young wife!''  (<font color='red'><b>Clara Talboys/Clara</b></font>)</div>replied Clara Talboys, looking earnestly at her (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) friend. <div class="bookquote">``Has Sir Michael Audley lately married, then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. He (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) was a widower for sixteen years, and married a penniless young governess about a year and a half ago. The story is quite romantic, and Lady Audley is considered the belle of the county. But come, my dear Clara, the pony is tired of waiting for us, and we've a long drive before dinner.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Clara Talboys/Clara</b></font>)</div><p/>Clara Talboys took her (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) seat in the little basket-carriage which was waiting at the principal gate of the churchyard, in the care of the boy who had blown the organ-bellows. Mrs. Martyn shook the reins, and the sturdy chestnut cob trotted off in the direction of Mount Stanning.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Will you tell me more about this Lady Audley, Fanny?''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Talboys</b></font>)</div>Miss Talboys said, after a long pause. <div class="bookquote">``I want to know all about her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>). Have you heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) maiden name?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; she (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) was a Miss Graham.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And she (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) is very pretty?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, very, very pretty. Rather a childish beauty though, with large, clear blue eyes, and pale golden ringlets, that fall in a feathery shower over her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) throat and shoulders.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Clara Talboys/Clara</b></font>)</div><p/>Clara Talboys was silent. She (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) did not ask any further questions about my lady.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) was thinking of a passage in that letter which George had written to her (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) during his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) honeymoon--a passage in which he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) said: <div class="bookquote">``My childish little wife is watching me as I write this--Ah! how I wish you could see her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), Clara! Her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) eyes are as blue and as clear as the skies on a bright summer's day, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) hair falls about her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) face like the pale golden halo you see round the head of a Madonna in an Italian picture.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER XXIX.

<p/>IN THE LIME-WALK.

<p/>Robert Audley was loitering upon the broad grass-plat in front of the Court as the carriage containing my lady and Alicia drove under the archway, and drew up at the low turret-door. Mr. Audley presented himself in time to hand the ladies out of the vehicle.

<p/>My lady looked very pretty in a delicate blue bonnet and the sables which her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) nephew had bought for her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) at St. Petersburg. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) seemed very well pleased to see Robert, and smiled most bewitchingly as she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) exquisitely gloved little hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So you have come back to us, truant?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said, laughing. <div class="bookquote">``And now that you have returned, we shall keep you prisoner. We won't let him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) run away again, will we, Alicia?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Alicia/Miss Audley/Miss Alicia</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Audley gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) head a scornful toss that shook the heavy curls under her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) cavalier hat.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have nothing to do with the movements of so erratic an individual,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Since Robert Audley has taken it into his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) head to conduct himself like some ghost-haunted hero in a German story, I have given up attempting to understand him (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Audley looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) cousin with an expression of serio-comic perplexity. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>)'s a nice girl,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) thought, <div class="bookquote">``but she (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>)'s a nuisance. I don't know how it is, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) seems more a nuisance than she (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) used to be.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) pulled his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) mustaches reflectively as he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) considered this question. His (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) mind wandered away for a few moments from the great trouble of his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) life to dwell upon this minor perplexity.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>)'s a dear girl,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) thought; <div class="bookquote">``a generous-hearted, bouncing, noble English lassie; and yet--''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) lost himself in a quagmire of doubt and difficulty. There was some hitch in his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) mind which he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) could not understand; some change in himself, beyond the change made in him (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) by his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) anxiety about George Talboys, which mystified and bewildered him (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And pray where have you been wandering during the last day or two, Mr. Audley?''  (<font color='red'><b>lady</b></font>)</div>asked my lady, as she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) lingered with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) step-daughter upon the threshold of the turret-door, waiting until Robert should be pleased to stand aside and allow them to pass. The young man started as she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) asked this question and looked up at her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) suddenly. Something in the aspect of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) bright young beauty, something in the childish innocence of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) expression, seemed to smite him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to the heart, and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face grew ghastly pale as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have been--in Yorkshire,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``at the little watering place where my poor friend George Talboys lived at the time of his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) marriage.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The white change in my lady's face was the only sign of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) having heard these words. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) smiled, a faint, sickly smile, and tried to pass her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) husband's nephew.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I must dress for dinner,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I am going to a dinner-party, Mr. Audley; please let me go in.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I must ask you to spare me half an hour, Lady Audley,''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>Robert answered, in a low voice. <div class="bookquote">``I came down to Essex on purpose to speak to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What about?''  (<font color='red'><b>lady</b></font>)</div>asked my lady.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had recovered herself from any shock which she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) might have sustained a few moments before, and it was in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) usual manner that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) asked this question. Her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) face expressed the mingled bewilderment and curiosity of a puzzled child, rather than the serious surprise of a woman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What can you want to talk to me about, Mr. Audley?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) repeated.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I will tell you when we are alone,''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>Robert said, glancing at his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) cousin, who stood a little way behind my lady, watching this confidential little dialogue.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) is in love with my step-mother's wax-doll beauty,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alicia/Miss Audley/Miss Alicia</b></font>)</div>thought Alicia, <div class="bookquote">``and it is for her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) sake he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) has become such a disconsolate object. He (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>)'s just the sort of person to fall in love with his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) aunt.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Alicia/Miss Audley/Miss Alicia</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Audley walked away to the grass-plat, turning her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) back upon Robert and my lady.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The absurd creature turned as white as a sheet when he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) thought. <div class="bookquote">``So he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) can be in love, after all. That slow lump of torpidity he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) calls his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) heart can beat, I suppose, once in a quarter of a century; but it seems that nothing but a blue-eyed wax-doll can set it going. I should have given him (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) up long ago if I'd known that his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) idea of beauty was to be found in a toy-shop.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Alicia/Miss Audley/Miss Alicia</b></font>)</div><p/>Poor Alicia crossed the grass-plat and disappeared upon the opposite side of the quadrangle, where there was a Gothic gate that communicated with the stables. I am sorry to say that Sir Michael Audley's daughter went to seek consolation from her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) dog Caesar and her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) chestnut mare Atalanta, whose loose box the young lady was in the habit of visiting every day.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Will you come into the lime-walk, Lady Audley?''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>said Robert, as his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) cousin left the garden. <div class="bookquote">``I wish to talk to you without fear of interruption or observation. I think we could choose no safer place than that. Will you come there with me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you please,''  (<font color='red'><b>lady</b></font>)</div>answered my lady. Mr. Audley could see that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was trembling, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) glanced from side to side as if looking for some outlet by which she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) might escape him (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are shivering, Lady Audley,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I am very cold. I would rather speak to you some other day, please. Let it be to-morrow, if you will. I have to dress for dinner, and I want to see Sir Michael; I have not seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) since ten o'clock this morning. Please let it be to-morrow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>There was a painful piteousness in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) tone. Heaven knows how painful to Robert's heart. Heaven knows what horrible images arose in his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) mind as he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) looked down at that fair young face and thought of the task that lay before him (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I must speak to you, Lady Audley,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``If I am cruel, it is you who have made me cruel. You might have escaped this ordeal. You might have avoided me. I gave you fair warning. But you have chosen to defy me, and it is your own folly which is to blame if I no longer spare you. Come with me. I tell you again I must speak to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>lady</b></font>)</div><p/>There was a cold determination in his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) tone which silenced my lady's objections. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) followed him (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) submissively to the little iron gate which communicated with the long garden behind the house--the garden in which a little rustic wooden bridge led across the quiet fish-pond into the lime-walk.

<p/>The early winter twilight was closing in, and the intricate tracery of the leafless branches that overarched the lonely pathway looked black against the cold gray of the evening sky. The lime-walk seemed like some cloister in this uncertain light.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why do you bring me to this horrible place to frighten me out of my poor wits?''  (<font color='red'><b>lady</b></font>)</div>cried my lady, peevishly. <div class="bookquote">``You ought to know how nervous I am.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are nervous, my lady?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, dreadfully nervous. I am worth a fortune to poor Mr. Dawson. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dawson</b></font>) is always sending me camphor, and sal volatile, and red lavender, and all kinds of abominable mixtures, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Dawson</b></font>) can't cure me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you remember what Macbeth tells his (<font color='blue'><b>Macbeth</b></font>) physician, my lady?''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>asked Robert, gravely. <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Dawson may be very much more clever than the Scottish leech, but I doubt if even he (<font color='blue'><b>Dawson</b></font>) can minister to the mind that is diseased.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who said that my mind was diseased?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Audley/LADY AUDLEY</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Lady Audley.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I say so, my lady,''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>answered Robert. <div class="bookquote">``You tell me that you are nervous, and that all the medicines your doctor can prescribe are only so much physic that might as well be thrown to the dogs. Let me be the physician to strike to the root of your malady, Lady Audley. Heaven knows that I wish to be merciful--that I would spare you as far as it is in my power to spare you in doing justice to others--but justice must be done. Shall I tell you why you are nervous in this house, my lady?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you can,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) answered, with a little laugh.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Because for you this house is haunted.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Haunted?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, haunted by the ghost of George Talboys.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div><p/>Robert Audley heard my lady's quickened breathing, he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) fancied he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) could almost hear the loud beating of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) heart as she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) walked by his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) side, shivering now and then, and with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) sable cloak wrapped tightly around her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you mean?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) cried suddenly, after a pause of some moments. <div class="bookquote">``Why do you torment me about this George Talboys, who happens to have taken it into his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) head to keep out of your way for a few months? Are you going mad, Mr. Audley, and do you select me as the victim of your monomania? What is George Talboys to me that you should worry me about him (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) was a stranger to you, my lady, was he (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) not?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Audley/LADY AUDLEY</b></font>)</div>answered Lady Audley. <div class="bookquote">``What should he (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) be but a stranger?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Shall I tell you the story of my friend's disappearance as I read that story, my lady?''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>asked Robert.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Audley/LADY AUDLEY</b></font>)</div>cried Lady Audley; <div class="bookquote">``I wish to know nothing of your friend. If he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) is dead, I am sorry for him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>). If he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) lives, I have no wish either to see him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) or to hear of him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>). Let me go in to see my husband, if you please, Mr. Audley, unless you wish to detain me in this gloomy place until I catch my death of cold.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Audley/LADY AUDLEY</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish to detain you until you have heard what I have to say, Lady Audley,''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>answered Robert, resolutely. <div class="bookquote">``I will detain you no longer than is necessary, and when you have heard me you shall take your own course of action.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well, then; pray lose no time in saying what you have to say,''  (<font color='red'><b>lady</b></font>)</div>replied my lady, carelessly. <div class="bookquote">``I promise you to attend very patiently.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``When my friend, George Talboys, returned to England,''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>Robert began, gravely, <div class="bookquote">``the thought which was uppermost in his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) mind was the thought of his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) wife.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) had deserted,''  (<font color='red'><b>lady</b></font>)</div>said my lady, quickly. <div class="bookquote">``At least,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) added, more deliberately, <div class="bookquote">``I remember your telling us something to that effect when you first told us your friend's story.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Robert Audley did not notice this observation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The thought that was uppermost in his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) mind was the thought of his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) wife,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) repeated. <div class="bookquote">``His (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) fairest hope in the future was the hope of making her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) happy, and lavishing upon her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) the pittance which he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had won by the force of his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) own strong arm in the gold-fields of Australia. I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) within a few hours of his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) reaching England, and I was a witness to the joyful pride with which he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) looked forward to his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) re-union with his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) wife. I was also a witness to the blow which struck him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) to the very heart--which changed him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) from the man he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had been to a creature as unlike that former self as one human being can be unlike another. The blow which made that cruel change was the announcement of his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) wife's death in the Times newspaper. I now believe that that announcement was a black and bitter lie.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed!''  (<font color='red'><b>lady</b></font>)</div>said my lady; <div class="bookquote">``and what reason could any one have for announcing the death of Mrs. Talboys, if Mrs. Talboys had been alive?''

 (<font color='red'><b>lady</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The lady herself might have had a reason,''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>Robert answered, quietly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What reason?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How if she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had taken advantage of George's absence to win a richer husband? How if she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had married again, and wished to throw my poor friend off the scent by this false announcement?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Audley/LADY AUDLEY</b></font>)</div><p/>Lady Audley shrugged her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) shoulders.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your suppositions are rather ridiculous, Mr. Audley,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``it is to be hoped that you have some reasonable grounds for them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have examined a file of each of the newspapers published in Chelmsford and Colchester,''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>continued Robert, without replying to my lady's last observation, <div class="bookquote">``and I find in one of the Colchester papers, dated July the 2d, 1857, a brief paragraph among numerous miscellaneous scraps of information copied from other newspapers, to the effect that a Mr. George Talboys, an English gentleman, had arrived at Sydney from the gold-fields, carrying with him (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) nuggets and gold-dust to the amount of twenty thousand pounds, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) had realized his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) property and sailed for Liverpool in the fast-sailing clipper Argus. This is a very small fact, of course, Lady Audley, but it is enough to prove that any person residing in Essex in the July of the year fifty-seven, was likely to become aware of George Talboys' return from Australia. Do you follow me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>lady</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not very clearly,''  (<font color='red'><b>lady</b></font>)</div>said my lady. <div class="bookquote">``What have the Essex papers to do with the death of Mrs. Talboys?''

I say that I believe the announcement in the Times to have been a false announcement, and a part of the conspiracy which was carried out by Helen Talboys and Lieutenant Maldon against my poor friend.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A conspiracy!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, a conspiracy concocted by an artful woman, who had speculated upon the chances of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) husband's death, and had secured a splendid position at the risk of committing a crime; a bold woman, my lady, who thought to play her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) comedy out to the end without fear of detection; a wicked woman, who did not care what misery she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) might inflict upon the honest heart of the man she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) betrayed; but a foolish woman, who looked at life as a game of chance, in which the best player was likely to hold the winning cards, forgetting that there is a Providence above the pitiful speculators, and that wicked secrets are never permitted to remain long hidden. If this woman of whom I speak had never been guilty of any blacker sin than the publication of that lying announcement in the Times newspaper, I should still hold her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) as the most detestable and despicable of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) sex--the most pitiless and calculating of human creatures. That cruel lie was a base and cowardly blow in the dark; it was the treacherous dagger-thrust of an infamous assassin.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But how do you know that the announcement was a false one?''  (<font color='red'><b>lady</b></font>)</div>asked my lady. <div class="bookquote">``You told us that you had been to Ventnor with Mr. Talboys to see his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) wife's grave. Who was it who died at Ventnor if it was not Mrs. Talboys?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, Lady Audley,''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>said Robert, <div class="bookquote">``that is a question which only two or three people can answer, and one or other of those persons shall answer it to me before long. I tell you, my lady, that I am determined to unravel the mystery of George Talboy's death. Do you think I am to be put off by feminine prevarication--by womanly trickery? No! Link by link I have put together the chain of evidence, which wants but a link here and there to be complete in its terrible strength. Do you think I will suffer myself to be baffled? Do you think I shall fail to discover those missing links? No, Lady Audley, I shall not fail, for I know where to look for them! There is a fair-haired woman at Southampton--a woman called Plowson, who has some share in the secrets of the father of my friend's wife. I have an idea that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) can help me to discover the history of the woman who lies buried in Ventnor churchyard, and I will spare no trouble in making that discovery, unless--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Unless what?''  (<font color='red'><b>lady</b></font>)</div>asked my lady, eagerly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Unless the woman I wish to save from degradation and punishment accepts the mercy I offer her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), and takes warning while there is still time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>lady</b></font>)</div><p/>My lady shrugged her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) graceful shoulders, and flashed bright defiance out of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) blue eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would be a very foolish woman if she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) suffered herself to be influenced by any such absurdity,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``You are hypochondriacal, Mr. Audley, and you must take camphor, or red lavender, or sal volatile. What can be more ridiculous than this idea which you have taken into your head? You lose your friend George Talboys in rather a mysterious manner--that is to say, that gentleman chooses to leave England without giving you due notice. What of that? You confess that he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) became an altered man after his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) wife's death. He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) grew eccentric and misanthropical; he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) affected an utter indifference as to what became of him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>). What more likely, then, than that he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) grew tired of the monotony of civilized life, and ran away to those savage gold-fields to find a distraction for his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) grief? It is rather a romantic story, but by no means an uncommon one. But you are not satisfied with this simple interpretation of your friend's disappearance, and you build up some absurd theory of a conspiracy which has no existence except in your own overheated brain. Helen Talboys is dead. The Times newspaper declares she (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) is dead. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) own father tells you that she (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) is dead. The headstone of the grave in Ventnor churchyard bears record of her (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) death. By what right,''  (<font color='red'><b>lady</b></font>)</div>cried my lady, her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) voice rising to that shrill and piercing tone peculiar to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) when affected by any intense agitation--<div class="bookquote">``by what right, Mr. Audley, do you come to me, and torment me about George Talboys--by what right do you dare to say that his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) wife is still alive?''

 (<font color='red'><b>lady</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``By the right of circumstantial evidence, Lady Audley,''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>answered Robert--<div class="bookquote">``by the right of that circumstantial evidence which will sometimes fix the guilt of a man's murder upon that person who, on the first hearing of the case, seems of all other men the most unlikely to be guilty.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What circumstantial evidence?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The evidence of time and place. The evidence of handwriting. When Helen Talboys left her (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) father's at Wildernsea, she (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) left a letter behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>)--a letter in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) declared that she (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) was weary of her (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) old life, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) wished to seek a new home and a new fortune. That letter is in my possession.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Shall I tell you whose handwriting resembles that of Helen Talboys so closely, that the most dexterous expert could perceive no distinction between the two?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A resemblance between the handwriting of two women is no very uncommon circumstance now-a-days,''  (<font color='red'><b>lady</b></font>)</div>replied my lady carelessly. <div class="bookquote">``I could show you the caligraphies of half-a-dozen female correspondents, and defy you to discover any great difference in them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But what if the handwriting is a very uncommon one, presenting marked peculiarities by which it may be recognized among a hundred?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, in that case the coincidence is rather curious,''  (<font color='red'><b>lady</b></font>)</div>answered my lady; <div class="bookquote">``but it is nothing more than a coincidence. You cannot deny the fact of Helen Talboys death on the ground that her (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) handwriting resembles that of some surviving person.''

 (<font color='red'><b>lady</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But if a series of such coincidences lead up to the same point,''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>said Robert. <div class="bookquote">``Helen Talboys left her (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) father's house, according to the declaration in her (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) own handwriting, because she (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) was weary of her (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) old life, and wished to begin a new one. Do you know what I infer from this?''

 (<font color='red'><b>lady</b></font>)</div><p/>My lady shrugged her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) shoulders.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have not the least idea,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``and as you have detained me in this gloomy place nearly half-an-hour, I must beg that you will release me, and let me go and dress for dinner.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, Lady Audley,''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>answered Robert, with a cold sternness that was so strange to him (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) as to transform him (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) into another creature--a pitiless embodiment of justice, a cruel instrument of retribution--<div class="bookquote">``no, Lady Audley,''  (<font color='red'><b>another creature</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) repeated, <div class="bookquote">``I have told you that womanly prevarication will not help you; I tell you now that defiance will not serve you. I have dealt fairly with you, and have given you fair warning. I gave you indirect notice of your danger two months ago.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you mean?''  (<font color='red'><b>lady</b></font>)</div>asked my lady, suddenly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You did not choose to take that warning, Lady Audley,''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>pursued Robert, <div class="bookquote">``and the time has come in which I must speak very plainly to you. Do you think the gifts which you have played against fortune are to hold you exempt from retribution? No, my lady, your youth and beauty, your grace and refinement, only make the horrible secret of your life more horrible. I tell you that the evidence against you wants only one link to be strong enough for your condemnation, and that link shall be added. Helen Talboys never returned to her (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) father's house. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) deserted that poor old father, she (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) went away from his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) humble shelter with the declared intention of washing her (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) hands of that old life. What do people generally do when they wish to begin a new existence--to start for a second time in the race of life, free from the incumbrances that had fettered their first journey. They change their names, Lady Audley. Helen Talboys deserted her (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) infant son--she (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) went away from Wildernsea with the predetermination of sinking her (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) identity. She (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) disappeared as Helen Talboys upon the 16th of August, 1854, and upon the 17th of that month she (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) reappeared as Lucy Graham, the friendless girl who undertook a profitless duty in consideration of a home in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) was asked no questions.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are mad, Mr. Audley!''  (<font color='red'><b>lady</b></font>)</div>cried my lady. <div class="bookquote">``You are mad, and my husband shall protect me from your insolence. What if this Helen Talboys ran away from her (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) home upon one day, and I entered my employer's house upon the next, what does that prove?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``By itself, very little,''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>replied Robert Audley; <div class="bookquote">``but with the help of other evidence--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What evidence?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The evidence of two labels, pasted one over the other, upon a box left by you in possession of Mrs. Vincent, the upper label bearing the name of Miss Graham, the lower that of Mrs. George Talboys.''

 (<font color='red'><b>lady</b></font>)</div><p/>My lady was silent. Robert Audley could not see her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) face in the dusk, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) could see that her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) two small hands were clasped convulsively over her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) heart, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) knew that the shot had gone home to its mark.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``God help her (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>), poor, wretched creature,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) thought. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) knows now that she (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) is lost. I wonder if the judges of the land feel as I do now when they put on the black cap and pass sentence of death upon some poor, shivering wretch, who has never done them any wrong. Do they feel a heroic fervor of virtuous indignation, or do they suffer this dull anguish which gnaws my vitals as I talk to this helpless woman?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) walked by my lady's side, silently, for some minutes. They had been pacing up and down the dim avenue, and they were now drawing near the leafless shrubbery at one end of the lime-walk--the shrubbery in which the ruined well sheltered its unheeded decay among the tangled masses of briery underwood.

<p/>A winding pathway, neglected and half-choked with weeds, led toward this well. Robert left the lime-walk, and struck into this pathway. There was more light in the shrubbery than in the avenue, and Mr. Audley wished to see my lady's face.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) did not speak until they reached the patch of rank grass beside the well. The massive brickwork had fallen away here and there, and loose fragments of masonry lay buried amidst weeds and briars. The heavy posts which had supported the wooden roller still remained, but the iron spindle had been dragged from its socket and lay a few paces from the well, rusty, discolored, and forgotten.

<p/>Robert Audley leaned against one of the moss-grown posts and looked down at my lady's face, very pale in the chill winter twilight. The moon had newly risen, a feebly luminous crescent in the gray heavens, and a faint, ghostly light mingled with the misty shadows of the declining day. My lady's face seemed like that face which Robert Audley had seen in his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) dreams looking out of the white foam-flakes on the green sea waves and luring his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) uncle to destruction.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Those two labels are in my possession, Lady Audley,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) resumed. ``I took them from the box left by you at Crescent Villas. I took them in the presence of Mrs. Vincent and Miss Tonks. Have you any proofs to offer against this evidence? You say to me, ``I am Lucy Graham and I have nothing whatever to do with Helen Talboys.<div class="bookquote">'' In that case you will produce witnesses who will declare your antecedents. Where had you been living prior to your appearance at Crescent Villas? You must have friends, relations, connections, who can come forward to prove as much as this for you? If you were the most desolate creature upon this earth, you would be able to point to someone who could identify you with the past.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Helen Talboys/Helen/HELEN TALBOYS</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>lady</b></font>)</div>cried my lady, <div class="bookquote">``if I were placed in a criminal dock I could, no doubt, bring forward witnesses to refute your absurd accusation. But I am not in a criminal dock, Mr. Audley, and I do not choose to do anything but laugh at your ridiculous folly. I tell you that you are mad! If you please to say that Helen Talboys is not dead, and that I am Helen Talboys, you may do so. If you choose to go wandering about in the places in which I have lived, and to the places in which this Mrs. Talboys has lived, you must follow the bent of your own inclination, but I would warn you that such fancies have sometimes conducted people, as apparently sane as yourself, to the life-long imprisonment of a private lunatic-asylum.''

 (<font color='red'><b>lady</b></font>)</div><p/>Robert Audley started and recoiled a few paces among the weeds and brushwood as my lady said this.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) would be capable of any new crime to shield her (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) from the consequences of the old one,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) thought. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) would be capable of using her (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) influence with my uncle to place me in a mad-house.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I do not say that Robert Audley was a coward, but I will admit that a shiver of horror, something akin to fear, chilled him (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) to the heart as he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) remembered the horrible things that have been done by women since that day upon which Eve was created to be Adam's companion and help-meet in the garden of Eden. ``What if this woman's hellish power of dissimulation should be stronger than the truth, and crush him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>)? She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had not spared George Talboys when he (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) stood in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) way and menaced her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) with a certain peril; would she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) spare him (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) who threatened her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) with a far greater danger? Are women merciful, or loving, or kind in proportion to their beauty and grace? Was there not a certain Monsieur Mazers de Latude, who had the bad fortune to offend the all-accomplished Madam de Pompadour, who expiated his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) youthful indiscretion by a life-long imprisonment; who twice escaped from prison, to be twice cast back into captivity; who, trusting in the tardy generosity of his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) beautiful foe, betrayed himself to an implacable fiend? Robert Audley looked at the pale face of the woman standing by his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) side; that fair and beautiful face, illumined by starry-blue eyes, that had a strange and surely a dangerous light in them; and remembering a hundred stories of womanly perfidy, shuddered as he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) thought how unequal the struggle might be between himself and his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) uncle's wife.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have shown her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) my cards,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) thought, <div class="bookquote">``but she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) has kept hers hidden from me. The mask that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) wears is not to be plucked away. My uncle would rather think me mad than believe her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) guilty.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The pale face of Clara Talboys--that grave and earnest face, so different in its character to my lady's fragile beauty--arose before him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What a coward I am to think of myself or my own danger,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) thought. <div class="bookquote">``The more I see of this woman the more reason I have to dread her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) influence upon others; the more reason to wish her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) far away from this house.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) looked about him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) in the dusky obscurity. The lonely garden was as quiet as some solitary grave-yard, walled in and hidden away from the world of the living.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It was somewhere in this garden that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) met George Talboys upon the day of his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) disappearance,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) thought. <div class="bookquote">``I wonder where it was they met; I wonder where it was that he (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) looked into her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) cruel face and taxed her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) falsehood?''

 (<font color='red'><b>lady</b></font>)</div><p/>My lady, with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) little hand resting lightly upon the opposite post to that against which Robert leaned, toyed with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) pretty foot among the long weeds, but kept a furtive watch upon her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) enemy's face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is to be a duel to the death, then, my lady,''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>said Robert Audley, solemnly. <div class="bookquote">``You refuse to accept my warning. You refuse to run away and repent of your wickedness in some foreign place, far from the generous gentleman you have deceived and fooled by your false witcheries. You choose to remain here and defy me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Audley/LADY AUDLEY</b></font>)</div>answered Lady Audley, lifting her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) head and looking full at the young barrister. <div class="bookquote">``It is no fault of mine if my husband's nephew goes mad, and chooses me for the victim of his (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>) monomania.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So be it, then, my lady,''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>answered Robert. <div class="bookquote">``My friend George Talboys was last seen entering these gardens by the little iron gate by which we came in to-night. He (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) was last heard inquiring for you. He (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) was seen to enter these gardens, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) was never seen to leave them. I believe that he (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) met his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) death within the boundary of these grounds; and that his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) body lies hidden below some quiet water, or in some forgotten corner of this place. I will have such a search made as shall level that house to the earth and root up every tree in these gardens, rather than I will fail in finding the grave of my murdered friend.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lucy Audley</b></font>)</div><p/>Lucy Audley uttered a long, low, wailing cry, and threw up her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) arms above her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) head with a wild gesture of despair, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) made no answer to the ghastly charge of her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) accuser. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) arms slowly dropped, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) stood staring at Robert Audley, her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) white face gleaming through the dusk, her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) blue eyes glittering and dilated.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You shall never live to do this,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I will kill you first. Why have you tormented me so? Why could you not let me alone? What harm had I ever done you that you should make yourself my persecutor, and dog my steps, and watch my looks, and play the spy upon me? Do you want to drive me mad? Do you know what it is to wrestle with a mad-woman? No,''  (<font color='red'><b>lady</b></font>)</div>cried my lady, with a laugh, <div class="bookquote">``you do not, or you would never--''

 (<font color='red'><b>lady</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) stopped abruptly and drew herself suddenly to her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) fullest hight. It was the same action which Robert had seen in the old half-drunken lieutenant; and it had that same dignity--the sublimity of extreme misery.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Go away, Mr. Audley,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``You are mad, I tell you, you are mad.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am going, my lady,''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>answered Robert, quietly. <div class="bookquote">``I would have condoned your crimes out of pity to your wretcheness. You have refused to accept my mercy. I wished to have pity upon the living. I shall henceforth only remember my duty to the dead.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) walked away from the lonely well under the shadow of the limes. My lady followed him (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) slowly down that long, gloomy avenue, and across the rustic bridge to the iron gate. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) passed through the gate, Alicia came out of a little half-glass door that opened from an oak-paneled breakfast-room at one angle of the house, and met her (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) cousin upon the threshold of the gateway.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have been looking for you everywhere, Robert,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Papa has come down to the library, and will be glad to see you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div><p/>The young man started at the sound of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cousin's fresh young voice. <div class="bookquote">``Good Heaven!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thought, <div class="bookquote">``can these two women be of the same clay? Can this frank, generous-hearted girl, who cannot conceal any impulse of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) innocent nature, be of the same flesh and blood as that wretched creature whose shadow falls upon the path beside me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) looked from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cousin to Lady Audley, who stood near the gateway, waiting for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to stand aside and let her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) pass him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know what has come to your cousin, my dear Alicia,''  (<font color='red'><b>lady</b></font>)</div>said my lady. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) is so absent-minded and eccentric as to be quite beyond my comprehension.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alicia/Miss Audley/Miss Alicia</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Miss Audley; <div class="bookquote">``and yet I should imagine, from the length of your tête-a-tête, that you had made some effort to understand him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Alicia/Miss Audley/Miss Alicia</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>said Robert, quietly, <div class="bookquote">``my lady and I understand each other very well; but as it is growing late I will wish you good-evening, ladies.

 (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What, Robert,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alicia/Miss Audley/Miss Alicia</b></font>)</div>cried Alicia, <div class="bookquote">``you surely won't go away without seeing papa?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Alicia/Miss Audley/Miss Alicia</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>answered the young man. <div class="bookquote">``I am a little disturbed by some disagreeable business in which I am very much concerned, and I would rather not see my uncle. Good-night, Alicia. I will come or write to-morrow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) pressed his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) cousin's hand, bowed to Lady Audley, and walked away under the black shadows of the archway, and out into the quiet avenue beyond the Court.

<p/>My lady and Alicia stood watching him (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) until he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) was out of sight.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What in goodness' name is the matter with my Cousin Robert?''  (<font color='red'><b>Alicia/Miss Audley/Miss Alicia</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Miss Audley, impatiently, as the barrister disappeared. <div class="bookquote">``What does he (<font color='blue'><b>Cousin</b></font>) mean by these absurd goings-on? Some disagreeable business that disturbs him (<font color='blue'><b>Cousin</b></font>), indeed! I suppose the unhappy creature has had a brief forced upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Cousin</b></font>) by some evil-starred attorney, and is sinking into a state of imbecility from a dim consciousness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Cousin</b></font>) own incompetence.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you ever studied your cousin's character, Alicia?''  (<font color='red'><b>lady</b></font>)</div>asked my lady, very seriously, after a pause.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Studied his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) character! No, Lady Audley. Why should I study his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) character?''  (<font color='red'><b>Alicia/Miss Audley/Miss Alicia</b></font>)</div>said Alicia. <div class="bookquote">``There is very little study required to convince anybody that he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) is a lazy, selfish Sybarite, who cares for nothing in the world except his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) own ease and comfort.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But have you never thought him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) eccentric?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Eccentric!''  (<font color='red'><b>Alicia/Miss Audley/Miss Alicia</b></font>)</div>repeated Alicia, pursing up her (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) red lips and shrugging up her (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) shoulders. <div class="bookquote">``Well, yes--I believe that is the excuse generally made for such people.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have never heard you speak of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) father and mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>lady</b></font>)</div>said my lady, thoughtfully. <div class="bookquote">``Do you remember them?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I never saw his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) mother.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Did you ever hear that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was eccentric--what people call `odd?'''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, no,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alicia/Miss Audley/Miss Alicia</b></font>)</div>said Alicia, laughing. <div class="bookquote">``My aunt was a very reasonable woman, I believe, though she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) did marry for love.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you recollect your uncle, I suppose.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My Uncle Robert?''  (<font color='red'><b>Alicia/Miss Audley/Miss Alicia</b></font>)</div>said Alicia. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes, I remember him (<font color='blue'><b>Uncle</b></font>) very well, indeed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Was he (<font color='blue'><b>Uncle</b></font>) eccentric--I mean to say, peculiar in his (<font color='blue'><b>Uncle</b></font>) habits, like your cousin?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I believe Robert inherits all his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) absurdities from his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) father.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) was eccentric?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; I suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) was generally thought a little eccentric.''

 (<font color='red'><b>lady</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mad!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Alicia/Miss Audley/Miss Alicia</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, Alicia; he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) will believe anything that I tell him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>lady</b></font>)</div>answered my lady, with a quiet smile.

<p/>CHAPTER XXX.

<p/>PREPARING THE GROUND.

<p/>Lady Audley went from the garden to the library, a pleasant, oak-paneled, homely apartment in which Sir Michael liked to sit reading or writing, or arranging the business of his (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) estate with his (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) steward, a stalwart countryman, half agriculturalist, half lawyer, who rented a small farm a few miles from the Court.

<p/>The baronet was seated in a capacious easy-chair near the hearth. The bright blaze of the fire rose and fell, flashing now upon the polished carvings of the black-oak bookcase, now upon the gold and scarlet bindings of the books; sometimes glimmering upon the Athenian helmet of a marble Pallas, sometimes lighting up the forehead of Sir Robert Peel.

<p/>The lamp upon the reading-table had not yet been lighted, and Sir Michael sat in the firelight waiting for the coming of his (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) young wife.

<p/>It is impossible for me ever to tell the purity of his (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) generous love--it is impossible to describe that affection which was as tender as the love of a young mother for her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) first born, as brave and chivalrous as the heroic passion of a Bayard for his (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) liege mistress.

<p/>The door opened while he (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) was thinking of this fondly-loved wife, and looking up, the baronet saw the slender form standing in the doorway.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, my darling!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) exclaimed, as my lady closed the door behind her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), and came toward his (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) chair, <div class="bookquote">``I have been thinking of you and waiting for you for an hour. Where have you been, and what have you been doing?''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>My lady, standing in the shadow rather than the light, paused a few moments before replying to this question.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have been to Chelmsford,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``shopping; and--''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) hesitated--twisting her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) bonnet strings in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) thin white fingers with an air of pretty embarrassment.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And what, my dear?''  (<font color='red'><b>the baronet</b></font>)</div>asked the baronet--<div class="bookquote">``what have you been doing since you came from Chelmsford? I heard a carriage stop at the door an hour ago. It was yours, was it not?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the baronet</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I came home an hour ago,''  (<font color='red'><b>lady</b></font>)</div>answered my lady, with the same air of embarrassment.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And what have you been doing since you came home?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Michael/Michael Audley/Audley</b></font>)</div><p/>Sir Michael Audley asked this question with a slightly reproachful accent. His (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) young wife's presence made the sunshine of his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) life; and though he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) could not bear to chain her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) side, it grieved him (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) to think that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) could willingly remain unnecessarily absent from him (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>), frittering away her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) time in some childish talk or frivolous occupation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What have you been doing since you came home, my dear?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) repeated. <div class="bookquote">``What has kept you so long away from me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have been--talking--to--Mr. Robert Audley.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) still twisted her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) bonnet-string round and round her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) fingers.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) still spoke with the same air of embarrassment.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Robert!''  (<font color='red'><b>the baronet</b></font>)</div>exclaimed the baronet; <div class="bookquote">``is Robert here?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the baronet</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) was here a little while ago.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And is here still, I suppose?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) has gone away.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Gone away!''  (<font color='red'><b>Michael/Michael Audley/Audley</b></font>)</div>cried Sir Michael. <div class="bookquote">``What do you mean, my darling?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I mean that your nephew came to the Court this afternoon. Alicia and I found him (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) idling about the gardens. He (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) stayed here till about a quarter of an hour ago talking to me, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) hurried off without a word of explanation; except, indeed, some ridiculous excuse about business at Mount Stanning.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Business at Mount Stanning! Why, what business can he (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) possibly have in that out-of-the-way place? He (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) has gone to sleep at Mount Stanning, then, I suppose?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; I think he (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) said something to that effect.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Upon my word,''  (<font color='red'><b>the baronet</b></font>)</div>exclaimed the baronet, <div class="bookquote">``I think that boy is half mad.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the baronet</b></font>)</div><p/>My lady's face was so much in shadow, that Sir Michael Audley was unaware of the bright change that came over its sickly pallor as he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) made this very commonplace observation. A triumphant smile illuminated Lucy Audley's countenance, a smile that plainly said, <div class="bookquote">``It is coming--it is coming; I can twist him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) which way I like. I can put black before him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), and if I say it is white, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) will believe me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lucy Audley</b></font>)</div><p/>But Sir Michael Audley in declaring that his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) nephew's wits were disordered, merely uttered that commonplace ejaculation which is well-known to have very little meaning. The baronet had, it is true, no very great estimate of Robert's faculty for the business of this everyday life. He (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) was in the habit of looking upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) nephew as a good-natured nonentity--a man whose heart had been amply stocked by liberal Nature with all the best things the generous goddess had to bestow, but whose brain had been somewhat overlooked in the distribution of intellectual gifts. Sir Michael Audley made that mistake which is very commonly made by easy-going, well-to-do-observers, who have no occasion to look below the surface. He (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) mistook laziness for incapacity. He (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) thought because his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) nephew was idle, he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) must necessarily be stupid. He (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) concluded that if Robert did not distinguish himself, it was because he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) could not.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) forgot the mute inglorious Miltons, who die voiceless and inarticulate for want of that dogged perseverance, that blind courage, which the poet must possess before he (<font color='blue'><b>poet</b></font>) can find a publisher; he (<font color='blue'><b>poet</b></font>) forgot the Cromwells, who see the noble vessels of the state floundering upon a sea of confusion, and going down in a tempest of noisy bewilderment, and who yet are powerless to get at the helm; forbidden even to send out a life-boat to the sinking ship. Surely it is a mistake to judge of what a man can do by that which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has done.

<p/>The world's Valhalla is a close borough, and perhaps the greatest men may be those who perish silently far away from the sacred portal. Perhaps the purest and brightest spirits are those who shrink from the turmoil of the race-course--the tumult and confusion of the struggle. The game of life is something like the game of écarte, and it may be that the very best cards are sometimes left in the pack.

<p/>My lady threw off her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) bonnet, and seated herself upon a velvet-covered footstool at Sir Michael's feet. There was nothing studied or affected in this girlish action. It was so natural to Lucy Audley to be childish, that no one would have wished to see her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) otherwise. It would have seemed as foolish to expect dignified reserve or womanly gravity from this amber-haired siren, as to wish for rich basses amid the clear treble of a sky-lark's song.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) sat with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) pale face turned away from the firelight, and with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) hands locked together upon the arm of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) husband's easy-chair. They were very restless, these slender white hands. My lady twisted the jeweled fingers in and out of each other as she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) talked to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) husband.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wanted to come to you, you know, dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)--<div class="bookquote">``I wanted to come to you directly I got home, but Mr. Audley insisted upon my stopping to talk to him (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But what about, my love?''  (<font color='red'><b>the baronet</b></font>)</div>asked the baronet. <div class="bookquote">``What could Robert have to say to you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>lady</b></font>)</div><p/>My lady did not answer this question. Her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) fair head dropped upon her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) husband's knee, her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) rippling, yellow curls fell over her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) face.

<p/>Sir Michael lifted that beautiful head with his (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) strong hands, and raised my lady's face. The firelight shining on that pale face lit up the large, soft blue eyes and showed them drowned in tears.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Lucy, Lucy!''  (<font color='red'><b>the baronet meaning</b></font>)</div>cried the baronet, <div class="bookquote">``what is the meaning of this? My love, my love! what has happened to distress you in this manner?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the baronet meaning</b></font>)</div><p/>Lady Audley tried to speak, but the words died inarticulately upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) trembling lips. A choking sensation in her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) throat seemed to strangle those false and plausible words, her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) only armor against her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) enemies. She (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) could not speak. The agony she (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) had endured silently in the dismal lime-walk had grown too strong for her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) broke into a tempest of hysterical sobbing. It was no simulated grief that shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) slender frame and tore at her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) like some ravenous beast that would have rent her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) piecemeal with its horrible strength. It was a storm of real anguish and terror, of remorse and misery. It was the one wild outcry, in which the woman's feebler nature got the better of the siren's art.

<p/>It was not thus that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had meant to fight her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) terrible duel with Robert Audley. Those were not the weapons which she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had intended to use; but perhaps no artifice which she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) could have devised would have served her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) so well as this one outburst of natural grief. It shook her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) husband to the very soul. It bewildered and terrified him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>). It reduced the strong intellect of the man to helpless confusion and perplexity. It struck at the one weak point in a good man's nature. It appealed straight to Sir Michael Audley's affection for his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) wife.

<p/>Ah, Heaven help a strong man's tender weakness for the woman he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) loves! Heaven pity him (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) when the guilty creature has deceived him (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) and comes with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) tears and lamentations to throw herself at his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) feet in self-abandonment and remorse; torturing him (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) with the sight of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) agony; rending his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) heart with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) sobs, lacerating his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) breast with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) groans--multiplying her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) sufferings into a great anguish for him (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) to bear! multiplying them by twenty-fold; multiplying them in a ratio of a brave man's capacity for endurance. Heaven forgive him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), if maddened by that cruel agony, the balance wavers for a moment, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is ready to forgive anything; ready to take this wretched one to the shelter of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) breast, and to pardon that which the stern voice of manly honor urges must not be pardoned. Pity him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), pity him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)! The wife's worst remorse when she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) stands without the threshold of the home she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) may never enter more is not equal to the agony of the husband who closes the portal on that familiar and entreating face. The anguish of the mother who may never look again upon her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) children is less than the torment of the father who has to say to those little ones, <div class="bookquote">``My darlings, you are henceforth motherless.''

 (<font color='red'><b>those ones</b></font>)</div><p/>Sir Michael Audley rose from his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) chair, trembling with indignation, and ready to do immediate battle with the person who had caused his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) wife's grief.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Lucy,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Lucy, I insist upon your telling me what and who has distressed you. I insist upon it. Whoever has annoyed you shall answer to me for your grief. Come, my love, tell me directly what it is.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) seated himself and bent over the drooping figure at his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) feet, calming his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) own agitation in his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) desire to soothe his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) wife's distress.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell me what it is, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) whispered, tenderly.

<p/>The sharp paroxysm had passed away, and my lady looked up. A glittering light shone through the tears in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) eyes, and the lines about her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) pretty rosy mouth, those hard and cruel lines which Robert Audley had observed in the pre-Raphaelite portrait, were plainly visible in the firelight.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am very silly,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``but really he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) has made me quite hysterical.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who--who has made you hysterical?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Your nephew--Mr. Robert Audley.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Robert,''  (<font color='red'><b>the baronet</b></font>)</div>cried the baronet. <div class="bookquote">``Lucy, what do you mean?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I told you that Mr. Audley insisted upon my going into the lime-walk, dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>lady</b></font>)</div>said my lady. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) wanted to talk to me, he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) said, and I went, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) said such horrible things that--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Audley/LADY AUDLEY</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What horrible things, Lucy?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Audley/LADY AUDLEY</b></font>)</div><p/>Lady Audley shuddered, and clung with convulsive fingers to the strong hand that had rested caressingly upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) shoulder.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, my dear love, how can I tell you?''  (<font color='red'><b>lady</b></font>)</div>cried my lady. <div class="bookquote">``I know that I shall distress you--or you will laugh at me, and then--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Laugh at you? no, Lucy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Audley/LADY AUDLEY</b></font>)</div><p/>Lady Audley was silent for a moment. She (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) sat looking straight before her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) into the fire, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) fingers still locked about her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) husband's hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) said, slowly, hesitating now and then between her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) words, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) almost shrunk from uttering them, <div class="bookquote">``have you ever--I am so afraid of vexing you--have you ever thought Mr. Audley a little--a little--''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A little what, my darling?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) mind!''  (<font color='red'><b>Michael/Michael Audley/Audley</b></font>)</div>cried Sir Michael. <div class="bookquote">``My dear girl, what are you thinking of?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You said just now, dear, that you thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) was half mad.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did I, my love?''  (<font color='red'><b>the baronet</b></font>)</div>said the baronet, laughing. <div class="bookquote">``I don't remember saying it, and it was a mere façon de parler, that meant nothing whatever. Robert may be a little eccentric--a little stupid, perhaps--he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) mayn't be overburdened with wits, but I don't think he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) has brains enough for madness. I believe it's generally your great intellects that get out of order.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But madness is sometimes hereditary,''  (<font color='red'><b>lady</b></font>)</div>said my lady. <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Audley may have inherited--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not to my knowledge.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``People generally keep these things a secret,''  (<font color='red'><b>lady</b></font>)</div>said my lady, gravely. <div class="bookquote">``There may have been madness in your sister-in-law's family.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think so, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Michael/Michael Audley/Audley</b></font>)</div>replied Sir Michael. <div class="bookquote">``But, Lucy, tell me what, in Heaven's name, has put this idea into your head.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have been trying to account for your nephew's conduct. I can account for it in no other manner. If you had heard the things he (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) said to me to-night, Sir Michael, you too might have thought him (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) mad.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But what did he (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) say, Lucy?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can scarcely tell you. You can see how much he (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) has stupefied and bewildered me. I believe he (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) has lived too long alone in those solitary Temple chambers. Perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) reads too much, or smokes too much. You know that some physicians declare madness to be a mere illness of the brain--an illness to which any one is subject, and which may be produced by given causes, and cured by given means.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Audley/LADY AUDLEY</b></font>)</div><p/>Lady Audley's eyes were still fixed upon the burning coals in the wide grate. She (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) spoke as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) had been discussing a subject that she (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) had often heard discussed before. She (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) spoke as if her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) mind had almost wandered away from the thought of her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) husband's nephew to the wider question of madness in the abstract.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why should he (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) not be mad?''  (<font color='red'><b>lady</b></font>)</div>resumed my lady. <div class="bookquote">``People are insane for years and years before their insanity is found out. They know that they are mad, but they know how to keep their secret; and, perhaps, they may sometimes keep it till they die. Sometimes a paroxysm seizes them, and in an evil hour they betray themselves. They commit a crime, perhaps. The horrible temptation of opportunity assails them; the knife is in their hand, and the unconscious victim by their side. They may conquer the restless demon and go away and die innocent of any violent deed; but they may yield to the horrible temptation--the frightful, passionate, hungry craving for violence and horror. They sometimes yield and are lost.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Audley/LADY AUDLEY</b></font>)</div><p/>Lady Audley's voice rose as she (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) argued this dreadful question, The hysterical excitement from which she (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) had only just recovered had left its effects upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>), but she (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) controlled herself, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) tone grew calmer as she (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) resumed:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Robert Audley is mad,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) said, decisively. <div class="bookquote">``What is one of the strangest diagnostics of madness--what is the first appalling sign of mental aberration? The mind becomes stationary; the brain stagnates; the even current of reflection is interrupted; the thinking power of the brain resolves itself into a monotone. As the waters of a tideless pool putrefy by reason of their stagnation, the mind becomes turbid and corrupt through lack of action; and the perpetual reflection upon one subject resolves itself into monomania. Robert Audley is a monomaniac. The disappearance of his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) friend, George Talboys, grieved and bewildered him (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) dwelt upon this one idea until he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) lost the power of thinking of anything else. The one idea looked at perpetually became distorted to his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) mental vision. Repeat the commonest word in the English language twenty times, and before the twentieth repetition you will have begun to wonder whether the word which you repeat is really the word you mean to utter. Robert Audley has thought of his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) friend's disappearance until the one idea has done its fatal and unhealthy work. He (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) looks at a common event with a vision that is diseased, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) distorts it into a gloomy horror engendered of his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) own monomania. If you do not want to make me as mad as he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) is, you must never let me see him (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) again. He (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) declared to-night that George Talboys was murdered in this place, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) will root up every tree in the garden, and pull down every brick in the house in search for--''

 (<font color='red'><b>lady</b></font>)</div><p/>My lady paused. The words died away upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) lips. She (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) had exhausted herself by the strange energy with which she (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) had spoken. She (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) had been transformed from a frivolous, childish beauty into a woman, strong to argue her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) own cause and plead her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) own defense.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Pull down this house?''  (<font color='red'><b>the baronet</b></font>)</div>cried the baronet. <div class="bookquote">``George Talboys murdered at Audley Court! Did Robert say this, Lucy?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) said something of that kind--something that frightened me very much.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) must be mad,''  (<font color='red'><b>Michael/Michael Audley/Audley</b></font>)</div>said Sir Michael, gravely. <div class="bookquote">``I'm bewildered by what you tell me.

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Audley/LADY AUDLEY</b></font>)</div><p/>Lady Audley had availed herself of the very strongest arguments by which she (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) could help her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) cause.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``To be sure, my darling, to be sure,''  (<font color='red'><b>the baronet</b></font>)</div>answered the baronet. <div class="bookquote">``What could have put such a horrible fancy into the unhappy boy's head. This Mr. Talboys--a perfect stranger to all of us--murdered at Audley Court! I'll go to Mount Stanning to-night, and see Robert.

 (<font color='red'><b>lady</b></font>)</div><p/>My lady shrugged her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) shoulders.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That is rather an open question,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``It is generally a stranger who is the first to observe any psychological peculiarity.''

 (<font color='red'><b>lady</b></font>)</div><p/>The big words sounded strange from my lady's rosy lips; but her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) newly-adopted wisdom had a certain quaint prettiness about it, which charmed and bewildered her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) husband.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But you must not go to Mount Stanning, my dear darling,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said, tenderly. <div class="bookquote">``Remember that you are under strict orders to stay in doors until the weather is milder, and the sun shines upon this cruel ice-bound country.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Michael/Michael Audley/Audley</b></font>)</div><p/>Sir Michael Audley sank back in his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) capacious chair with a sigh of resignation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's true, Lucy,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``we must obey Mr. Dawson. I suppose Robert will come to see me to-morrow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, dear. I think he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) would.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then we must wait till to-morrow, my darling. I can't believe that there really is anything wrong with the poor boy--I can't believe it, Lucy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then how do you account for this extraordinary delusion about this Mr. Talboys?''  (<font color='red'><b>lady</b></font>)</div>asked my lady.

<p/>Sir Michael shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) head.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know, Lucy--I don't know,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) answered. <div class="bookquote">``It is always so difficult to believe that any one of the calamities that continually befall our fellow-men will ever happen to us.

I tell you, my love, if there is anything wrong I am sure to find it out. I can't be mistaken in a young man who has always been the same to me as my own son. But, my darling, why were you so frightened by Robert's wild talk? It could not affect you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>lady</b></font>)</div><p/>My lady sighed piteously.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You must think me very strong-minded, Sir Michael,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said, with rather an injured air, <div class="bookquote">``if you imagine I can hear of these sort of things indifferently.

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you shall not, my dear--you shall not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You said just now you would have him (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) here,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Audley/LADY AUDLEY</b></font>)</div>murmured Lady Audley.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But I will not, my darling girl, if his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) presence annoys you. Good Heaven!

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You must think me very unkind, dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>lady</b></font>)</div>said my lady, <div class="bookquote">``and I know I ought not to be annoyed by the poor fellow; but he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) really seems to have taken some absurd notion into his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) head about me.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, dear. He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) seems to connect me in some vague manner--which I cannot quite understand--with the disappearance of this Mr. Talboys.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Impossible, Lucy! You must have misunderstood him (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) must be mad,''  (<font color='red'><b>the baronet</b></font>)</div>said the baronet--<div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) must be mad. I will wait till he (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) goes back to town, and then send some one to his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) chambers to talk to him (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>).

 (<font color='red'><b>the baronet</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I fear I have distressed you, darling,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Audley/LADY AUDLEY</b></font>)</div>murmured Lady Audley.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, my dear, I am very much distressed by what you have told me; but you were quite right to talk to me frankly about this dreadful business. I must think it over, dearest, and try and decide what is best to be done.''

 (<font color='red'><b>lady</b></font>)</div><p/>My lady rose from the low ottoman on which she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had been seated. The fire had burned down, and there was only a faint glow of red light in the room. Lucy Audley bent over her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) husband's chair, and put her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) lips to his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) broad forehead.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How good you have always been to me, dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) whispered softly. <div class="bookquote">``You would never let any one influence you against me, would you, dear?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Influence me against you?''  (<font color='red'><b>the baronet</b></font>)</div>repeated the baronet. <div class="bookquote">``No, my love.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because you know, dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>lady</b></font>)</div>pursued my lady, <div class="bookquote">``there are wicked people as well as mad people in the world, and there may be some persons to whose interest it would be to injure me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>lady</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They had better not try it, then, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Michael/Michael Audley/Audley</b></font>)</div>answered Sir Michael; <div class="bookquote">``they would find themselves in rather a dangerous position if they did.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Michael/Michael Audley/Audley</b></font>)</div><p/>Lady Audley laughed aloud, with a gay, triumphant, silvery peal of laughter that vibrated through the quiet room.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My own dear darling,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I know you love me.

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, dear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>lady</b></font>)</div><p/>My lady tripped out of the room to give her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) orders about the message that was to be carried to the house at which she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was to have dined. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) paused for a moment as she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) closed the library door--she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) paused, and laid her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) hand upon her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) breast to check the rapid throbbing of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) heart.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have been afraid of you, Mr. Robert Audley,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) thought; <div class="bookquote">``but perhaps the time may come in which you will have cause to be afraid of me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER XXXI.

<p/>PHOEBE``S PETITION.

<p/>The division between Lady Audley and her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) step-daughter had not become any narrower in the two months which had elapsed since the pleasant Christmas holiday time had been kept at Audley Court. There was no open warfare between the two women; there was only an armed neutrality, broken every now and then by brief feminine skirmishes and transient wordy tempests. I am sorry to say that Alicia would very much have preferred a hearty pitched battle to this silent and undemonstrative disunion; but it was not very easy to quarrel with my lady. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had soft answers for the turning away of wrath. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) could smile bewitchingly at her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) step-daughter's open petulance, and laugh merrily at the young lady's ill-temper. Perhaps had she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) been less amiable, had she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) been more like Alicia in disposition, the two ladies might have expended their enmity in one tremendous quarrel, and might ever afterward have been affectionate and friendly. But Lucy Audley would not make war. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) carried forward the sum of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) dislike, and put it out at a steady rate of interest, until the breach between her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) step-daughter and herself, widening a little every day, became a great gulf, utterly impassable by olive-branch-bearing doves from either side of the abyss. There can be no reconciliation where there is no open warfare. There must be a battle, a brave, boisterous battle, with pennants waving and cannon roaring, before there can be peaceful treaties and enthusiastic shaking of hands. Perhaps the union between France and England owes its greatest force to the recollection of Cressy and Waterloo, Navarino and Trafalgar. We have hated each other and licked each other and had it out, as the common phrase goes; and we can afford now to fall into each others' arms and vow eternal friendship and everlasting brotherhood. Let us hope that when Northern Yankeedom has decimated and been decimated, blustering Jonathan may fling himself upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Jonathan</b></font>) Southern brother's breast, forgiving and forgiven.

<p/>Alicia Audley and her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) father's pretty wife had plenty of room for the comfortable indulgence of their dislike in the spacious old mansion. My lady had her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) own apartments, as we know--luxurious chambers, in which all conceivable elegancies had been gathered for the comfort of their occupant. Alicia had her (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) own rooms in another part of the large house. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) had her (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) favorite mare, her (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) Newfoundland dog, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) drawing materials, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) made herself tolerably happy. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) was not very happy, this frank, generous-hearted girl, for it was scarcely possible that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) could be altogether at ease in the constrained atmosphere of the Court. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) father was changed; that dear father over whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) had once reigned supreme with the boundless authority of a spoiled child, had accepted another ruler and submitted to a new dynasty. Little by little my lady's petty power made itself felt in that narrow household; and Alicia saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) father gradually lured across the gulf that divided Lady Audley from her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) step-daughter, until he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) stood at last quite upon the other side of the abyss, and looked coldly upon his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) only child across that widening chasm.


<p/>Alicia felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was lost to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>). My lady's beaming smiles, my lady's winning words, my lady's radiant glances and bewitching graces had done their work of enchantment, and Sir Michael had grown to look upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) daughter as a somewhat wilful and capricious young person who had behaved with determined unkindness to the wife he (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) loved.

<p/>Poor Alicia saw all this, and bore her (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) burden as well as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) could. It seemed very hard to be a handsome, gray-eyed heiress, with dogs and horses and servants at her (<font color='blue'><b>heiress</b></font>) command, and yet to be so much alone in the world as to know of not one friendly ear into which she (<font color='blue'><b>heiress</b></font>) might pour her (<font color='blue'><b>heiress</b></font>) sorrows.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If Bob was good for anything I could have told him (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) how unhappy I am,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alicia/Miss Audley/Miss Alicia</b></font>)</div>thought Miss Audley; <div class="bookquote">``but I may just as well tell Caesar my troubles for any consolation I should get from Cousin Robert.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Alicia/Miss Audley/Miss Alicia</b></font>)</div><p/>Sir Michael Audley obeyed his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) pretty nurse, and went to bed a little after nine o'clock upon this bleak March evening. Perhaps the baronet's bedroom was about the pleasantést retreat that an invalid could have chosen in such cold and cheerless weather. The dark-green velvet curtains were drawn before the windows and about the ponderous bed. The wood fire burned redly upon the broad hearth. The reading lamp was lighted upon a delicious little table close to Sir Michael's pillow, and a heap of magazines and newspapers had been arranged by my lady's own fair hands for the pleasure of the invalid.

<p/>Lady Audley sat by the bedside for about ten minutes, talking to her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) husband, talking very seriously, about this strange and awful question--Robert Audley's lunacy; but at the end of that time she (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) rose and bade her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) husband good-night.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) lowered the green silk shade before the reading lamp, adjusting it carefully for the repose of the baronet's eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall leave you, dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``If you can sleep, so much the better. If you wish to read, the books and papers are close to you. I will leave the doors between the rooms open, and I shall hear your voice if you call me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Audley/LADY AUDLEY</b></font>)</div><p/>Lady Audley went through her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) dressing-room into the boudoir, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) had sat with her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) husband since dinner.

<p/>Every evidence of womanly refinement was visible in the elegant chamber. My lady's piano was open, covered with scattered sheets of music and exquisitely-bound collections of scenas and fantasias which no master need have disdained to study. My lady's easel stood near the window, bearing witness to my lady's artistic talent, in the shape of a water-colored sketch of the Court and gardens. My lady's fairy-like embroideries of lace and muslin, rainbow-hued silks, and delicately-tinted wools littered the luxurious apartment; while the looking-glasses, cunningly placed at angles and opposite corners by an artistic upholsterer, multiplied my lady's image, and in that image reflected the most beautiful object in the enchanted chamber.

<p/>Amid all this lamplight, gilding, color, wealth, and beauty, Lucy Audley sat down on a low seat by the fire to think.

<p/>If Mr. Holman Hunt could have peeped into the pretty boudoir, I think the picture would have been photographed upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Hunt</b></font>) brain to be reproduced by-and-by upon a bishop's half-length for the glorification of the pre-Raphaelite brotherhood. My lady in that half-recumbent attitude, with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) elbow resting on one knee, and her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) perfect chin supported by her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) hand, the rich folds of drapery falling away in long undulating lines from the exquisite outline of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) figure, and the luminous, rose-colored firelight enveloping her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) in a soft haze, only broken by the golden glitter of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) yellow hair--beautiful in herself, but made bewilderingly beautiful by the gorgeous surroundings which adorn the shrine of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) loveliness. Drinking-cups of gold and ivory, chiseled by Benvenuto Cellini; cabinets of buhl and porcelain, bearing the cipher of Austrian Marie-Antoinette, amid devices of rosebuds and true-lovers' knots, birds and butterflies, cupidons and shepherdesses, goddesses, courtiers, cottagers, and milkmaids; statuettes of Parian marble and biscuit china; gilded baskets of hothouse flowers; fantastical caskets of Indian filigree-work; fragile tea-cups of turquoise china, adorned by medallion miniatures of Louis the Great and Louis the Well-beloved, Louise de la Valliere, Athenais de Montespan, and Marie Jeanne Gomard de Vaubernier: cabinet pictures and gilded mirrors, shimmering satin and diaphanous lace; all that gold can buy or art devise had been gathered together for the beautification of this quiet chamber in which my lady sat listening to the mourning of the shrill March wind, and the flapping of the ivy leaves against the casements, and looking into the red chasms in the burning coals.

<p/>I should be preaching a very stale sermon, and harping upon a very familiar moral, if I were to seize this opportunity of declaiming against art and beauty, because my lady was more wretched in this elegant apartment than many a half-starved seamstress in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) dreary garret. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was wretched by reason of a wound which lay too deep for the possibility of any solace from such plasters as wealth and luxury; but her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) wretchedness was of an abnormal nature, and I can see no occasion for seizing upon the fact of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) misery as an argument in favor of poverty and discomfort as opposed to opulence. The Benvenuto Cellini carvings and the Sevres porcelain could not give her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) happiness, because she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had passed out of their region. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was no longer innocent; and the pleasure we take in art and loveliness being an innocent pleasure, had passed beyond her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) reach. Six or seven years before, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) would have been happy in the possession of this little Aladdin's palace; but she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had wandered out of the circle of careless, pleasure seeking creatures, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had strayed far away into a desolate labyrinth of guilt and treachery, terror and crime, and all the treasures that had been collected for her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) could have given her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) no pleasure but one, the pleasure of flinging them into a heap beneath her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) feet and trampling upon them and destroying them in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) cruel despair.

<p/>There were some things that would have inspired her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) with an awful joy, a horrible rejoicing. If Robert Audley, her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) pitiless enemy, her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) unrelenting pursuer, had lain dead in the adjoining chamber, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) would have exulted over his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) bier.

<p/>What pleasures could have remained for Lucretia Borgia and Catharine de Medici, when the dreadful boundary line between innocence and guilt was passed, and the lost creatures stood upon the lonely outer side? Only horrible, vengeful joys, and treacherous delights were left for these miserable women. With what disdainful bitterness they must have watched the frivolous vanities, the petty deceptions, the paltry sins of ordinary offenders. Perhaps they took a horrible pride in the enormity of their wickedness; in this <div class="bookquote">``Divinity of Hell,''  (<font color='red'><b>creatures</b></font>)</div>which made them greatest among sinful creatures.

<p/>My lady, brooding by the fire in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) lonely chamber, with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) large, clear blue eyes fixed upon the yawning gulfs of lurid crimson in the burning coals, may have thought of many things very far away from the terribly silent struggle in which she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was engaged. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) may have thought of long-ago years of childish innocence, childish follies and selfishness, of frivolous, feminine sins that had weighed very lightly upon her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) conscience. Perhaps in that retrospective revery she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) recalled that early time in which she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had first looked in the glass and discovered that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was beautiful; that fatal early time in which she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had first begun to look upon her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) loveliness as a right divine, a boundless possession which was to be a set-off against all girlish shortcomings, a counterbalance of every youthful sin. Did she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) remember the day in which that fairy dower of beauty had first taught her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) to be selfish and cruel, indifferent to the joys and sorrows of others, cold-hearted and capricious, greedy of admiration, exacting and tyrannical with that petty woman's tyranny which is the worst of despotism? Did she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) trace every sin of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) life back to its true source? and did she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) discover that poisoned fountain in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) own exaggerated estimate of the value of a pretty face? Surely, if her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) thoughts wandered so far along the backward current of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) life, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) must have repented in bitterness and despair of that first day in which the master-passions of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) life had become her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) rulers, and the three demons of Vanity, Selfishness, and Ambition, had joined hands and said, <div class="bookquote">``This woman is our slave, let us see what she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) will become under our guidance.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Vanity Selfishness Ambition</b></font>)</div><p/>How small those first youthful errors seemed as my lady looked back upon them in that long revery by the lonely hearth! What small vanities, what petty cruelties! A triumph over a schoolfellow; a flirtation with the lover of a friend; an assertion of the right divine invested in blue eyes and shimmering golden-tinted hair. But how terribly that narrow pathway had widened out into the broad highroad of sin, and how swift the footsteps had become upon the now familiar way!

<p/>My lady twisted her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) fingers in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) loose amber curls, and made as if she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) would have torn them from her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) head. But even in that moment of mute despair the unyielding dominion of beauty asserted itself, and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) released the poor tangled glitter of ringlets, leaving them to make a halo round her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) head in the dim firelight.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I was not wicked when I was young,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) thought, as she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) stared gloomingly at the fire, <div class="bookquote">``I was only thoughtless. I never did any harm--at least, wilfully. Have I ever been really wicked, I wonder?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) mused. <div class="bookquote">``My worst wickednesses have been the result of wild impulses, and not of deeply-laid plots. I am not like the women I have read of, who have lain night after night in the horrible darkness and stillness, planning out treacherous deeds, and arranging every circumstance of an appointed crime. I wonder whether they suffered--those women--whether they ever suffered as--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) thoughts wandered away into a weary maze of confusion. Suddenly she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) drew herself up with a proud, defiant gesture, and her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) eyes glittered with a light that was not entirely reflected from the fire.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are mad, Mr. Robert Audley,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``you are mad, and your fancies are a madman's fancies. I know what madness is. I know its signs and tokens, and I say that you are mad.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) put her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) hand to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) head, as if thinking of something which confused and bewildered her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), and which she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) found it difficult to contemplate with calmness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dare I defy him (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) muttered. <div class="bookquote">``Dare I? dare I? Will he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) stop, now that he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) has once gone so far? Will he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) stop for fear of me? Will he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) stop for fear of me, when the thought of what his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) uncle must suffer has not stopped him (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>)? Will anything stop him (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>)--but death?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) pronounced the last words in an awful whisper; and with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) head bent forward, her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) eyes dilated, and her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) lips still parted as they had been parted in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) utterance of that final word <div class="bookquote">``death,''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) sat blankly staring at the fire.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't plot horrible things,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) muttered, presently; <div class="bookquote">``my brain isn't strong enough, or I'm not wicked enough, or brave enough. If I met Robert Audley in those lonely gardens, as I--''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>The current of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) thoughts was interrupted by a cautious knocking at her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) door. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) rose suddenly, startled by any sound in the stillness of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) room. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) rose, and threw herself into a low chair near the fire. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) flung her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) beautiful head back upon the soft cushions, and took a book from the table near her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>). Insignificant as this action was, it spoke very plainly. It spoke very plainly of ever-recurring fears--of fatal necessities for concealment--of a mind that in its silent agonies was ever alive to the importance of outward effect. It told more plainly than anything else could have told how complete an actress my lady had been made by the awful necessity of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) life.

<p/>The modest rap at the door was repeated.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come in,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Audley/LADY AUDLEY</b></font>)</div>cried Lady Audley, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) liveliest tone.

<p/>The door was opened with that respectful noiselessness peculiar to a well-bred servant, and a young woman, plainly dressed, and carrying some of the cold March winds in the folds of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) garments, crossed the threshold of the apartment and lingered near the door, waiting permission to approach the inner regions of my lady's retreat.

<p/>It was Phoebe Marks, the pale-faced wife of the Mount Stanning innkeeper.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I beg pardon, my lady, for intruding without leave,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Marks</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``but I thought I might venture to come straight up without waiting for permission.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, yes, Phoebe, to be sure. Take off your bonnet, you wretched, cold-looking creature, and come sit down here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Audley/LADY AUDLEY</b></font>)</div><p/>Lady Audley pointed to the low ottoman upon which she (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) had herself been seated a few minutes before. The lady's maid had often sat upon it listening to her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) mistress' prattle in the old days, when she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) had been my lady's chief companion and confidante.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sit down here, Phoebe,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Audley/LADY AUDLEY</b></font>)</div>Lady Audley repeated; <div class="bookquote">``sit down here and talk to me; I'm very glad you came here to-night. I was horribly lonely in this dreary place.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Audley/LADY AUDLEY</b></font>)</div><p/>My lady shivered and looked round at the bright collection of bric-a-brac, as if the Sevres and bronze, the buhl and ormolu, had been the moldering adornments of some ruined castle. The dreary wretchedness of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) thoughts had communicated itself to every object about her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), and all outer things took their color from that weary inner life which held its slow course of secret anguish in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) breast. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had spoken the entire truth in saying that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was glad of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) lady's maid's visit. Her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) frivolous nature clung to this weak shelter in the hour of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) fear and suffering. There were sympathies between her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) and this girl, who was like herself, inwardly as well as outwardly--like herself, selfish, and cold, and cruel, eager for her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) own advancement, and greedy of opulence and elegance; angry with the lot that had been cast her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), and weary of dull dependence. My lady hated Alicia for her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) frank, passionate, generous, daring nature; she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) hated her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) step-daughter, and clung to this pale-faced, pale-haired girl, whom she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) thought neither better nor worse than herself.

<p/>Phoebe Marks obeyed her (<font color='blue'><b>Marks</b></font>) late mistress' commands, and took off her (<font color='blue'><b>Marks</b></font>) bonnet before seating herself on the ottoman at Lady Audley's feet. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) smooth bands of light hair were unruffled by the March winds; her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) trimly-made drab dress and linen collar were as neatly arranged as they could have been had she (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) only that moment completed her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) toilet.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sir Michael is better, I hope, my lady,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Phoebe, much better. He (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) is asleep. You may close that door,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Audley/LADY AUDLEY</b></font>)</div>added Lady Audley, with a motion of her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) head toward the door of communication between the rooms, which had been left open.

<p/>Mrs. Marks obeyed submissively, and then returned to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marks</b></font>) seat.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am very, very unhappy, Phoebe,''  (<font color='red'><b>lady</b></font>)</div>my lady said, fretfully; <div class="bookquote">``wretchedly miserable.''

 (<font color='red'><b>lady</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``About the--secret?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Marks</b></font>)</div>asked Mrs. Marks, in a half whisper.

<p/>My lady did not notice that question. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) resumed in the same complaining tone. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was glad to be able to complain even to this lady's maid. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had brooded over her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) fears, and had suffered in secret so long, that it was an inexpressible relief to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) to bemoan her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) fate aloud.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am cruelly persecuted and harassed, Phoebe Marks,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I am pursued and tormented by a man whom I never injured, whom I have never wished to injure. I am never suffered to rest by this relentless tormentor, and--''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) paused, staring at the fire again, as she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had done in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) loneliness. Lost again in the dark intricacies of thoughts which wandered hither and thither in a dreadful chaos of terrified bewilderments, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) could not come to any fixed conclusion.

<p/>Phoebe Marks watched my lady's face, looking upward at her (<font color='blue'><b>Marks</b></font>) late mistress with pale, anxious eyes, that only relaxed their watchfulness when Lady Audley's glance met that of her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) companion.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think I know whom you mean, my lady,''  (<font color='red'><b>the innkeeper</b></font>)</div>said the innkeeper's wife, after a pause; <div class="bookquote">``I think I know who it is who is so cruel to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>innkeeper wife</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, of course,''  (<font color='red'><b>lady</b></font>)</div>answered my lady, bitterly; <div class="bookquote">``my secrets are everybody's secrets. You know all about it, no doubt.''

 (<font color='red'><b>lady</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The person is a gentleman--is he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) not, my lady?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A gentleman who came to the Castle Inn two months ago, when I warned you--''

 (<font color='red'><b>lady</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>lady</b></font>)</div>answered my lady, impatiently.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought so. The same gentleman is at our place to-night, my lady.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Audley/LADY AUDLEY</b></font>)</div><p/>Lady Audley started up from her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) chair--started up as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) would have done something desperate in her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) despairing fury; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) sank back again with a weary, querulous sigh. What warfare could such a feeble creature wage against her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) fate? What could she (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) do but wind like a hunted hare till she (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) found her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) way back to the starting-point of the cruel chase, to be there trampled down by her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) pursuers?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``At the Castle Inn?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) cried. <div class="bookquote">``I might have known as much. He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) has gone there to wring my secrets from your husband. Fool!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) exclaimed, suddenly turning upon Phoebe Marks in a transport of anger, <div class="bookquote">``do you want to destroy me that you have left those two men together?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Phoebe/Phoebe Marks/PHOEBE</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Marks clasped her (<font color='blue'><b>Marks</b></font>) hands piteously.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I didn't come away of my own free will, my lady,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Marks</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``no one could have been more unwilling to leave the house than I was this night. I was sent here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who sent you here?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Luke, my lady. You can't tell how hard he (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) can be upon me if I go against him (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why did he (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) send you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>The innkeeper</b></font>)</div><p/>The innkeeper's wife dropped her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) eyelids under Lady Audley's angry glances, and hesitated confusedly before she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) answered this question.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed, my lady,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) stammered, <div class="bookquote">``I didn't want to come. I told Luke that it was too bad for us to worry you, first asking this favor, and then asking that, and never leaving you alone for a month together; but--but--he (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) bore me down with his (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) loud, blustering talk, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) made me come.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Audley/LADY AUDLEY</b></font>)</div>cried Lady Audley, impatiently. <div class="bookquote">``I know that. I want to know why you have come.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, you know, my lady,''  (<font color='red'><b>Phoebe/Phoebe Marks/PHOEBE</b></font>)</div>answered Phoebe, half reluctantly, <div class="bookquote">``Luke is very extravagant; and all I can say to him (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>), I can't get him (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) to be careful or steady. He (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>)'s not sober; and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>)'s drinking with a lot of rough countrymen, and drinking, perhaps even more than they do, it isn't likely that his (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) head can be very clear for accounts. If it hadn't been for me we should have been ruined before this; and hard as I've tried, I haven't been able to keep the ruin off. You remember giving me the money for the brewer's bill, my lady?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Phoebe/Phoebe Marks/PHOEBE</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I remember very well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Audley/LADY AUDLEY</b></font>)</div>answered Lady Audley, with a bitter laugh, <div class="bookquote">``for I wanted that money to pay my own bills.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Audley/LADY AUDLEY</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know you did, my lady, and it was very, very hard for me to have to come and ask you for it, after all that we'd received from you before.

 (<font color='red'><b>Lucy Audley</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Unless I pay your rent, I suppose,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy Audley</b></font>)</div>cried Lucy Audley. <div class="bookquote">``I might have guessed what was coming.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed, indeed, my lady, I wouldn't have asked it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Phoebe/Phoebe Marks/PHOEBE</b></font>)</div>sobbed Phoebe Marks, <div class="bookquote">``but he (<font color='blue'><b>bailiff</b></font>) made me come.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Phoebe/Phoebe Marks/PHOEBE</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>lady</b></font>)</div>answered my lady, bitterly, <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>bailiff</b></font>) made you come; and he (<font color='blue'><b>bailiff</b></font>) will make you come whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>bailiff</b></font>) pleases, and whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>bailiff</b></font>) wants money for the gratification of his (<font color='blue'><b>bailiff</b></font>) low vices; and you and he (<font color='blue'><b>bailiff</b></font>) are my pensioners as long as I live, or as long as I have any money to give; for I suppose when my purse is empty and my credit ruined, you and your husband will turn upon me and sell me to the highest bidder. Do you know, Phoebe Marks, that my jewel-case has been half emptied to meet your claims? Do you know that my pin-money, which I thought such a princely allowance when my marriage settlement was made, and when I was a poor governess at Mr. Dawson's, Heaven help me! my pin-money has been overdrawn half a year to satisfy your demands? What can I do to appease you? Shall I sell my Marie Antoinette cabinet, or my pompadour china, Leroy's and Benson's ormolu clocks, or my Gobelin tapestried chairs and ottomans? How shall I satisfy you next?''

 (<font color='red'><b>lady</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, my lady, my lady,''  (<font color='red'><b>Phoebe/Phoebe Marks/PHOEBE</b></font>)</div>cried Phoebe, piteously, <div class="bookquote">``don't be so cruel to me; you know, you know that it isn't I who want to impose upon you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Phoebe/Phoebe Marks/PHOEBE</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know nothing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Audley/LADY AUDLEY</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Lady Audley, <div class="bookquote">``except that I am the most miserable of women.

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) put her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) hands to her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) forehead, clasping her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) slender fingers across her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) brow, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) would have controlled the action of her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) brain by their convulsive pressure.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Robert Audley is with your husband,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) said, slowly, speaking to herself rather than to her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) companion. <div class="bookquote">``These two men are together, and there are bailiffs in the house, and your brutal husband is no doubt brutally drunk by this time, and brutally obstinate and ferocious in his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) drunkenness. If I refuse to pay this money his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) ferocity will be multiplied by a hundredfold. There's little use in discussing that matter. The money must be paid.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But if you do pay it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Phoebe/Phoebe Marks/PHOEBE</b></font>)</div>said Phoebe, earnestly, <div class="bookquote">``I hope you will impress upon Luke that it is the last money you will ever give him (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) while he (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) stops in that house.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Phoebe/Phoebe Marks/PHOEBE</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Audley/LADY AUDLEY</b></font>)</div>asked Lady Audley, letting her (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) hands fall on her (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) lap, and looking inquiringly at Mrs. Marks.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Because I want Luke to leave the Castle.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But why do you want him (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) to leave?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, for ever so many reasons, my lady,''  (<font color='red'><b>Phoebe/Phoebe Marks/PHOEBE</b></font>)</div>answered Phoebe. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>)'s not fit to be the landlord of a public-house. I didn't know that when I married him (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>), or I would have gone against the business, and tried to persuade him (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) to take to the farming line. Not that I suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>)'d have given up his (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) own fancy, either; for he (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>)'s obstinate enough, as you know, my lady. He (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>)'s not fit for his (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) present business. He (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>)'s scarcely ever sober after dark; and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>)'s drunk he (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) gets almost wild, and doesn't seem to know what he (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) does. We've had two or three narrow escapes with him (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) already.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Narrow escapes!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Audley/LADY AUDLEY</b></font>)</div>repeated Lady Audley. <div class="bookquote">``What do you mean?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, we've run the risk of being burnt in our beds through his (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) carelessness.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Burnt in your beds through his (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) carelessness! Why, how was that?''  (<font color='red'><b>lady</b></font>)</div>asked my lady, rather listlessly. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was too selfish, and too deeply absorbed in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) own troubles to take much interest in any danger which had befallen her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) some-time lady's-maid.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You know what a queer old place the Castle is, my lady; all tumble-down wood-work, and rotten rafters, and such like. The Chelmsford Insurance Company won't insure it; for they say if the place did happen to catch fire of a windy night it would blaze away like so much tinder, and nothing in the world could save it. Well, Luke knows this; and the landlord has warned him (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) of it times and often, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) lives close against us, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) keeps a pretty sharp eye upon all my husband's goings on; but when Luke's tipsy he (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) doesn't know what he (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>)'s about, and only a week ago he (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) left a candle burning in one of the out-houses, and the flame caught one of the rafters of the sloping roof, and if it hadn't been for me finding it out when I went round the house the last thing, we should have all been burnt to death, perhaps. And that's the third time the same kind of thing has happened in the six months we've had the place, and you can't wonder that I'm frightened, can you, my lady?''

 (<font color='red'><b>lady</b></font>)</div><p/>My lady had not wondered, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had not thought about the business at all. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had scarcely listened to these commonplace details; why should she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) care for this low-born waiting-woman's perils and troubles? Had she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) not her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) own terrors, her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) own soul-absorbing perplexities to usurp every thought of which her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) brain was capable?

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) did not make any remark upon that which poor Phoebe just told her (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) scarcely comprehended what had been said, until some moments after the girl had finished speaking, when the words assumed their full meaning, as some words do after they have been heard without being heeded.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Burnt in your beds,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>said the young lady, at last. <div class="bookquote">``It would have been a good thing for me if that precious creature, your husband, had been burnt in his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) bed before to-night.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>A vivid picture had flashed upon her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) spoke. The picture of that frail wooden tenement, the Castle Inn, reduced to a roofless chaos of lath and plaster, vomiting flames from its black mouth, and spitting blazing sparks upward toward the cold night sky.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) gave a weary sigh as she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) dismissed this image from her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) restless brain. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) would be no better off even if this enemy should be for ever silenced. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had another and far more dangerous foe--a foe who was not to be bribed or bought off, though she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had been as rich as an empress.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll give you the money to send this bailiff away,''  (<font color='red'><b>lady</b></font>)</div>my lady said, after a pause. <div class="bookquote">``I must give you the last sovereign in my purse, but what of that? you know as well as I do that I dare not refuse you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Audley/LADY AUDLEY</b></font>)</div><p/>Lady Audley rose and took the lighted lamp from her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) writing-table. <div class="bookquote">``The money is in my dressing-room,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``I will go and fetch it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, my lady,''  (<font color='red'><b>Phoebe/Phoebe Marks/PHOEBE</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Phoebe, suddenly, <div class="bookquote">``I forgot something; I was in such a way about this business that I quite forgot it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Phoebe/Phoebe Marks/PHOEBE</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Quite forgot what?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A letter that was given me to bring to you, my lady, just before I left home.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What letter?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A letter from Mr. Audley. He (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) heard my husband mention that I was coming down here, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) asked me to carry this letter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Audley/LADY AUDLEY</b></font>)</div><p/>Lady Audley set the lamp down upon the table nearest to her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>), and held out her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) hand to receive the letter. Phoebe Marks could scarcely fail to observe that the little jeweled hand shook like a leaf.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Give it me--give it me,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Marks</b></font>) cried; <div class="bookquote">``let me see what more he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) has to say.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Lady Audley almost snatched the letter from Phoebe's hand in her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) wild impatience. She (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) tore open the envelope and flung it from her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) could scarcely unfold the sheet of note-paper in her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) eager excitement.

<p/>The letter was very brief. It contained only these words:

<p/>``Should Mrs. George Talboys really have survived the date of her (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) supposed death, as recorded in the public prints, and upon the tombstone in Ventnor churchyard, and should she (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) exist in the person of the lady suspected and accused by the writer of this, there can be no great difficulty in finding some one able and willing to identify her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>). Mrs. Barkamb, the owner of North Cottages, Wildernsea, would no doubt consent to throw some light upon this matter; either to dispel a delusion or to confirm a suspicion.

<p/>``ROBERT AUDLEY.

<p/>``March 3, 1859.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The Castle Inn, Mount Stanning.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER XXXII.

<p/>THE RED LIGHT IN THE SKY.

<p/>My lady crushed the letter fiercely in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) hand, and flung it from her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) into the flames.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If he (<font color='blue'><b>AUDLEY</b></font>) stood before me now, and I could kill him (<font color='blue'><b>AUDLEY</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) muttered in a strange, inward whisper, <div class="bookquote">``I would do it--I would do it!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) snatched up the lamp and rushed into the adjoining room. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) shut the door behind her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) could not endure any witness of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) horrible despair--she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) could endure nothing, neither herself nor her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) surroundings.

<p/>The door between my lady's dressing-room and the bed-chamber in which Sir Michael lay, had been left open. The baronet slept peacefully, his (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) noble face plainly visible in the subdued lamplight. His (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) breathing was low and regular, his (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) lips curved into a half smile--a smile of tender happiness which he (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) often wore when he (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) beautiful wife, the smile of an all-indulgent father, who looks admiringly at his (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) favorite child.

<p/>Some touch of womanly feeling, some sentiment of compassion softened Lady Audley's glance as it fell upon that noble, reposing figure. For a moment the horrible egotism of her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) own misery yielded to her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) pitying tenderness for another. It was perhaps only a semi-selfish tenderness after all, in which pity for herself was as powerful as pity for her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) husband; but for once in a way, her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) thoughts ran out of the narrow groove of her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) own terrors and her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) own troubles to dwell with prophetic grief upon the coming sorrows of another.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If they make him (<font color='blue'><b>AUDLEY</b></font>) believe, how wretched he (<font color='blue'><b>AUDLEY</b></font>) will be,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) thought. But intermingled with that thought there was another--there was the thought of her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) lovely face, her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) bewitching manner, her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) arch smile, her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) low, musical laugh, which was like a peal of silvery bells ringing across a broad expanse of flat meadow-land and a rippling river in the misty summer evening. She (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) thought of all these things with a transient thrill of triumph, which was stronger even than her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) terror.

<p/>If Sir Michael Audley lived to be a hundred years old, whatever he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) might learn to believe of her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>), however he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) might grow to despise her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>), would he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) ever be able to disassociate her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) from these attributes? No; a thousand times no. To the last hour of his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) life his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) memory would present her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) to him (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) invested with the loveliness that had first won his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) enthusiastic admiration, his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) devoted affection. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) worst enemies could not rob her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) of that fairy dower which had been so fatal in its influence upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) frivolous mind.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) paced up and down the dressing-room in the silvery lamplight, pondering upon the strange letter which she (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) had received from Robert Audley. She (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) walked backward and forward in that monotonous wandering for some time before she (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) was able to steady her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) thoughts--before she (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) was able to bring the scattered forces of her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) narrow intellect to bear upon the one all-important subject of the threat contained in the barrister's letter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>AUDLEY</b></font>) will do it,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) said, between her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) set teeth--<div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>AUDLEY</b></font>) will do it, unless I get him (<font color='blue'><b>AUDLEY</b></font>) into a lunatic-asylum first; or unless--''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) did not finish the thought in words. She (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) did not even think out the sentence; but some new and unnatural impulse in her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) heart seemed to beat each syllable against her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) breast.

<p/>The thought was this: <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>AUDLEY</b></font>) will do it, unless some strange calamity befalls him (<font color='blue'><b>AUDLEY</b></font>), and silences him (<font color='blue'><b>AUDLEY</b></font>) for ever.''  (<font color='red'><b>lady</b></font>)</div>The red blood flashed up into my lady's face with as sudden and transient a blaze as the flickering flame of a fire, and died as suddenly away, leaving her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) more pale than winter snow. Her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) hands, which had before been locked convulsively together, fell apart and dropped heavily at her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) sides. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) stopped in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) rapid pacing to and fro--stopped as Lot's wife may have stopped, after that fatal backward glance at the perishing city--with every pulse slackening, with every drop of blood congealing in her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) veins, in the terrible process that was to transform her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) from a woman into a statue.

<p/>Lady Audley stood still for about five minutes in that strangely statuesque attitude, her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) head erect, her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) eyes staring straight before her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>)--staring far beyond the narrow boundary of her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) chamber wall, into dark distances of peril and horror.

<p/>But by-and-by she (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) started from that rigid attitude almost as abruptly as she (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) had fallen into it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) roused herself from that semi-lethargy. She (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) walked rapidly to her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) dressing-table, and, seating herself before it, pushed away the litter of golden-stoppered bottles and delicate china essence-boxes, and looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) reflection in the large, oval glass. She (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) was very pale; but there was no other trace of agitation visible in her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) girlish face. The lines of her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) exquisitely molded lips were so beautiful, that it was only a very close observer who could have perceived a certain rigidity that was unusual to them. She (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) saw this herself, and tried to smile away that statue-like immobility: but to-night the rosy lips refused to obey her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>); they were firmly locked, and were no longer the slaves of her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) will and pleasure. All the latent forces of her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) character concentrated themselves in this one feature. She (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) might command her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) eyes, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) could not control the muscles of her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) mouth. She (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) rose from before her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) dressing-table, and took a dark velvet cloak and bonnet from the recesses of her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) wardrobe, and dressed herself for walking. The little ormolu clock on the chimney-piece struck the quarter after eleven while Lady Audley was employed in this manner; five minutes afterward she (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) re-entered the room in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) had left Phoebe Marks.

<p/>The innkeeper's wife was sitting before the low fender very much in the same attitude as that in which her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) late mistress had brooded over that lonely hearth earlier in the evening. Phoebe had replenished the fire, and had reassumed her (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) bonnet and shawl. She (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) was anxious to get home to that brutal husband, who was only too apt to fall into some mischief in her (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) absence. She (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) looked up as Lady Audley entered the room, and uttered an exclamation of surprise at seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) late mistress in a walking-costume.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My lady,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) cried, <div class="bookquote">``you are not going out to-night?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I am, Phoebe,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Audley/LADY AUDLEY</b></font>)</div>Lady Audley answered, very quietly. <div class="bookquote">``I am going to Mount Stanning with you to see this bailiff, and to pay and dismiss him (<font color='blue'><b>bailiff</b></font>) myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But, my lady, you forget what the time is; you can't go out at such an hour.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Audley/LADY AUDLEY</b></font>)</div><p/>Lady Audley did not answer. She (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) stood with her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) finger resting lightly upon the handle of the bell, meditating quietly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The stables are always locked, and the men in bed by ten o'clock,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) murmured, <div class="bookquote">``when we are at home. It will make a terrible hubbub to get a carriage ready; but yet I dare say one of the servants could manage the matter quietly for me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But why should you go to-night, my lady?''  (<font color='red'><b>Phoebe/Phoebe Marks/PHOEBE</b></font>)</div>cried Phoebe Marks. <div class="bookquote">``To-morrow will do quite as well. A week hence will do as well. Our landlord would take the man away if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had your promise to settle the debt.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Audley/LADY AUDLEY</b></font>)</div><p/>Lady Audley took no notice of this interruption. She (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) went hastily into the dressing-room, and flung off her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) bonnet and cloak, and then returned to the boudoir, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) simple dinner-costume, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) curls brushed carelessly away from her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, Phoebe Marks, listen to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) said, grasping her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) confidante's wrist, and speaking in a low, earnest voice, but with a certain imperious air that challenged contradiction and commanded obedience. <div class="bookquote">``Listen to me, Phoebe,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) repeated. <div class="bookquote">``I am going to the Castle Inn to-night; whether it is early or late is of very little consequence to me; I have set my mind upon going, and I shall go. You have asked me why, and I have told you. I am going in order that I may pay this debt myself; and that I may see for myself that the money I give is applied to the purpose for which I give it. There is nothing out of the common course of life in my doing this. I am going to do what other women in my position very often do. I am going to assist a favorite servant.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But it's getting on for twelve o'clock, my lady,''  (<font color='red'><b>Phoebe/Phoebe Marks/PHOEBE</b></font>)</div>pleaded Phoebe.

<p/>Lady Audley frowned impatiently at this interruption.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If my going to your house to pay this man should be known,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) continued, still retaining her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) hold of Phoebe's wrist, <div class="bookquote">``I am ready to answer for my conduct; but I would rather that the business should be kept quiet. I think that I can leave this house without being seen by any living creature, if you will do as I tell you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Phoebe/Phoebe Marks/PHOEBE</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will do anything you wish, my lady,''  (<font color='red'><b>Phoebe/Phoebe Marks/PHOEBE</b></font>)</div>answered Phoebe, submissively.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then you will wish me good-night presently, when my maid comes into the room, and you will suffer her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) to show you out of the house. You will cross the courtyard and wait for me in the avenue upon the other side of the archway. It may be half an hour before I am able to join you, for I must not leave my room till the servants have all gone to bed, but you may wait for me patiently, for come what may I will join you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Audley/LADY AUDLEY</b></font>)</div><p/>Lady Audley's face was no longer pale. An unnatural luster gleamed in her (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) great blue eyes. She (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) spoke with an unnatural rapidity. She (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) had altogether the appearance and manner of a person who has yielded to the dominant influence of some overpowering excitement. Phoebe Marks stared at her (<font color='blue'><b>Marks</b></font>) late mistress in mute bewilderment. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marks</b></font>) began to fear that my lady was going mad.

<p/>The bell which Lady Audley rang was answered by the smart lady's-maid who wore rose-colored ribbons, and black silk gowns, and other adornments which were unknown to the humble people who sat below the salt in the good old days when servants wore linsey-woolsey.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I did not know that it was so late, Martin,''  (<font color='red'><b>lady</b></font>)</div>said my lady, in that gentle tone which always won for her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) the willing service of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) inferiors. <div class="bookquote">``I have been talking with Mrs. Marks and have let the time slip by me. I sha'n't want anything to-night, so you may go to bed when you please.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you, my lady,''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>answered the girl, who looked very sleepy, and had some difficulty in repressing a yawn even in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) mistress' presence, for the Audley household usually kept very early hours. <div class="bookquote">``I'd better show Mrs. Marks out, my lady, hadn't I?''  (<font color='red'><b>the maid</b></font>)</div>asked the maid, <div class="bookquote">``before I go to bed?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the maid</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes, to be sure; you can let Phoebe out. All the other servants have gone to bed, then, I suppose?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, my lady.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Audley/LADY AUDLEY</b></font>)</div><p/>Lady Audley laughed as she (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) glanced at the timepiece.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We have been terrible dissipated up here, Phoebe,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Good-night. You may tell your husband that his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) rent shall be paid.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you very much, my lady, and good-night,''  (<font color='red'><b>Phoebe/Phoebe Marks/PHOEBE</b></font>)</div>murmured Phoebe as she (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) backed out of the room, followed by the lady's maid.

<p/>Lady Audley listened at the door, waiting till the muffled sounds of their footsteps died away in the octagon chamber and on the carpeted staircase.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Martin sleeps at the top of the house,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``half a mile away from this room. In ten minutes I may safely make my escape.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) went back into her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) dressing-room, and put on her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) cloak and bonnet for the second time. The unnatural color still burnt like a flame in her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) cheeks; the unnatural light still glittered in her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) eyes. The excitement which she (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) was under held her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) in so strong a spell that neither her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) mind nor her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) body seemed to have any consciousness of fatigue. However verbose I may be in my description of her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) feelings, I can never describe a tithe of her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) thoughts or her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) sufferings. She (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) suffered agonies that would fill closely printed volumes, bulky with a thousand pages, in that one horrible night. She (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) underwent volumes of anguish, and doubt, and perplexity; sometimes repeating the same chapters of her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) torments over and over again; sometimes hurrying through a thousand pages of her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) misery without one pause, without one moment of breathing time. She (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) stood by the low fender in her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) boudoir, watching the minute-hand of the clock, and waiting till it should be time for her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) to leave the house in safety.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I will wait ten minutes,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``not a moment beyond, before I enter on my new peril.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) listened to the wild roaring of the March wind, which seemed to have risen with the stillness and darkness of the night.

<p/>The hand slowly made its inevitable way to the figures which told that the ten minutes were past. It was exactly a quarter to twelve when my lady took her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) lamp in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) hand, and stole softly from the room. Her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) footfall was as light as that of some graceful wild animal, and there was no fear of that airy step awakening any echo upon the carpeted stone corridors and staircase. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) did not pause until she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) reached the vestibule upon the ground floor. Several doors opened out of the vestibule, which was octagon, like my lady's ante-chamber. One of these doors led into the library, and it was this door which Lady Audley opened softly and cautiously.

<p/>To have attempted to leave the house secretly by any of the principal outlets would have been simple madness, for the housekeeper herself superintended the barricading of the great doors, back and front. The secrets of the bolts, and bars, and chains, and bells which secured these doors, and provided for the safety of Sir Michael Audley's plate-room, the door of which was lined with sheet-iron, were known only to the servants who had to deal with them. But although all these precautions were taken with the principal entrances to the citadel, a wooden shutter and a slender iron bar, light enough to be lifted by a child, were considered sufficient safeguard for the half-glass door which opened out of the breakfast-room into the graveled pathway and smooth turf in the courtyard.

<p/>It was by this outlet that Lady Audley meant to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) escape. She (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) could easily remove the bar and unfasten the shutter, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) might safely venture to leave the window ajar while she (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) was absent. There was little fear of Sir Michael's awaking for some time, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) was a heavy sleeper in the early part of the night, and had slept more heavily than usual since his (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) illness.

<p/>Lady Audley crossed the library, and opened the door of the breakfast-room, which communicated with it. This latter apartment was one of the later additions to the Court. It was a simple, cheerful chamber, with brightly papered walls and pretty maple furniture, and was more occupied by Alicia than any one else. The paraphernalia of that young lady's favorite pursuits were scattered about the room--drawing-materials, unfinished scraps of work, tangled skeins of silk, and all the other tokens of a careless damsel's presence; while Miss Audley's picture--a pretty crayon sketch of a rosy-faced hoyden in a riding-habit and hat--hung over the quaint Wedgewood ornaments on the chimneypiece. My lady looked upon these familiar objects with scornful hatred flaming in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) blue eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How glad she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) will be if any disgrace befalls me,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) thought; <div class="bookquote">``how she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) will rejoice if I am driven out of this house!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Lady Audley set the lamp upon a table near the fireplace, and went to the window. She (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) removed the iron-bar and the light wooden shutter, and then opened the glass-door. The March night was black and moonless, and a gust of wind blew in upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) opened this door, and filled the room with its chilly breath, extinguishing the lamp upon the table.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No matter,''  (<font color='red'><b>lady</b></font>)</div>my lady muttered, <div class="bookquote">``I could not have left it burning. I shall know how to find my way through the house when I come back. I have left all the doors ajar.''

 (<font color='red'><b>lady</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) stepped quickly out upon the smooth gravel, and closed the glass-door behind her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was afraid lest that treacherous wind should blow-to the door opening into the library, and thus betray her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>).

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was in the quadrangle now, with that chill wind sweeping against her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), and swirling her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) silken garments round her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) with a shrill, rustling noise, like the whistling of a sharp breeze against the sails of a yacht. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) crossed the quadrangle and looked back--looked back for a moment at the firelight gleaming between the rosy-tinted curtains in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) boudoir, and the dim gleam of the lamp through the mullioned windows in the room where Sir Michael Audley lay asleep.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I feel as if I were running away,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) thought; <div class="bookquote">``I feel as if I were running away secretly in the dead of the night, to lose myself and be forgotten. Perhaps it would be wiser in me to run away, to take this man's warning, and escape out of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) power forever. If I were to run away and disappear as--as George Talboys disappeared. But where could I go? what would become of me? I have no money; my jewels are not worth a couple of hundred pounds, now that I have got rid of the best part of them. What could I do? I must go back to the old life, the old, hard, cruel, wretched life--the life of poverty, and humiliation, and vexation, and discontent. I should have to go back and wear myself out in that long struggle, and die--as my mother died, perhaps!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>My lady stood still for a moment on the smooth lawn between the quadrangle and the archway, with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) head drooping upon her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) breast and her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) hands locked together, debating this question in the unnatural activity of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) mind. Her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) attitude reflected the state of that mind--it expressed irresolution and perplexity. But presently a sudden change came over her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) lifted her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) head--lifted it with an action of defiance and determination.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No! Mr. Robert Audley,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said, aloud, in a low, clear voice; <div class="bookquote">``I will not go back--I will not go back. If the struggle between us is to be a duel to the death, you shall not find me drop my weapon.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) walked with a firm and rapid step under the archway. As she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) passed under that massive arch, it seemed as if she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) disappeared into some black gulf that had waited open to receive her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>). The stupid clock struck twelve, and the whole archway seemed to vibrate under its heavy strokes, as Lady Audley emerged upon the other side and joined Phoebe Marks, who had waited for her (<font color='blue'><b>Marks</b></font>) late mistress very near the gateway of the Court.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, Phoebe,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Marks</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``it is three miles from here to Mount Stanning, isn't it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, my lady.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then we can walk the distance in an hour and a half.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Audley/LADY AUDLEY</b></font>)</div><p/>Lady Audley had not stopped to say this; she (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) was walking quickly along the avenue with her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) humble companion by her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) side. Fragile and delicate as she (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) was in appearance, she (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) was a very good walker. She (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) had been in the habit of taking long country rambles with Mr. Dawson's children in her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) old days of dependence, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) thought very little of a distance of three miles.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your beautiful husband will sit up for you, I suppose, Phoebe?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) said, as they struck across an open field that was used as a short cut from Audley Court to the high-road.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes, my lady; he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)'s sure to sit up. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)'ll be drinking with the man, I dare say.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The man! What man?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The man that's in possession, my lady.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, to be sure,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Audley/LADY AUDLEY</b></font>)</div>said Lady Audley, indifferently.

<p/>It was strange that Phoebe's domestic troubles should seem so very far away from her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) thoughts at the time she (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) was taking such an extraordinary step toward setting things right at the Castle Inn.

<p/>The two women crossed the field and turned into the high road. The way to Mount Stanning was all up hill, and the long road looked black and dreary in the dark night; but my lady walked on with a desperate courage, which was no common constituent in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) selfish sensuous nature, but a strange faculty born out of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) great despair. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) did not speak again to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) companion until they were close upon the glimmering lights at the top of the hill. One of these village lights, glaring redly through a crimson curtain, marked out the particular window behind which it was likely that Luke Marks sat nodding drowsily over his (<font color='blue'><b>Marks</b></font>) liquor, and waiting for the coming of his (<font color='blue'><b>Marks</b></font>) wife.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has not gone to bed, Phoebe,''  (<font color='red'><b>lady</b></font>)</div>said my lady, eagerly. <div class="bookquote">``But there is no other light burning at the inn. I suppose Mr. Audley is in bed and asleep.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, my lady, I suppose so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) was going to stay at the Castle to night?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes, my lady. I helped the girl to get his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) room ready before I came away.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The wind, boisterous everywhere, was even shriller and more pitiless in the neighborhood of that bleak hill-top upon which the Castle Inn reared its rickety walls. The cruel blasts raved wildly round that frail erection. They disported themselves with the shattered pigeon-house, the broken weathercock, the loose tiles, and unshapely chimneys; they rattled at the window-panes, and whistled in the crevices; they mocked the feeble building from foundation to roof, and battered, and banged, and tormented it in their fierce gambols, until it trembled and rocked with the force of their rough play.

<p/>Mr. Luke Marks had not troubled himself to secure the door of his (<font color='blue'><b>Marks</b></font>) dwelling-house before sitting down to booze with the man who held provisional possession of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) goods and chattels. The landlord of the Castle Inn was a lazy, sensual brute, who had no thought higher than a selfish concern for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own enjoyments, and a virulent hatred for anybody who stood in the way of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) gratification.

<p/>Phoebe pushed open the door with her (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) hand, and went into the house, followed by my lady. The gas was flaring in the bar, and smoking the low plastered ceiling. The door of the bar-parlor was half open, and Lady Audley heard the brutal laughter of Mr. Marks as she (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) crossed the threshold of the inn.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) you're here, my lady,''  (<font color='red'><b>Phoebe/Phoebe Marks/PHOEBE</b></font>)</div>whispered Phoebe to her (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) late mistress. <div class="bookquote">``I know he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>)'ll be tipsy. You--you won't be offended, my lady, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) should say anything rude? You know it wasn't my wish that you should come.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Audley/LADY AUDLEY</b></font>)</div>answered Lady Audley, impatiently, <div class="bookquote">``I know that. What should I care for his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) rudeness! Let him (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) say what he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) likes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Audley/LADY AUDLEY</b></font>)</div><p/>Phoebe Marks pushed open the parlor door, leaving my lady in the bar close behind her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>).

<p/>Luke sat with his (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) clumsy legs stretched out upon the hearth. He (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) held a glass of gin-and-water in one hand and the poker in the other. He (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) had just thrust the poker into a heap of black coals, and was scattering them to make a blaze, when his (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) wife appeared upon the threshold of the room.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) snatched the poker from between the bars, and made a half drunken, half threatening motion with it as he (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So you've condescended to come home at last, ma'am,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``I thought you was never coming no more.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) spoke in a thick and drunken voice, and was by no means too intelligible. He (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) was steeped to the very lips in alcohol. His (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) eyes were dim and watery; his (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) hands were unsteady; his (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) voice was choked and muffled with drink. A brute, even when most sober; a brute, even on his (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) best behavior, he (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) was ten times more brutal in his (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) drunkenness, when the few restraints which held his (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) ignorant, every day brutality in check were flung aside in the indolent recklessness of intoxication.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I--I've been longer than I intended to be, Luke,''  (<font color='red'><b>Phoebe/Phoebe Marks/PHOEBE</b></font>)</div>Phoebe answered, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) most conciliatory manner; <div class="bookquote">``but I've seen my lady, and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)'s been very kind, and--and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)'ll settle this business for us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Phoebe/Phoebe Marks/PHOEBE</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)'s been very kind, has she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Luke/Luke Marks/Mr. Marks</b></font>)</div>muttered Mr. Marks, with a drunken laugh; <div class="bookquote">``thank her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) for nothing. I know the vally of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) kindness. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)'d be oncommon kind, I dessay, if she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) warn't obligated to be it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Luke/Luke Marks/Mr. Marks</b></font>)</div><p/>The man in possession, who had fallen into a maudlin and semi-unconscious state of intoxication upon about a third of the liquor that Mr. Marks had consumed, only stared in feeble wonderment at his (<font color='blue'><b>Marks</b></font>) host and hostess. He (<font color='blue'><b>Marks</b></font>) sat near the table. Indeed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Marks</b></font>) had hooked himself on to it with his (<font color='blue'><b>Marks</b></font>) elbows, as a safeguard against sliding under it, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Marks</b></font>) was making imbecile attempts to light his (<font color='blue'><b>Marks</b></font>) pipe at the flame of a guttering tallow candle near him (<font color='blue'><b>Marks</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My lady has promised to settle the business for us, Luke,''  (<font color='red'><b>Phoebe/Phoebe Marks/PHOEBE</b></font>)</div>Phoebe repeated, without noticing Luke's remarks. She (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) knew her (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) husband's dogged nature well enough by this time to know that it was worse than useless to try to stop him (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) from doing or saying anything which his (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) own stubborn will led him (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) to do or say. <div class="bookquote">``My lady will settle it,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)'s come down here to see about it to-night,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) added.

<p/>The poker dropped from the landlord's hand, and fell clattering among the cinders on the hearth.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My Lady Audley come here to-night!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Luke.''

 (<font color='red'><b>lady</b></font>)</div><p/>My lady appeared upon the threshold of the door as Phoebe spoke.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Luke Marks,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I have come to pay this man, and to send him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) about his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) business.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Lady Audley said these words in a strange, semi-mechanical manner; very much as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) had learned the sentence by rote, and were repeating it without knowing what she (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) said.

<p/>Mr. Marks gave a discontented growl, and set his (<font color='blue'><b>Marks</b></font>) empty glass down upon the table with an impatient gesture.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You might have given the money to Phoebe,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Marks</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``as well as have brought it yourself. We don't want no fine ladies up here, pryin' and pokin' their precious noses into everythink.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Luke, Luke!''  (<font color='red'><b>Phoebe/Phoebe Marks/PHOEBE</b></font>)</div>remonstrated Phoebe, <div class="bookquote">``when my lady has been so kind!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Phoebe/Phoebe Marks/PHOEBE</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, damn her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) kindness!''  (<font color='red'><b>Luke/Luke Marks/Mr. Marks</b></font>)</div>cried Mr. Marks; <div class="bookquote">``it ain't her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) kindness as we want, gal, it's her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) money. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) won't get no snivelin' gratitood from me. Whatever she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) does for us she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) does because she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) is obliged; and if she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) wasn't obliged she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) wouldn't do it--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Luke/Luke Marks/Mr. Marks</b></font>)</div><p/>Heaven knows how much more Luke Marks might have said, had not my lady turned upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Marks</b></font>) suddenly and awed him (<font color='blue'><b>Marks</b></font>) into silence by the unearthly glitter of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) beauty. Her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) hair had been blown away from her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) face, and being of a light, feathery quality, had spread itself into a tangled mass that surrounded her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) forehead like a yellow flame. There was another flame in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) eyes--a greenish light, such as might flash from the changing-hued orbs of an angry mermaid.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Stop,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mermaid</b></font>) cried. <div class="bookquote">``I didn't come up here in the dead of night to listen to your insolence. How much is this debt?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nine pound.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Audley/LADY AUDLEY</b></font>)</div><p/>Lady Audley produced her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) purse--a toy of ivory, silver, and turquoise--she (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) took from it a note and four sovereigns. She (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) laid these upon the table.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let that man give me a receipt for the money,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``before I go.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>It was some time before the man could be roused into sufficient consciousness for the performance of this simple duty, and it was only by dipping a pen into the ink and pushing it between his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) clumsy fingers, that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was at last made to comprehend that his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) autograph was wanted at the bottom of the receipt which had been made out by Phoebe Marks. Lady Audley took the document as soon as the ink was dry, and turned to leave the parlor. Phoebe followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You mustn't go home alone, my lady,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``You'll let me go with you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, yes; you shall go home with me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The women</b></font>)</div><p/>The two women were standing near the door of the inn as my lady said this. Phoebe stared wonderingly at her (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) patroness. She (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) had expected that Lady Audley would be in a hurry to return home after settling this business which she (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) had capriciously taken upon herself; but it was not so; my lady stood leaning against the inn door and staring into vacancy, and again Mrs. Marks began to fear that trouble had driven her (<font color='blue'><b>Marks</b></font>) late mistress mad.

<p/>A little Dutch clock in the bar struck two while Lady Audley lingered in this irresolute, absent manner. She (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) started at the sound and began to tremble violently.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think I am going to faint, Phoebe,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``where can I get some cold water?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The pump is in the wash-house, my lady; I'll run and get you a glass of cold water.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no, no,''  (<font color='red'><b>lady</b></font>)</div>cried my lady, clutching Phoebe's arm as she (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) was about to run away upon this errand; <div class="bookquote">``I'll get it myself. I must dip my head in a basin of water if I want to save myself from fainting. In which room does Mr. Audley sleep?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>There was something so irrelevant in this question that Phoebe Marks stared aghast at her (<font color='blue'><b>Marks</b></font>) mistress before she (<font color='blue'><b>Marks</b></font>) answered it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It was number three that I got ready, my lady--the front room--the room next to ours,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Marks</b></font>) replied, after that pause of astonishment.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Give me a candle,''  (<font color='red'><b>lady</b></font>)</div>said my lady. <div class="bookquote">``I'll go into your room, and get some water for my head; stay where you are, and see that that brute of a husband of yours does not follow me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) snatched the candle which Phoebe had lighted from the girl's hand and ran up the rickety, winding staircase which led to the narrow corridor upon the upper floor. Five bed-rooms opened out of this low-ceilinged, close-smelling corridor; the numbers of these rooms were indicated by squat black figures painted upon the panels of the doors. Lady Audley had driven up to Mount Stanning to inspect the house when she (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) bought the business for her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) servant's bridegroom, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) knew her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) way about the dilapidated old place; she (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) knew where to find Phoebe's bedroom, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) stopped before the door of that other chamber which had been prepared for Mr. Robert Audley.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) stopped and looked at the number on the door. The key was in the lock, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) hand dropped upon it as if unconsciously. But presently she (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) suddenly began to tremble again, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) had trembled a few minutes before at the striking of the clock. She (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) stood for a few moments trembling thus, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) hand still upon the key; then a horrible expression came over her (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) face, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) turned the key in the lock. She (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) turned it twice, double locking the door.

<p/>There was no sound from within; the occupant of the chamber made no sign of having heard that ominous creaking of the rusty key in the rusty lock.

<p/>Lady Audley hurried into the next room. She (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) set the candle on the dressing-table, flung off her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) bonnet and slung it loosely across her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) arm; then she (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) went to the wash-stand and filled the basin with water. She (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) plunged her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) golden hair into this water, and then stood for a few moments in the center of the room looking about her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>), with a white, earnest face, and an eager gaze that seemed to take in every object in the poorly furnished chamber. Phoebe's bedroom was certainly very shabbily furnished; she (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) had been compelled to select all the most decent things for those best bedrooms which were set apart for any chance traveler who might stop for a night's lodging at the Castle Inn; but Phoebe Marks had done her (<font color='blue'><b>Marks</b></font>) best to atone for the lack of substantial furniture in her (<font color='blue'><b>Marks</b></font>) apartment by a superabundance of drapery. Crisp curtains of cheap chintz hung from the tent-bedstead; festooned drapery of the same material shrouded the narrow window shutting out the light of day, and affording a pleasant harbor for tribes of flies and predatory bands of spiders. Even the looking-glass, a miserably cheap construction which distorted every face whose owner had the hardihood to look into it, stood upon a draperied altar of starched muslin and pink glazed calico, and was adorned with frills of lace and knitted work.

<p/>My lady smiled as she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) looked at the festoons and furbelows which met her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) eyes upon every side. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had reason, perhaps, to smile, remembering the costly elegance of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) own apartments; but there was something in that sardonic smile that seemed to have a deeper meaning than any natural contempt for Phoebe's attempts at decoration. She (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) went to the dressing-table and, smoothed her (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) wet hair before the looking-glass, and then put on her (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) bonnet. She (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) was obliged to place the flaming tallow candle very close to the lace furbelows about the glass; so close that the starched muslin seemed to draw the flame toward it by some power of attraction in its fragile tissue.

<p/>Phoebe waited anxiously by the inn door for my lady's coming She (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) watched the minute hand of the little Dutch clock, wondering at the slowness of its progress. It was only ten minutes past two when Lady Audley came down-stairs, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) bonnet on and her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) hair still wet, but without the candle.

<p/>Phoebe was immediately anxious about this missing candle.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The light, my lady,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``you have left it up-stairs!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The wind blew it out as I was leaving your room,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Audley/LADY AUDLEY</b></font>)</div>Lady Audley answered, quietly. <div class="bookquote">``I left it there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In my room, my lady?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And it was quite out?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I tell you; why do you worry me about your candle? It is past two o'clock. Come.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) took the girl's arm, and half led, half dragged her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) from the house. The convulsive pressure of her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) slight hand held her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) firmly as an iron vise could have held her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>). The fierce March wind banged to the door of the house, and left the two women standing outside it. The long, black road lay bleak and desolate before them, dimly visible between straight lines of leafless hedges.

<p/>A walk of three miles' length upon a lonely country road, between the hours of two and four on a cold winter's morning, is scarcely a pleasant task for a delicate woman--a woman whose inclinations lean toward ease and luxury. But my lady hurried along the hard, dry highway, dragging her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) companion with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) as if she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had been impelled by some horrible demoniac force which knew no abatement. With the black night above them--with the fierce wind howling around them, sweeping across a broad expanse of hidden country, blowing as if it had arisen simultaneously from every point of the compass, and making those wanderers the focus of its ferocity--the two women walked through the darkness down the hill upon which Mount Stanning stood, along a mile and a half of flat road, and then up another hill, on the western side of which Audley Court lay in that sheltered valley, which seemed to shut in the old house from all the clamor and hubbub of the everyday world.

<p/>My lady stopped upon the summit of this hill to draw breath and to clasp her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) hands upon her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) heart, in the vain hope that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) might still its cruel beating. They were now within three-quarters of a mile of the Court, and they had been walking for nearly an hour since they had left the Castle Inn.

<p/>Lady Audley stopped to rest, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) face still turned toward the place of her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) destination. Phoebe Marks, stopping also, and very glad of a moment's pause in that hurried journey, looked back into the far darkness beneath which lay that dreary shelter that had given her (<font color='blue'><b>Marks</b></font>) so much uneasiness. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Marks</b></font>) did so, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marks</b></font>) uttered a shrill cry of horror, and clutched wildly at her (<font color='blue'><b>Marks</b></font>) companion's cloak.

<p/>The night sky was no longer all dark. The thick blackness was broken by one patch of lurid light.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My lady, my lady!''  (<font color='red'><b>Phoebe/Phoebe Marks/PHOEBE</b></font>)</div>cried Phoebe, pointing to this lurid patch; <div class="bookquote">``do you see?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Phoebe/Phoebe Marks/PHOEBE</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, child, I see,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Audley/LADY AUDLEY</b></font>)</div>answered Lady Audley, trying to shake the clinging hands from her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) garments. <div class="bookquote">``What's the matter?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's a fire--a fire, my lady!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I am afraid it is a fire. At Brentwood, most likely. Let me go, Phoebe; it's nothing to us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, yes, my lady; it's nearer than Brentwood--much nearer; it's at Mount Stanning.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Audley/LADY AUDLEY</b></font>)</div><p/>Lady Audley did not answer. She (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) was trembling again, with the cold perhaps, for the wind had torn her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) heavy cloak from her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) shoulders, and had left her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) slender figure exposed to the blast.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's at Mount Stanning, my lady!''  (<font color='red'><b>Phoebe/Phoebe Marks/PHOEBE</b></font>)</div>cried Phoebe Marks. <div class="bookquote">``It's the Castle that's on fire--I know it is, I know it is! I thought of fire to-night, and I was fidgety and uneasy, for I knew this would happen some day. I wouldn't mind if it was only the wretched place, but there'll be life lost, there'll be life lost!''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>sobbed the girl, distractedly. <div class="bookquote">``There's Luke, too tipsy to help himself, unless others help him (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>); there's Mr. Audley asleep--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Phoebe/Phoebe Marks/PHOEBE</b></font>)</div><p/>Phoebe Marks stopped suddenly at the mention of Robert's name, and fell upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Marks</b></font>) knees, clasping her (<font color='blue'><b>Marks</b></font>) uplifted hands, and appealing wildly to Lady Audley.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, my God!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) cried. <div class="bookquote">``Say it's not true, my lady, say it's not true! It's too horrible, it's too horrible, it's too horrible!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What's too horrible?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The thought that's in my mind; the terrible thought that's in my mind.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you mean, girl?''  (<font color='red'><b>lady</b></font>)</div>cried my lady, fiercely.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, God forgive me if I'm wrong!''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>the kneeling woman gasped in detached sentences, <div class="bookquote">``and God grant I may be. Why did you go up to the Castle, my lady? Why were you so set on going against all I could say--you who are so bitter against Mr. Audley and against Luke, and who knew they were both under that roof? Oh, tell me that I do you a cruel wrong, my lady; tell me so--tell me! for as there is a Heaven above me I think that you went to that place to-night on purpose to set fire to it. Tell me that I'm wrong, my lady; tell me that I'm doing you a wicked wrong.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will tell you nothing, except that you are a mad woman,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Audley/LADY AUDLEY</b></font>)</div>answered Lady Audley; in a cold, hard voice. <div class="bookquote">``Get up; fool, idiot, coward! Is your husband such a precious bargain that you should be groveling there, lamenting and groaning for him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)? What is Robert Audley to you, that you behave like a maniac, because you think he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) is in danger? How do you know the fire is at Mount Stanning? You see a red patch in the sky, and you cry out directly that your own paltry hovel is in flames, as if there were no place in the world that could burn except that. The fire may be at Brentwood, or further away--at Romford, or still further away, on the eastern side of London, perhaps. Get up, mad woman, and go back and look after your goods and chattels, and your husband and your lodger. Get up and go: I don't want you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! my lady, my lady, forgive me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Phoebe/Phoebe Marks/PHOEBE</b></font>)</div>sobbed Phoebe; <div class="bookquote">``there's nothing you can say to me that's hard enough for having done you such a wrong, even in my thoughts. I don't mind your cruel words--I don't mind anything if I'm wrong.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Phoebe/Phoebe Marks/PHOEBE</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Go back and see for yourself,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Audley/LADY AUDLEY</b></font>)</div>answered Lady Audley, sternly. <div class="bookquote">``I tell you again, I don't want you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) walked away in the darkness, leaving Phoebe Marks still kneeling upon the hard road, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Marks</b></font>) had cast herself in that agony of supplication. Sir Michael's wife walked toward the house in which her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) husband slept with the red blaze lighting up the skies behind her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), and with nothing but the blackness of the night before.

<p/>CHAPTER XXXIII.

<p/>THE BEARER OF THE TIDINGS.

<p/>It was very late the next morning when Lady Audley emerged from her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) dressing-room, exquisitely dressed in a morning costume of delicate muslin, delicate laces, and embroideries; but with a very pale face, and with half-circles of purple shadow under her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) eyes. She (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) accounted for this pale face and these hollow eyes by declaring that she (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) had sat up reading until a very late hour on the previous night.

<p/>Sir Michael and his (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) young wife breakfasted in the library at a comfortable round table, wheeled close to the blazing fire; and Alicia was compelled to share this meal with her (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) step-mother, however she (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) might avoid that lady in the long interval between breakfast and dinner.

<p/>The March morning was bleak and dull, and a drizzling rain fell incessantly, obscuring the landscape and blotting out the distance. There were very few letters by the morning post; the daily newspapers did not arrive until noon; and such aids to conversation being missing, there was very little talk at the breakfast table.

<p/>Alicia looked out at the drizzling rain drifting against the broad window-panes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No riding to-day,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``and no chance of any callers to enliven us, unless that ridiculous Bob comes crawling through the wet from Mount Stanning.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Have you ever heard anybody, whom you knew to be dead, alluded to in a light, easy going manner by another person who did not know of his (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) death--alluded to as doing that or this, as performing some trivial everyday operation--when you know that he (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) has vanished away from the face of this earth, and separated himself forever from all living creatures and their commonplace pursuits in the awful solemnity of death? Such a chance allusion, insignificant though it may be, is apt to send a strange thrill of pain through the mind. The ignorant remark jars discordantly upon the hyper-sensitive brain; the King of Terrors is desecrated by that unwitting disrespect. Heaven knows what hidden reason my lady may have had for experiencing some such revulsion of feeling on the sudden mention of Mr. Audley's name, but her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) pale face blanched to a sickly white as Alicia Audley spoke of her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) cousin.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) will come down here in the wet, perhaps,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>the young lady continued, <div class="bookquote">``with his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) hat sleek and shining as if it had been brushed with a pat of fresh butter, and with white vapors steaming out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) clothes, and making him (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) look like an awkward genie just let out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) bottle. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) will come down here and print impressions of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) muddy boots all over the carpet, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>)'ll sit on your Gobelin tapestry, my lady, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) wet overcoat; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>)'ll abuse you if you remonstrate, and will ask why people have chairs that are not to be sat upon, and why you don't live in Figtree Court, and--''

 (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div><p/>Sir Michael Audley watched his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) daughter with a thoughtful countenance as she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) talked of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) cousin. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) very often talked of him (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>), ridiculing him (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) and inveighing against him (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) in no very measured terms. But perhaps the baronet thought of a certain Signora Beatrice who very cruelly entreated a gentleman called Benedick, but who was, it may be, heartily in love with him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) at the same time.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you think Major Melville told me when he (<font color='blue'><b>Melville</b></font>) called here yesterday, Alicia?''  (<font color='red'><b>Michael/Michael Audley/Audley</b></font>)</div>Sir Michael asked, presently.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I haven't the remotest idea,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alicia/Miss Audley/Miss Alicia</b></font>)</div>replied Alicia, rather disdainfully. <div class="bookquote">``Perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Melville</b></font>) told you that we should have another war before long, by Ged, sir; or perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Ged</b></font>) told you that we should have a new ministry, by Ged, sir, for that those fellows are getting themselves into a mess, sir; or that those other fellows were reforming this, and cutting down that, and altering the other in the army, until, by Ged, sir, we shall have no army at all, by-and-by--nothing but a pack of boys, sir, crammed up to the eyes with a lot of senseless schoolmasters' rubbish, and dressed in shell-jackets and calico helmets. Yes, sir, they're fighting in Oudh in calico helmets at this very day, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You're an impertinent minx, miss,''  (<font color='red'><b>the baronet</b></font>)</div>answered the baronet. <div class="bookquote">``Major Melville told me nothing of the kind; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Melville</b></font>) told me that a very devoted admirer of you, a certain Sir Harry Towers, has forsaken his (<font color='blue'><b>Towers</b></font>) place in Hertfordshire, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Towers</b></font>) hunting stable, and has gone on the continent for a twelvemonths' tour.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Alicia/Miss Audley/Miss Alicia</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Audley flushed up suddenly at the mention of her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) old adorer, but recovered herself very quickly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Towers</b></font>) has gone on the continent, has he (<font color='blue'><b>Towers</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) said indifferently. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Towers</b></font>) told me that he (<font color='blue'><b>Towers</b></font>) meant to do so--if--if he (<font color='blue'><b>Towers</b></font>) didn't have everything his (<font color='blue'><b>Towers</b></font>) own way. Poor fellow! he (<font color='blue'><b>Towers</b></font>)'s a dear, good-hearted, stupid creature, and twenty times better than that peripatetic, patent refrigerator, Mr. Robert Audley.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish, Alicia, you were not so fond of ridiculing Bob,''  (<font color='red'><b>Michael/Michael Audley/Audley</b></font>)</div>Sir Michael said, gravely. <div class="bookquote">``Bob is a good fellow, and I'm as fond of him (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>)'d been my own son; and--and--I've been very uncomfortable about him (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) lately. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) has changed very much within the last few days, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) has taken all sorts of absurd ideas into his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) head, and my lady has alarmed me about him (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) thinks--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Audley/LADY AUDLEY</b></font>)</div><p/>Lady Audley interrupted her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) husband with a grave shake of her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) head.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is better not to say too much about it as yet awhile,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``Alicia knows what I think.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alicia/Miss Audley/Miss Alicia</b></font>)</div>replied Miss Audley, <div class="bookquote">``my lady thinks that Bob is going mad, but I know better than that. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>)'s not at all the sort of person to go mad. How should such a sluggish ditch-pond of an intellect as his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) ever work itself into a tempest? He (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) may move about for the rest of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) life, perhaps, in a tranquil state of semi-idiotcy, imperfectly comprehending who he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) is, and where he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>)'s going, and what he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>)'s doing--but he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>)'ll never go mad.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Alicia/Miss Audley/Miss Alicia</b></font>)</div><p/>Sir Michael did not reply to this. He (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) had been very much disturbed by his (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) conversation with my lady on the previous evening, and had silently debated the painful question, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) mind ever since.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) wife--the woman he (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) best loved and most believed in--had told him (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>), with all appearance of regret and agitation, her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) conviction of his (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) nephew's insanity. He (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) tried in vain to arrive at the conclusion he (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) wished most ardently to attain; he (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) tried in vain to think that my lady was misled by her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) own fancies, and had no foundation for what she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said. But then, again, it suddenly flashed upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>), that to think this was to arrive at a worse conclusion; it was to transfer the horrible suspicion from his (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) nephew to his (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) wife. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) appeared to be possessed with an actual conviction of Robert's insanity. To imagine her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) wrong was to imagine some weakness in her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) own mind. The longer he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) thought of the subject the more it harassed and perplexed him (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>). It was most certain that the young man had always been eccentric. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was sensible, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was tolerably clever, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was honorable and gentlemanlike in feeling, though perhaps a little careless in the performance of certain minor social duties; but there were some slight differences, not easily to be defined, that separated him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) from other men of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) age and position. Then, again, it was equally true that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had very much changed within the period that had succeeded the disappearance of George Talboys. He (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) had grown moody and thoughtful, melancholy and absent-minded. He (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) had held himself aloof from society, had sat for hours without speaking; had talked at other points by fits and starts; and had excited himself unusually in the discussion of subjects which apparently lay far out of the region of his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) own life and interests. Then there was even another region which seemed to strengthen my lady's case against this unhappy young man. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had been brought up in the frequent society of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cousin, Alicia--his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pretty, genial cousin--to whom interest, and one would have thought affection, naturally pointed as his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) most fitting bride. More than this, the girl had shown him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), in the innocent guilelessness of a transparent nature, that on her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) side at least, affection was not wanting; and yet, in spite of all this, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had held himself aloof, and had allowed others to propose for her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) hand, and to be rejected by her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), and had still made no sign.

<p/>Now love is so very subtle an essence, such an indefinable metaphysical marvel, that its due force, though very cruelly felt by the sufferer himself, is never clearly understood by those who look on at its torments and wonder why he (<font color='blue'><b>sufferer</b></font>) takes the common fever so badly. Sir Michael argued that because Alicia was a pretty girl and an amiable girl it was therefore extraordinary and unnatural in Robert Audley not to have duly fallen in love with her (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>). This baronet, who close upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) sixtieth birthday, had for the first time encountered that one woman who out of all the women in the world had power to quicken the pulses of his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) heart, wondered why Robert failed to take the fever from the first breath of contagion that blew toward him (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) forgot that there are men who go their ways unscathed amidst legions of lovely and generous women, to succumb at last before some harsh-featured virago, who knows the secret of that only philter which can intoxicate and bewitch him (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) had forgot that there are certain Jacks who go through life without meeting the Jill appointed for them by Nemesis, and die old bachelors, perhaps, with poor Jill pining an old maid upon the other side of the party-wall. He (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) forgot that love, which is a madness, and a scourge, and a fever, and a delusion, and a snare, is also a mystery, and very imperfectly understood by everyone except the individual sufferer who writhes under its tortures. Jones, who is wildly enamored of Miss Brown, and who lies awake at night until he (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) loathes his (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) comfortable pillow and tumbles his (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) sheets into two twisted rags of linen in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) agonies, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) were a prisoner and wanted to wind them into impromptu ropes; this same Jones who thinks Russell Square a magic place because his (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) divinity inhabits it, who thinks the trees in that inclosure and the sky above it greener and bluer than other trees or sky, and who feels a pang, yes, an actual pang, of mingled hope, and joy, and expectation, and terror, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) emerges from Guilford street, descending from the hights of Islington, into those sacred precincts; this very Jones is hard and callous toward the torments of Smith, who adores Miss Robinson, and cannot imagine what the infatuated fellow can see in the girl. So it was with Sir Michael Audley. He (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) nephew as a sample of a very large class of young men, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) daughter as a sample of an equally extensive class of feminine goods, and could not see why the two samples should not make a very respectable match. He (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) ignored all those infinitesimal differences in nature which make the wholesome food of one man the deadly poison of another. How difficult it is to believe sometimes that a man doesn't like such and such a favorite dish. If at a dinner-party, a meek looking guest refuses early salmon and cucumbers, or green peas in February, we set him (<font color='blue'><b>guest</b></font>) down as a poor relation whose instincts warn him (<font color='blue'><b>guest</b></font>) off those expensive plates. If an alderman were to declare that he (<font color='blue'><b>alderman</b></font>) didn't like green fat, he (<font color='blue'><b>alderman</b></font>) would be looked upon as a social martyr, a Marcus Curtius of the dinner-table, who immolated himself for the benefit of his (<font color='blue'><b>Marcus</b></font>) kind. His (<font color='blue'><b>Marcus</b></font>) fellow-aldermen would believe in anything rather than an heretical distaste for the city ambrosia of the soup tureen. But there are people who dislike salmon, and white-bait, and spring ducklings, and all manner of old-established delicacies, and there are other people who affect eccentric and despicable dishes, generally stigmatized as nasty.

<p/>Alas, my pretty Alicia, your cousin did not love you! He (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) admired your rosy English face, and had a tender affection for you which might perhaps have expanded by-and-by into something warm enough for matrimony, that every-day jog-trot species of union which demands no very passionate devotion, but for a sudden check which it had received in Dorsetshire. Yes, Robert Audley's growing affection for his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) cousin, a plant of very slow growth, I am fain to confess, had been suddenly dwarfed and stunted upon that bitter February day on which he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) had stood beneath the pine-trees talking to Clara Talboys. Since that day the young man had experienced an unpleasant sensation in thinking of poor Alicia. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) as being in some vague manner an incumbrance upon the freedom of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thoughts; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had a haunting fear that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was in some tacit way pledged to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>); that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) had a species of claim upon him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), which forbade to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) the right of thinking of another woman. I believe it was the image of Miss Audley presented to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in this light that goaded the young barrister into those outbursts of splenetic rage against the female sex which he (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) was liable to at certain times. He (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) was strictly honorable, so honorable that he (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) would rather have immolated himself upon the altar of truth and Alicia than have done her (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) the remotest wrong, though by so doing he (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) might have secured his (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) own comfort and happiness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If the poor little girl loves me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) thought, <div class="bookquote">``and if she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) thinks that I love her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), and has been led to think so by any word or act of mine, I'm in duty bound to let her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) think so to the end of time, and to fulfill any tacit promise which I may have unconsciously made. I thought once--I meant once to--to make her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) an offer by-and-by when this horrible mystery about George Talboys should have been cleared up and everything peacefully settled--but now--''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) thoughts would ordinarily wander away at this point of his (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) reflections, carrying him (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) where he (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) never had intended to go; carrying him (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) back under the pine-trees in Dorsetshire, and setting him (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) once more face to face with the sister of his (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) missing friend, and it was generally a very laborious journey by which he (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) traveled back to the point from which he (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) strayed. It was so difficult for him (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) to tear himself away from the stunted turf and the pine-trees.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Poor little girl!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) would think on coming back to Alicia. <div class="bookquote">``How good it is of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) to love me, and how grateful ought I to be for her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) tenderness. How many fellows would think such a generous, loving heart the highest boon that earth could give them. There's Sir Harry Towers stricken with despair at his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) rejection. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) would give me half his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) estate, all his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) estate, twice his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) estate, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had it, to be in the shoes which I am anxious to shake off my ungrateful feet. Why don't I love her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)? Why is it that although I know her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) to be pretty, and pure, and good, and truthful, I don't love her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)? Her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) image never haunts me, except reproachfully. I never see her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) in my dreams. I never wake up suddenly in the dead of the night with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) eyes shining upon me and her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) warm breath upon my cheek, or with the fingers of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) soft hand clinging to mine. No, I'm not in love with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), I can't fall in love with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) raged and rebelled against his (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) ingratitude. He (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) tried to argue himself into a passionate attachment for his (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) cousin, but he (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) failed ignominiously, and the more he (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) tried to think of Alicia the more he (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) thought of Clara Talboys. I am speaking now of his (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) feelings in the period that elapsed between his (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) return from Dorsetshire and his (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) visit to Grange Heath.

<p/>Sir Michael sat by the library fire after breakfast upon this wretched rainy morning, writing letters and reading the newspapers. Alicia shut herself in her (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) own apartment to read the third volume of a novel. Lady Audley locked the door of the octagon ante-chamber, and roamed up and down the suite of rooms from the bedroom to the boudoir all through that weary morning.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) had locked the door to guard against the chance of any one coming in suddenly and observing her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) before she (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) was aware--before she (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) had had sufficient warning to enable her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) to face their scrutiny. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) pale face seemed to grow paler as the morning advanced. A tiny medicine-chest was open upon the dressing-table, and little stoppered bottles of red lavender, sal-volatile, chloroform, chlorodyne, and ether were scattered about. Once my lady paused before this medicine-chest, and took out the remaining bottles, half-absently, perhaps, until she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) came to one which was filled with a thick, dark liquid, and labeled <div class="bookquote">``opium--poison.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) trifled a long time with this last bottle; holding it up to the light, and even removing the stopper and smelling the sickly liquid. But she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) put it from her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) suddenly with a shudder. <div class="bookquote">``If I could!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) muttered, <div class="bookquote">``if I could only do it! And yet why should I now?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) clinched her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) small hands as she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) uttered the last words, and walked to the window of the dressing-room, which looked straight toward that ivied archway under which any one must come who came from Mount Stanning to the Court.

<p/>There were smaller gates in the gardens which led into the meadows behind the Court, but there was no other way of coming from Mount Stanning or Brentwood than by the principal entrance.

<p/>The solitary hand of the clock over the archway was midway between one and two when my lady looked at it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How slow the time is,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said, wearily; <div class="bookquote">``how slow, how slow! Shall I grow old like this, I wonder, with every minute of my life seeming like an hour?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) stood for a few minutes watching the archway, but no one passed under it while she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) looked, and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) turned impatiently away from the window to resume her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) weary wandering about the rooms.

<p/>Whatever fire that had been which had reflected itself vividly in the black sky, no tidings of it had as yet come to Audley Court. The day was miserably wet and windy, altogether the very last day upon which even the most confirmed idler and gossip would care to venture out. It was not a market-day, and there were therefore very few passengers upon the road between Brentwood and Chelmsford, so that as yet no news of the fire, which had occurred in the dead of the wintry night, had reached the village of Audley, or traveled from the village to the Court.

<p/>The girl with the rose-colored ribbons came to the door of the anteroom to summon her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) mistress to luncheon, but Lady Audley only opened the door a little way, and intimated her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) intention of taking no luncheon.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My head aches terribly, Martin,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``I shall go and lie down till dinner-time. You may come at five to dress me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Lady Audley said this with the predetermination of dressing at four, and thus dispensing with the services of her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) attendant. Among all privileged spies, a lady's-maid has the highest privileges; it is she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) who bathes Lady Theresa's eyes with eau-de-cologne after her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) ladyship's quarrel with the colonel; it is she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) who administers sal-volatile to Miss Fanny when Count Beaudesert, of the Blues, has jilted her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) has a hundred methods for the finding out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) mistress' secrets. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) knows by the manner in which her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) victim jerks her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) head from under the hair-brush, or chafes at the gentlest administration of the comb, what hidden tortures are racking her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) breast--what secret perplexities are bewildering her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) brain. That well-bred attendant knows how to interpret the most obscure diagnosis of all mental diseases that can afflict her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) mistress; she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) knows when the ivory complexion is bought and paid for--when the pearly teeth are foreign substances fashioned by the dentist--when the glossy plaits are the relics of the dead, rather than the property of the living; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) knows other and more sacred secrets than these; she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) knows when the sweet smile is more false than Madame Levison's enamel, and far less enduring--when the words that issue from between gates of borrowed pearl are more disguised and painted than the lips which help to shape them--when the lovely fairy of the ball-room re-enters the dressing-room after the night's long revelry, and throws aside her (<font color='blue'><b>fairy</b></font>) voluminous burnous and her (<font color='blue'><b>fairy</b></font>) faded bouquet, and drops her (<font color='blue'><b>fairy</b></font>) mask, and like another Cinderella loses the glass-slipper, by whose glitter she (<font color='blue'><b>Cinderella</b></font>) has been distinguished, and falls back into her (<font color='blue'><b>Cinderella</b></font>) rags and dirt, the lady's maid is by to see the transformation. The valet who took wages from the prophet of Korazin must have seen his (<font color='blue'><b>valet</b></font>) master sometimes unveiled, and must have laughed in his (<font color='blue'><b>valet</b></font>) sleeve at the folly of the monster's worshipers.

<p/>Lady Audley had made no confidante of her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) new maid, and on this day of all others she (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) wished to be alone.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) did lie down; she (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) cast herself wearily upon the luxurious sofa in the dressing-room, and buried her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) face in the down pillows and tried to sleep. Sleep!--she (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) had almost forgotten what it was, that tender restorer of tired nature, it seemed so long now since she (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) had slept. It was only about eight-and-forty hours perhaps, but it appeared an intolerable time. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) fatigue of the night before, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) unnatural excitement, had worn her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) out at last. She (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) did fall asleep; she (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) fell into a heavy slumber that was almost like stupor. She (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) had taken a few drops out of the opium bottle in a glass of water before lying down.

<p/>The clock over the mantelpiece chimed the quarter before four as she (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) woke suddenly and started up, with the cold perspiration breaking out in icy drops upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) forehead. She (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) had dreamt that every member of the household was clamoring at the door, eager to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) of a dreadful fire that had happened in the night.

<p/>There was no sound but the flapping of the ivy-leaves against the glass, the occasional falling of a cinder, and the steady ticking of the clock.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps I shall be always dreaming these sort of dreams,''  (<font color='red'><b>lady</b></font>)</div>my lady thought, <div class="bookquote">``until the terror of them kills me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>lady</b></font>)</div><p/>The rain had ceased, and the cold spring sunshine was glittering upon the windows. Lady Audley dressed herself rapidly but carefully. I do not say that even in her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) supremest hour of misery she (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) still retained her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) pride in her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) beauty. It was not so; she (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) looked upon that beauty as a weapon, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) had now double need to be well armed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) dressed herself in her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) most gorgeous silk, a voluminous robe of silvery, shimmering blue, that made her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) look as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) had been arrayed in moonbeams. She (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) shook out her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) hair into feathery showers of glittering gold, and, with a cloak of white cashmere about her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) shoulders, went down-stairs into the vestibule.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) opened the door of the library and looked in. Sir Michael Audley was asleep in his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) easy-chair. As my lady softly closed this door Alicia descended the stairs from her (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) own room. The turret door was open, and the sun was shining upon the wet grass-plat in the quadrangle. The firm gravel-walks were already very nearly dry, for the rain had ceased for upward of two hours.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Will you take a walk with me in the quadrangle?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Audley/LADY AUDLEY</b></font>)</div>Lady Audley asked as her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) step-daughter approached. The armed neutrality between the two women admitted of any chance civility such as this.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, if you please, my lady,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alicia/Miss Audley/Miss Alicia</b></font>)</div>Alicia answered, rather listlessly. <div class="bookquote">``I have been yawning over a stupid novel all the morning, and shall be very glad of a little fresh air.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the novelist</b></font>)</div><p/>Heaven help the novelist whose fiction Miss Audley had been perusing, if he (<font color='blue'><b>novelist</b></font>) had no better critics than that young lady. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had read page after page without knowing what she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had been reading, and had flung aside the volume half a dozen times to go to the window and watch for that visitor whom she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had so confidently expected.

<p/>Lady Audley led the way through the low doorway and on to the smooth gravel drive, by which carriages approached the house. She (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) was still very pale, but the brightness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) dress and of her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) feathery golden ringlets, distracted an observer's eyes from her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) pallid face. All mental distress is, with some show of reason, associated in our minds with loose, disordered garments and dishabilled hair, and an appearance in every way the reverse of my lady's. Why had she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) come out into the chill sunshine of that March afternoon to wander up and down that monotonous pathway with the step-daughter she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) hated? She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) came because she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was under the dominion of a horrible restlessness, which, would not suffer her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) to remain within the house waiting for certain tidings which she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) knew must too surely come. At first she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had wished to ward them off--at first she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had wished that strange convulsions of nature might arise to hinder their coming--that abnormal winter lightnings might wither and destroy the messenger who carried them--that the ground might tremble and yawn beneath his (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) hastening feet, and that impassable gulfs might separate the spot from which the tidings were to come and the place to which they were to be carried. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) wished that the earth might stand still, and the paralyzed elements cease from their natural functions, that the progress of time might stop, that the Day of Judgment might come, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) might thus be brought before an unearthly tribunal, and so escape the intervening shame and misery of any earthly judgment. In the wild chaos of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) brain, every one of these thoughts had held its place, and in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) short slumber on the sofa in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) dressing-room she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had dreamed all these things and a hundred other things, all bearing upon the same subject. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had dreamed that a brook, a tiny streamlet when she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) first saw it, flowed across the road between Mount Stanning and Audley, and gradually swelled into a river, and from a river became an ocean, till the village on the hill receded far away out of sight and only a great waste of waters rolled where it once had been. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) dreamt that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) saw the messenger, now one person, now another, but never any probable person, hindered by a hundred hinderances, now startling and terrible, now ridiculous and trivial, but never either natural or probable; and going down into the quiet house with the memory of these dreams strong upon her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had been bewildered by the stillness which had betokened that the tidings had not yet come.

<p/>And now her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) mind underwent a complete change. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) no longer wished to delay the dreaded intelligence. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) wished the agony, whatever it was to be, over and done with, the pain suffered, and the release attained. It seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) as if the intolerable day would never come to an end, as if her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) mad wishes had been granted, and the progress of time had actually stopped.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What a long day it has been!''  (<font color='red'><b>Alicia/Miss Audley/Miss Alicia</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Alicia, as if taking up the burden of my lady's thoughts; <div class="bookquote">``nothing but drizzle and mist and wind! And now that it's too late for anybody to go out, it must needs be fine,''  (<font color='red'><b>lady</b></font>)</div>the young lady added, with an evident sense of injury.

<p/>Lady Audley did not answer. She (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) was looking at the stupid one-handed clock, and waiting for the news which must come sooner or later, which could not surely fail to come very speedily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They have been afraid to come and tell him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) thought; <div class="bookquote">``they have been afraid to break the news to Sir Michael. Who will come to tell it, at last, I wonder? The rector of Mount Stanning, perhaps, or the doctor; some important person at least.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>If she (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) could have gone out into the leafless avenues, or onto the high road beyond them; if she (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) could have gone so far as that hill upon which she (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) had so lately parted with Phoebe, she (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) would have gladly done so. She (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) would rather have suffered anything than that slow suspense, that corroding anxiety, that metaphysical dryrot in which heart and mind seemed to decay under an insufferable torture. She (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) tried to talk, and by a painful effort contrived now and then to utter some commonplace remark. Under any ordinary circumstances her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) companion would have noticed her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) embarrassment, but Miss Audley, happening to be very much absorbed by her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) own vexations, was quite as well inclined to be silent as my lady herself. The monotonous walk up and down the graveled pathway suited Alicia's humor. I think that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) even took a malicious pleasure in the idea that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) was very likely catching cold, and that her (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) Cousin Robert was answerable for her (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) danger. If she (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) could have brought upon herself inflammation of the lungs, or ruptured blood-vessels, by that exposure to the chill March atmosphere, I think she (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) would have felt a gloomy satisfaction in her (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) sufferings.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps Robert might care for me, if I had inflammation of the lungs,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) thought. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) couldn't insult me by calling me a bouncer then. Bouncers don't have inflammation of the lungs.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I believe she (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) drew a picture of herself in the last stage of consumption, propped up by pillows in a great easy-chair, looking out of a window in the afternoon sunshine, with medicine bottles, a bunch of grapes and a Bible upon a table by her (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) side, and with Robert, all contrition and tenderness, summoned to receive her (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) farewell blessing. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) preached a whole chapter to him (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) in that parting benediction, talking a great deal longer than was in keeping with her (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) prostrate state, and very much enjoying her (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) dismal castle in the air. Employed in this sentimental manner, Miss Audley took very little notice of her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) step-mother, and the one hand of the blundering clock had slipped to six by the time Robert had been blessed and dismissed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good gracious me!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) cried, suddenly--<div class="bookquote">``six o'clock, and I'm not dressed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>The half-hour bell rung in a cupola upon the roof while Alicia was speaking.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I must go in, my lady,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Won't you come?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Presently,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Audley/LADY AUDLEY</b></font>)</div>answered Lady Audley. <div class="bookquote">``I'm dressed, you see.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Alicia/Miss Audley/Miss Alicia</b></font>)</div><p/>Alicia ran off, but Sir Michael's wife still lingered in the quadrangle, still waited for those tidings which were so long coming.

<p/>It was nearly dark. The blue mists of evening had slowly risen from the ground. The flat meadows were filled with a gray vapor, and a stranger might have fancied Audley Court a castle on the margin of a sea. Under the archway the shadows of fastcoming night lurked darkly, like traitors waiting for an opportunity to glide stealthily into the quadrangle. Through the archway a patch of cold blue sky glimmered faintly, streaked by one line of lurid crimson, and lighted by the dim glitter of one wintry-looking star. Not a creature was stirring in the quadrangle but the restless woman who paced up and down the straight pathways, listening for a footstep whose coming was to strike terror to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) soul. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) heard it at last!--a footstep in the avenue upon the other side of the archway. But was it the footstep? Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) sense of hearing, made unnaturally acute by excitement, told her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) that it was a man's footstep--told even more, that it was the tread of a gentleman, no slouching, lumbering pedestrian in hobnailed boots, but a gentleman who walked firmly and well.

<p/>Every sound fell like a lump of ice upon my lady's heart. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) could not wait, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) could not contain herself, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) lost all self-control, all power of endurance, all capability of self-restraint, and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) rushed toward the archway.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) paused beneath its shadow, for the stranger was close upon her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) saw him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>), oh, God! she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) saw him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) in that dim evening light. Her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) brain reeled, her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) heart stopped beating. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) uttered no cry of surprise, no exclamation of terror, but staggered backward and clung for support to the ivied buttress of the archway. With her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) slender figure crouched into the angle formed by the buttress and the wall which it supported, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) stood staring at the new-comer.

<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) approached her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) more closely her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) knees sunk under her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) dropped to the ground, not fainting, or in any manner unconscious, but sinking into a crouching attitude, and still crushed into the angle of the wall, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) would have made a tomb for herself in the shadow of that sheltering brickwork.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My lady!''

 (<font color='red'><b>The speaker</b></font>)</div><p/>The speaker was Robert Audley. He (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) whose bedroom door she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had double-locked seventeen hours before at the Castle Inn.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is the matter with you?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) said, in a strange, constrained manner. <div class="bookquote">``Get up, and let me take you indoors.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) assisted her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) to rise, and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) obeyed him (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) very submissively. He (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) took her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) arm in his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) strong hand and led her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) across the quadrangle and into the lamp-lit hall. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) shivered more violently than he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) had ever seen any woman shiver before, but she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) made no attempt at resistance to his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) will.

<p/>CHAPTER XXXIV.

<p/>MY LADY TELLS THE TRUTH.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is there any room in which I can talk to you alone?''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>Robert Audley asked, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) looked dubiously round the hall.

<p/>My lady only bowed her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) head in answer. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) pushed open the door of the library, which had been left ajar. Sir Michael had gone to his (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) dressing-room to prepare for dinner after a day of lazy enjoyment, perfectly legitimate for an invalid. The apartment was quite empty, only lighted by the blaze of the fire, as it had been upon the previous evening.

<p/>Lady Audley entered the room, followed by Robert, who closed the door behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>). The wretched, shivering woman went to the fireplace and knelt down before the blaze, as if any natural warmth, could have power to check that unnatural chill. The young man followed her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), and stood beside her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) upon the hearth, with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) arm resting upon the chimney-piece.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Lady Audley,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said, in a voice whose icy sternness held out no hope of any tenderness or compassion, <div class="bookquote">``I spoke to you last-night very plainly, but you refused to listen to me. To-night I must speak to you still more plainly, and you must no longer refuse to listen to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>My lady, crouching before the fire with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) face hidden in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) hands, uttered a low, sobbing sound which was almost a moan, but made no other answer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There was a fire last night at Mount Stanning, Lady Audley,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>the pitiless voice proceeded; <div class="bookquote">``the Castle Inn, the house in which I slept, was burned to the ground. Do you know how I escaped perishing in that destruction?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I escaped by a most providential circumstance which seems a very simple one. I did not sleep in the room which had been prepared for me. The place seemed wretchedly damp and chilly, the chimney smoked abominably when an attempt was made at lighting a fire, and I persuaded the servant to make me up a bed on the sofa in the small ground-floor sitting-room which I had occupied during the evening.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) paused for a moment, watching the crouching figure. The only change in my lady's attitude was that her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) head had fallen a little lower.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Shall I tell you by whose agency the destruction of the Castle Inn was brought about, my lady?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>There was no answer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Shall I tell you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Still the same obstinate silence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My Lady Audley,''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>cried Robert, suddenly, <div class="bookquote">``you are the incendiary. It was you whose murderous hand kindled those flames. It was you who thought by that thrice-horrible deed to rid yourself of me, your enemy and denouncer. What was it to you that other lives might be sacrificed? If by a second massacre of Saint Bartholomew you could have ridded yourself of me you would have sacrificed an army of victims. The day is past for tenderness and mercy. For you I can no longer know pity or compunction. So far as by sparing your shame I can spare others who must suffer by your shame, I will be merciful, but no further. If there were any secret tribunal before which you might be made to answer for your crimes, I would have little scruple in being your accuser, but I would spare that generous and high-born gentleman upon whose noble name your infamy would be reflected.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) voice softened as he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) made this allusion, and for a moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) broke down, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) recovered himself by an effort and continued:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No life was lost in the fire of last night. I slept lightly, my lady, for my mind was troubled, as it has been for a long time, by the misery which I knew was lowering upon this house. It was I who discovered the breaking out of the fire in time to give the alarm and to save the servant girl and the poor drunken wretch, who was very much burnt in spite of efforts, and who now lies in a precarious state at his (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) mother's cottage. It was from him (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) and from his (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) wife that I learned who had visited the Castle Inn in the dead of the night. The woman was almost distracted when she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) saw me, and from her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) I discovered the particulars of last night. Heaven knows what other secrets of yours she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) may hold, my lady, or how easily they might be extorted from her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) if I wanted her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) aid, which I do not. My path lies very straight before me. I have sworn to bring the murderer of George Talboys to justice, and I will keep my oath. I say that it was by your agency my friend met with his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) death. If I have wondered sometimes, as it was only natural I should, whether I was not the victim of some horrible hallucination, whether such an alternative was not more probable than that a young and lovely woman should be capable of so foul and treacherous a murder, all wonder is past. After last night's deed of horror, there is no crime you could commit, however vast and unnatural, which could make me wonder. Henceforth you must seem to me no longer a woman, a guilty woman with a heart which in its worst wickedness has yet some latent power to suffer and feel; I look upon you henceforth as the demoniac incarnation of some evil principle. But you shall no longer pollute this place by your presence. Unless you will confess what you are and who you are in the presence of the man you have deceived so long, and accept from him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and from me such mercy as we may be inclined to extend to you, I will gather together the witnesses who shall swear to your identity, and at peril of any shame to myself and those I love, I will bring upon you the just and awful punishment of your crime.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The woman rose suddenly and stood before him (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) erect and resolute, with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hair dashed away from her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) face and her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) eyes glittering.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Bring Sir Michael!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) cried; <div class="bookquote">``bring him (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) here, and I will confess anything--everything. What do I care? God knows I have struggled hard enough against you, and fought the battle patiently enough; but you have conquered, Mr. Robert Audley. It is a great triumph, is it not--a wonderful victory? You have used your cool, calculating, frigid, luminous intellect to a noble purpose. You have conquered--a MAD WOMAN!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A mad woman!''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>cried Mr. Audley.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, a mad woman. When you say that I killed George Talboys, you say the truth. When you say that I murdered him (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) treacherously and foully, you lie. I killed him (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) because I AM MAD! because my intellect is a little way upon the wrong side of that narrow boundary-line between sanity and insanity; because, when George Talboys goaded me, as you have goaded me, and reproached me, and threatened me, my mind, never properly balanced, utterly lost its balance, and I was mad! Bring Sir Michael; and bring him (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) quickly. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) is to be told one thing let him (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) be told everything; let him (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) hear the secret of my life!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div><p/>Robert Audley left the room to look for his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) uncle. He (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) went in search of that honored kinsman with God knows how heavy a weight of anguish at his (<font color='blue'><b>kinsman</b></font>) heart, for he (<font color='blue'><b>kinsman</b></font>) knew he (<font color='blue'><b>kinsman</b></font>) was about to shatter the day-dream of his (<font color='blue'><b>kinsman</b></font>) uncle's life; and he (<font color='blue'><b>kinsman</b></font>) knew that our dreams are none the less terrible to lose, because they have never been the realities for which we have mistaken them. But even in the midst of his (<font color='blue'><b>kinsman</b></font>) sorrow for Sir Michael, he (<font color='blue'><b>kinsman</b></font>) could not help wondering at my lady's last words--<div class="bookquote">``the secret of my life.''  (<font color='red'><b>lady</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>kinsman</b></font>) remembered those lines in the letter written by Helen Talboys upon the eve of her (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) flight from Wildernsea, which had so puzzled him (<font color='blue'><b>kinsman</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>kinsman</b></font>) remembered those appealing sentences--<div class="bookquote">``You should forgive me, for you know why I have been so. You know the secret of my life.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>kinsman</b></font>) met Sir Michael in the hall. He (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) made no attempt to prepare the way for the terrible revelation which the baronet was to hear. He (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) only drew him (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) into the fire-lit library, and there for the first time addressed him (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) quietly thus: <div class="bookquote">``Lady Audley has a confession to make to you, sir--a confession which I know will be a most cruel surprise, a most bitter grief. But it is necessary for your present honor, and for your future peace, that you should hear it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) has deceived you, I regret to say, most basely; but it is only right that you should hear from her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) own lips any excuses which she (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) may have to offer for her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) wickedness. May God soften this blow for you!''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>sobbed the young man, suddenly breaking down; <div class="bookquote">``I cannot!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/>Sir Michael lifted his (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) hand as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) would command his (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) nephew to be silent, but that imperious hand dropped feeble and impotent at his (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) side. He (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) stood in the center of the fire-lit room rigid and immovable.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Lucy!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) cried, in a voice whose anguish struck like a blow upon the jarred nerves of those who heard it, as the cry of a wounded animal pains the listener--<div class="bookquote">``Lucy, tell me that this man is a madman! tell me so, my love, or I shall kill him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the listener Lucy</b></font>)</div><p/>There was a sudden fury in his (<font color='blue'><b>listener</b></font>) voice as he (<font color='blue'><b>listener</b></font>) turned upon Robert, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>listener</b></font>) could indeed have felled his (<font color='blue'><b>listener</b></font>) wife's accuser to the earth with the strength of his (<font color='blue'><b>listener</b></font>) uplifted arm.

<p/>But my lady fell upon her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) knees at his (<font color='blue'><b>listener</b></font>) feet, interposing herself between the baronet and his (<font color='blue'><b>listener</b></font>) nephew, who stood leaning on the back of an easy-chair, with his (<font color='blue'><b>listener</b></font>) face hidden by his (<font color='blue'><b>listener</b></font>) hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has told you the truth,''  (<font color='red'><b>lady</b></font>)</div>said my lady, <div class="bookquote">``and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is not mad! I have sent him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) for you that I may confess everything to you. I should be sorry for you if I could, for you have been very, very good to me, much better to me than I ever deserved; but I can't, I can't--I can feel nothing but my own misery. I told you long ago that I was selfish; I am selfish still--more selfish than ever in my misery. Happy, prosperous people may feel for others. I laugh at other people's sufferings; they seem so small compared to my own.''

 (<font color='red'><b>lady</b></font>)</div><p/>When first my lady had fallen on her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) knees, Sir Michael had attempted to raise her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), and had remonstrated with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>); but as she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) spoke he (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) dropped into a chair close to the spot upon which she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) knelt, and with his (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) hands clasped together, and with his (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) head bent to catch every syllable of those horrible words, he (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) listened as if his (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) whole being had been resolved into that one sense of hearing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I must tell you the story of my life, in order to tell you why I have become the miserable wretch who has no better hope than to be allowed to run away and hide in some desolate corner of the earth. I must tell you the story of my life,''  (<font color='red'><b>lady</b></font>)</div>repeated my lady, ``but you need not fear that I shall dwell long upon it. It has not been so pleasant to me that I should wish to remember it. When I was a very little child I remember asking a question which it was natural enough that I should ask, God help me! I asked where my mother was. I had a faint remembrance of a face, like what my own is now, looking at me when I was very little better than a baby; but I had missed the face suddenly, and had never seen it since. They told me that mother was away. I was not happy, for the woman who had charge of me was a disagreeable woman and the place in which we lived was a lonely place, a village upon the Hampshire coast, about seven miles from Portsmouth. My father, who was in the navy, only came now and then to see me; and I was left almost entirely to the charge of this woman, who was irregularly paid, and who vented her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) rage upon me when my father was behindhand in remitting her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) money. So you see that at a very early age I found out what it was to be poor.

<p/>``Perhaps it was more from being discontented with my dreary life than from any wonderful impulse of affection, that I asked very often the same question about my mother. I always received the same answer--she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was away. When I asked where, I was told that that was a secret. When I grew old enough to understand the meaning of the word death, I asked if my mother was dead, and I was told--<div class="bookquote">``No, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was not dead; she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was ill, and she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was away.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>I asked how long she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had been ill, and I was told that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had been so some years, ever since I was a baby.

<p/>``At last the secret came out. I worried my foster-mother with the old question one day when the remittances had fallen very much in arrear, and her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) temper had been unusually tried. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) flew into a passion, and told me that my mother was a mad woman, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was in a madhouse forty miles away. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had scarcely said this when she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) repented, and told me that it was not the truth, and that I was not to believe it, or to say that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had told me such a thing. I discovered afterward that my father had made her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) promise most solemnly never to tell me the secret of my mother's fate.

<p/>``I brooded horribly upon the thought of my mother's madness. It haunted me by day and night. I was always picturing to myself this mad woman pacing up and down some prison cell, in a hideous garment that bound her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) tortured limbs. I had exaggerated ideas of the horror of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) situation. I had no knowledge of the different degrees of madness, and the image that haunted me was that of a distraught and violent creature, who would fall upon me and kill me if I came within her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) reach. This idea grew upon me until I used to awake in the dead of night, screaming aloud in an agony of terror, from a dream in which I had felt my mother's icy grasp upon my throat, and heard her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) ravings in my ear.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``When I was ten years old my father came to pay up the arrears due to my protectress, and to take me to school. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had left me in Hampshire longer than he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had intended, from his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) inability to pay this money; so there again I felt the bitterness of poverty, and ran the risk of growing up an ignorant creature among coarse rustic children, because my father was poor.''

 (<font color='red'><b>lady</b></font>)</div><p/>My lady paused for a moment, but only to take breath, for she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had spoken rapidly, as if eager to tell this hated story, and to have done with it. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was still on her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) knees, but Sir Michael made no effort to raise her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>).

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) sat silent and immovable. What was this story that he (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) was listening to? Whose was it, and to what was it to lead? It could not be his (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) wife's; he (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) had heard her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) simple account of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) youth, and had believed it as he (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) had believed in the Gospel. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had told him (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) a very brief story of an early orphanage, and a long, quiet, colorless youth spent in the conventional seclusion of an English boarding-school.

<p/>``My father came at last, and I told him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) what I had discovered. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was very much affected when I spoke of my mother. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was not what the world generally calls a good man, but I learned afterward that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had loved his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) wife very dearly, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) would have willingly sacrificed his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) life to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), and constituted himself her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) guardian, had he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) not been compelled to earn the daily bread of the mad woman and her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) child by the exercise of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) profession. So here again I beheld what a bitter thing it is to be poor. My mother, who might have been tended by a devoted husband, was given over to the care of hired nurses.

<p/>``Before my father sent me to school at Torquay, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) took me to see my mother. This visit served at least to dispel the idea which had so often terrified me. I saw no raving, straight-waist-coated maniac, guarded by zealous jailers, but a golden-haired, blue-eyed, girlish creature, who seemed as frivolous as a butterfly, and who skipped toward us with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) yellow curls decorated with natural flowers, and saluted us with radiant smiles, and gay, ceaseless chatter.

<p/>``But she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) didn't know us. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) would have spoken in the same manner to any stranger who had entered the gates of the garden about her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) prison-house. Her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) madness was an hereditary disease transmitted to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) from her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) mother, who had died mad. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), my mother, had been, or had appeared sane up to the hour of my birth, but from that hour her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) intellect had decayed, and she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had become what I saw her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>).

<p/>``I went away with the knowledge of this, and with the knowledge that the only inheritance I had to expect from my mother was--insanity!

<p/>``I went away with this knowledge in my mind, and with something more--a secret to keep. I was a child of ten years only, but I felt all the weight of that burden. I was to keep the secret of my mother's madness; for it was a secret that might affect me injuriously in after-life. I was to remember this.

<p/>``I did remember this; and it was, perhaps, this that made me selfish and heartless, for I suppose I am heartless. As I grew older I was told that I was pretty--beautiful--lovely--bewitching. I heard all these things at first indifferently, but by-and-by I listened to them greedily, and began to think that in spite of the secret of my life I might be more successful in the world's great lottery than my companions. I had learnt that which in some indefinite manner or other every school-girl learns sooner or later--I learned that my ultimate fate in life depended upon my marriage, and I concluded that if I was indeed prettier than my schoolfellows, I ought to marry better than any one of them.

<p/>``I left school before I was seventeen years of age, with this thought in my mind, and I went to live at the other extremity of England with my father, who had retired upon his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) half-pay, and had established himself at Wildernsea, with the idea that the place was cheap and select.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The place was indeed select. I had not been there a month before I discovered that even the prettiest girl might wait a long time for a rich husband. I wish to hurry over this part of my life. I dare say I was very despicable. You and your nephew, Sir Michael, have been rich all your lives, and can very well afford to despise me; but I knew how far poverty can affect a life, and I looked forward with a sickening dread to a life so affected. At last the rich suitor, the wandering prince came.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) paused for a moment, and shuddered convulsively. It was impossible to see any of the changes in her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) countenance, for her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) face was obstinately bent toward the floor. Throughout her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) long confession she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) never lifted it; throughout her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) long confession her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) voice was never broken by a tear. What she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had to tell she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) told in a cold, hard tone, very much the tone in which some criminal, dogged and sullen to the last, might have confessed to a jail chaplain.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The wandering prince came,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) repeated; <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) was called George Talboys.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>For the first time since his (<font color='blue'><b>chaplain</b></font>) wife's confession had begun, Sir Michael Audley started. He (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) began to understand it all now. A crowd of unheeded words and forgotten circumstances that had seemed too insignificant for remark or recollection, flashed back upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) as vividly as if they had been the leading incidents of his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) past life.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. George Talboys was a cornet in a dragoon regiment. He (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) was the only son of a rich country gentleman. He (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) fell in love with me, and married me three months after my seventeenth birthday. I think I loved him (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) as much as it was in my power to love anybody; not more than I have loved you, Sir Michael--not so much, for when you married me you elevated me to a position that he (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) could never have given me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The dream was broken. Sir Michael Audley remembered that summer's evening, nearly two years ago, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) had first declared his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) love for Mr. Dawson's governess; he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) remembered the sick, half-shuddering sensation of regret and disappointment that had come over him (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) then, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) felt as if it had in some manner dimly foreshadowed the agony of to-night.

<p/>But I do not believe that even in his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) misery he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) felt that entire and unmitigated surprise, that utter revulsion of feeling that is felt when a good woman wanders away from herself and becomes the lost creature whom her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) husband is bound in honor to abjure. I do not believe that Sir Michael Audley had ever really believed in his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) wife. He (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) had loved her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) and admired her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) had been bewitched by her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) beauty and bewildered by her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) charms; but that sense of something wanting, that vague feeling of loss and disappointment which had come upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) on the summer's night of his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) betrothal had been with him (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) more or less distinctly ever since. I cannot believe that an honest man, however pure and single may be his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mind, however simply trustful his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) nature, is ever really deceived by falsehood. There is beneath the voluntary confidence an involuntary distrust, not to be conquered by any effort of the will.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We were married,''  (<font color='red'><b>lady</b></font>)</div>my lady continued, ``and I loved him (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) very well, quite well enough to be happy with him (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) as long as his (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) money lasted, and while we were on the Continent, traveling in the best style and always staying at the best hotels. But when we came back to Wildernsea and lived with papa, and all the money was gone, and George grew gloomy and wretched, and was always thinking of his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) troubles, and appeared to neglect me, I was very unhappy, and it seemed as if this fine marriage had only given me a twelvemonth's gayety and extravagance after all. I begged George to appeal to his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) father, but he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) refused. I persuaded him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) to try and get employment, and he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) failed. My baby was born, and the crisis which had been fatal to my mother arose for me. I escaped, but I was more irritable perhaps after my recovery, less inclined to fight the hard battle of the world, more disposed to complain of poverty and neglect. I did complain one day, loudly and bitterly; I upbraided George Talboys for his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) cruelty in having allied a helpless girl to poverty and misery, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) flew into a passion with me and ran out of the house. When I awoke the next morning, I found a letter lying on the table by my bed, telling me that he (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) was going to the antipodes to seek his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) fortune, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) would never see me again until he (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) was a rich man.

<p/>``I looked upon this as a desertion, and I resented it bitterly--resented it by hating the man who had left me with no protector but a weak, tipsy father, and with a child to support. I had to work hard for my living, and in every hour of labor--and what labor is more wearisome than the dull slavery of a governess?--I recognized a separate wrong done me by George Talboys. His (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) father was rich, his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) sister was living in luxury and respectability, and I, his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) wife, and the mother of his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) son, was a slave allied to beggary and obscurity. People pitied me, and I hated them for their pity. I did not love the child, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) had been left a burden upon my hands. The hereditary taint that was in my blood had never until this time showed itself by any one sign or token; but at this time I became subject to fits of violence and despair. At this time I think my mind first lost its balance, and for the first time I crossed that invisible line which separates reason from madness. I have seen my father's eyes fixed upon me in horror and alarm. I have known him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) soothe me as only mad people and children are soothed, and I have chafed against his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) petty devices, I have resented even his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) indulgence.

<p/>``At last these fits of desperation resolved themselves into a desperate purpose. I determined to run away from this wretched home which my slavery supported. I determined to desert this father who had more fear of me than love for me. I determined to go to London and lose myself in that great chaos of humanity.

<p/>``I had seen an advertisement in the Times while I was at Wildernsea, and I presented myself to Mrs. Vincent, the advertiser, under a feigned name. She (<font color='blue'><b>Vincent</b></font>) accepted me, waiving all questions as to my antecedents. You know the rest. I came here, and you made me an offer, the acceptance of which would lift me at once into the sphere to which my ambition had pointed ever since I was a school-girl, and heard for the first time that I was pretty.

<p/>``Three years had passed, and I had received no token of my husband's existence; for, I argued, that if he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had returned to England, he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) would have succeeded in finding me under any name and in any place. I knew the energy of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) character well enough to know this.

<p/>``I said <div class="bookquote">``I have a right to think that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) is dead, or that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) wishes me to believe him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) dead, and his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) shadow shall not stand between me and prosperity.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>I said this, and I became your wife, Sir Michael, with every resolution to be as good a wife as it was in my nature to be. The common temptations that assail and shipwreck some women had no terror for me. I would have been your true and pure wife to the end of time, though I had been surrounded by a legion of tempters. The mad folly that the world calls love had never had any part in my madness, and here at least extremes met, and the vice of heartlessness became the virtue of constancy.

<p/>``I was very happy in the first triumph and grandeur of my new position, very grateful to the hand that had lifted me to it. In the sunshine of my own happiness I felt, for the first time in my life, for the miseries of others. I had been poor myself, and I was now rich, and could afford to pity and relieve the poverty of my neighbors. I took pleasure in acts of kindness and benevolence. I found out my father's address and sent him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) large sums of money, anonymously, for I did not wish him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) to discover what had become of me. I availed myself to the full of the privilege your generosity afforded me. I dispensed happiness on every side. I saw myself loved as well as admired, and I think I might have been a good woman for the rest of my life, if fate would have allowed me to be so.

<p/>``I believe that at this time my mind regained its just balance. I had watched myself very closely since leaving Wildernsea; I had held a check upon myself. I had often wondered while sitting in the surgeon's quiet family circle whether any suspicion of that invisible, hereditary taint had ever occurred to Mr. Dawson.

<p/>``Fate would not suffer me to be good. My destiny compelled me to be a wretch. Within a month of my marriage, I read in one of the Essex papers of the return of a certain Mr. Talboys, a fortunate gold-seeker, from Australia. The ship had sailed at the time I read the paragraph. What was to be done?

<p/>``I said just now that I knew the energy of George's character. I knew that the man who had gone to the antipodes and won a fortune for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife would leave no stone unturned in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) efforts to find her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>). It was hopeless to think of hiding myself from him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).

<p/>``Unless he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could be induced to believe that I was dead, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would never cease in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) search for me.

<p/>``My brain was dazed as I thought of my peril. Again the balance trembled, again the invisible boundary was passed, again I was mad.

<p/>``I went down to Southampton and found my father, who was living there with my child. You remember how Mrs. Vincent's name was used as an excuse for this hurried journey, and how it was contrived I should go with no other escort than Phoebe Marks, whom I left at the hotel while I went to my father's house.

<p/>``I confided to my father the whole secret of my peril. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was not very much shocked at what I had done, for poverty had perhaps blunted his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) sense of honor and principle. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was not very much shocked, but he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was frightened, and he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) promised to do all in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) power to assist me in my horrible emergency.

<p/>``He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had received a letter addressed to me at Wildernsea, by George, and forwarded from there to my father. This letter had been written within a few days of the sailing of the Argus, and it announced the probable date of the ship's arrival at Liverpool. This letter gave us, therefore, data upon which to act.

<p/>``We decided at once upon the first step. This was that on the date of the probable arrival of the Argus, or a few days later, an advertisement of my death should be inserted in the Times.

<p/>``But almost immediately after deciding upon this, we saw that there were fearful difficulties in the carrying out of such a simple plan. The date of the death, and the place in which I died, must be announced, as well as the death itself. George would immediately hurry to that place, however distant it might be, however comparatively inaccessible, and the shallow falsehood would be discovered.

<p/>``I knew enough of his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) sanguine temperament, his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) courage and determination, his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) readiness to hope against hope, to know that unless he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) saw the grave in which I was buried, and the register of my death, he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) would never believe that I was lost to him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>).

<p/>``My father was utterly dumfounded and helpless. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) could only shed childish tears of despair and terror. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was of no use to me in this crisis.

<p/>``I was hopeless of any issue out of my difficulties. I began to think that I must trust to the chapter of accidents, and hope that among other obscure corners of the earth, Audley Court might be undreamt of by my husband.

<p/>``I sat with my father, drinking tea with him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) miserable hovel, and playing with the child, who was pleased with my dress and jewels, but quite unconscious that I was anything but a stranger to him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>). I had the boy in my arms, when a woman who attended him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) came to fetch him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) might make him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) more fit to be seen by the lady, as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said.

<p/>``I was anxious to know how the boy was treated, and I detained this woman in conversation with me while my father dozed over the tea-table.

<p/>``She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was a pale-faced, sandy-haired woman of about five-and-forty and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) seemed very glad to get the chance of talking to me as long as I pleased to allow her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) soon left off talking of the boy, however, to tell me of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) own troubles. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was in very great trouble, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) told me. Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) eldest daughter had been obliged to leave her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) situation from ill-health; in fact, the doctor said the girl was in a decline; and it was a hard thing for a poor widow who had seen better days to have a sick daughter to support, as well as a family of young children.

<p/>``I let the woman run on for a long time in this manner, telling me the girl's ailments, and the girl's age, and the girl's doctor's stuff, and piety, and sufferings, and a great deal more. But I neither listened to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) nor heeded her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). I heard her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), but only in a far-away manner, as I heard the traffic in the street, or the ripple of the stream at the bottom of it. What were this woman's troubles to me? I had miseries of my own, and worse miseries than her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) coarse nature could ever have to endure. These sort of people always had sick husbands or sick children, and expected to be helped in their illness by the rich. It was nothing out of the common. I was thinking this, and I was just going to dismiss the woman with a sovereign for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) sick daughter, when an idea flashed upon me with such painful suddenness that it sent the blood surging up to my brain, and set my heart beating, as it only beats when I am mad.

<p/>``I asked the woman her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) name. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was a Mrs. Plowson, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Plowson</b></font>) kept a small general shop, she (<font color='blue'><b>Plowson</b></font>) said, and only ran in now and then to look after Georgey, and to see that the little maid-of-all-work took care of him (<font color='blue'><b>Georgey</b></font>). Her (<font color='blue'><b>Plowson</b></font>) daughter's name was Matilda. I asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Plowson</b></font>) several questions about this girl Matilda, and I ascertained that she (<font color='blue'><b>Plowson</b></font>) was four-and-twenty, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Plowson</b></font>) had always been consumptive, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Plowson</b></font>) was now, as the doctor said, going off in a rapid decline. He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) had declared that she (<font color='blue'><b>Plowson</b></font>) could not last much more than a fortnight.

<p/>``It was in three weeks that the ship that carried George Talboys was expected to anchor in the Mersey.

<p/>``I need not dwell upon this business. I visited the sick girl. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was fair and slender. Her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) description, carelessly given, might tally nearly enough with my own, though she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) bore no shadow of resemblance to me, except in these two particulars. I was received by the girl as a rich lady who wished to do her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) a service. I bought the mother, who was poor and greedy, and who for a gift of money, more money than she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had ever before received, consented to submit to anything I wished. Upon the second day after my introduction to this Mrs. Plowson, my father went over to Ventnor, and hired lodgings for his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) invalid daughter and her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) little boy. Early the next morning he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) carried over the dying girl and Georgey, who had been bribed to call her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``mamma.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) entered the house as Mrs. Talboys; she (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) was attended by a Ventnor medical man as Mrs. Talboys; she (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) died, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) death and burial were registered in that name.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The advertisement was inserted in the Times, and upon the second day after its insertion George Talboys visited Ventnor, and ordered the tombstone which at this hour records the death of his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) wife, Helen Talboys.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Michael/Michael Audley/Audley</b></font>)</div><p/>Sir Michael Audley rose slowly, and with a stiff, constrained action, as if every physical sense had been benumbed by that one sense of misery.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I cannot hear any more,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) said, in a hoarse whisper; <div class="bookquote">``if there is anything more to be told I cannot hear it. Robert, it is you who have brought about this discovery, as I understand. I want to know nothing more. Will you take upon yourself the duty of providing for the safety and comfort of this lady whom I have thought my wife? I need not ask you to remember in all you do, that I have loved her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) very dearly and truly. I cannot say farewell to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>). I will not say it until I can think of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) without bitterness--until I can pity her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), as I now pray that God may pity her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) this night.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Sir Michael walked slowly from the room. He (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) did not trust himself to look at that crouching figure. He (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) did not wish to see the creature whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) had cherished. He (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) went straight to his (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) dressing-room, rung for his (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) valet, and ordered him (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) to pack a portmanteau, and make all necessary arrangements for accompanying his (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) master by the last up-train.

<p/>CHAPTER XXXV.

<p/>THE HUSH THAT SUCCEEDS THE TEMPEST.

<p/>Robert Audley followed his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) uncle into the vestibule after Sir Michael had spoken those few quiet words which sounded the death-knell of his (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) hope and love. Heaven knows how much the young man had feared the coming of this day. It had come; and though there had been no great outburst of despair, no whirlwind of stormy grief, no loud tempest of anguish and tears, Robert took no comforting thought from the unnatural stillness. He (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) knew enough to know that Sir Michael Audley went away with the barbed arrow, which his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) nephew's hand had sent home to its aim, rankling in his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) tortured heart; he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) knew that this strange and icy calm was the first numbness of a heart stricken by grief so unexpected as for a time to be rendered almost incomprehensible by a blank stupor of astonishment; he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) knew that when this dull quiet had passed away, when little by little, and one by one, each horrible feature of the sufferer's sorrow became first dimly apparent and then terribly familiar to him (<font color='blue'><b>sufferer</b></font>), the storm would burst in fatal fury, and tempests of tears and cruel thunder-claps of agony would rend that generous heart.

<p/>Robert had heard of cases in which men of his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) uncle's age had borne some great grief, as Sir Michael had borne this, with a strange quiet; and had gone away from those who would have comforted them, and whose anxieties have been relieved by this patient stillness, to fall down upon the ground and die under the blow which at first had only stunned him (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) remembered cases in which paralysis and apoplexy had stricken men as strong as his (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) uncle in the first hour of the horrible affliction; and he (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) lingered in the lamp-lit vestibule, wondering whether it was not his (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) duty to be with Sir Michael--to be near him (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>), in case of any emergency, and to accompany him (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) wherever he (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) went.

<p/>Yet would it be wise to force himself upon that gray-headed sufferer in this cruel hour, in which he (<font color='blue'><b>sufferer</b></font>) had been awakened from the one delusion of a blameless life to discover that he (<font color='blue'><b>sufferer</b></font>) had been the dupe of a false face, and the fool of a nature which was too coldly mercenary, too cruelly heartless, to be sensible of its own infamy?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>thought Robert Audley, <div class="bookquote">``I will not intrude upon the anguish of this wounded heart. There is humiliation mingled with this bitter grief. It is better he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) should fight the battle alone. I have done what I believe to have been my solemn duty, yet I should scarcely wonder if I had rendered myself forever hateful to him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>). It is better he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) should fight the battle alone. I can do nothing to make the strife less terrible. Better that it should be fought alone.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div><p/>While the young man stood with his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) hand upon the library door, still half-doubtful whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) should follow his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) uncle or re-enter the room in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) had left that more wretched creature whom it had been his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) business to unmask, Alicia Audley opened the dining-room door, and revealed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) the old-fashioned oak-paneled apartment, the long table covered with showy damask, and bright with a cheerful glitter of glass and silver.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is papa coming to dinner?''  (<font color='red'><b>Alicia/Miss Audley/Miss Alicia</b></font>)</div>asked Miss Audley. <div class="bookquote">``I'm so hungry; and poor Tomlins has sent up three times to say the fish will be spoiled. It must be reduced to a species of isinglass soup, by this time, I should think,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>added the young lady, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) came out into the vestibule with the Times newspaper in her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) hand.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) had been sitting by the fire reading the paper, and waiting for her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) seniors to join her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) at the dinner table.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, it's you, Mr. Robert Audley.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) remarked, indifferently. <div class="bookquote">``You dine with us of course. Pray go and find papa. It must be nearly eight o'clock, and we are supposed to dine at six.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Audley answered his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) cousin rather sternly. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) frivolous manner jarred upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) forgot in his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) irrational displeasure that Miss Audley had known nothing of the terrible drama which had been so long enacting under her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) very nose.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your papa has just endured a very great grief, Alicia,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>the young man said, gravely.

<p/>The girl's arch, laughing face changed in a moment to a tenderly earnest look of sorrow and anxiety. Alicia Audley loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) father very dearly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A grief?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) exclaimed; <div class="bookquote">``papa grieved! Oh! Robert, what has happened?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can tell you nothing yet, Alicia,''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>Robert answered in a low voice.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) cousin by the wrist, and drew her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) into the dining-room as he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) spoke. He (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) closed the door carefully behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) before he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) continued:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Alicia, can I trust you?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) asked, earnestly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Trust me to do what?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To be a comfort and a friend to your poor father under a very heavy affliction.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes!''  (<font color='red'><b>Alicia/Miss Audley/Miss Alicia</b></font>)</div>cried Alicia, passionately. <div class="bookquote">``How can you ask me such a question? Do you think there is anything I would not do to lighten any sorrow of my father's? Do you think there is anything I would not suffer if my suffering could lighten his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Alicia/Miss Audley/Miss Alicia</b></font>)</div><p/>The rushing tears rose to Miss Audley's bright gray eyes as she (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) spoke.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Robert! Robert! could you think so badly of me as to think I would not try to be a comfort to my father in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) grief?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) said, reproachfully.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>answered the young man, quietly; <div class="bookquote">``I never doubted your affection, I only doubted your discretion. May I rely upon that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You may, Robert,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alicia/Miss Audley/Miss Alicia</b></font>)</div>said Alicia, resolutely.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well, then, my dear girl, I will trust you. Your father is going to leave the Court, for a time at least. The grief which he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) has just endured--a sudden and unlooked-for sorrow, remember--has no doubt made this place hateful to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) is going away; but he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) must not go alone, must he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), Alicia?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Alone? no! no! But I suppose my lady--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Lady Audley will not go with him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>said Robert, gravely; <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) is about to separate himself from her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``For a time?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, forever.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Separate himself from her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) forever!''  (<font color='red'><b>Alicia/Miss Audley/Miss Alicia</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Alicia. <div class="bookquote">``Then this grief--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is connected with Lady Audley. Lady Audley is the cause of your father's sorrow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Alicia/Miss Audley/Miss Alicia</b></font>)</div><p/>Alicia's face, which had been pale before, flushed crimson. Sorrow, of which my lady was the cause--a sorrow which was to separate Sir Michael forever from his (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) wife! There had been no quarrel between them--there had never been anything but harmony and sunshine between Lady Audley and her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) generous husband. This sorrow must surely then have arisen from some sudden discovery; it was, no doubt, a sorrow associated with disgrace. Robert Audley understood the meaning of that vivid blush.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You will offer to accompany your father wherever he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) may choose to go, Alicia,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``You are his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) natural comforter at such a time as this, but you will best befriend him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) in this hour of trial by avoiding all intrusion upon his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) grief. Your very ignorance of the particulars of that grief will be a security for your discretion. Say nothing to your father that you might not have said to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) two years ago, before he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) married a second wife. Try and be to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) what you were before the woman in yonder room came between you and your father's love.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alicia/Miss Audley/Miss Alicia</b></font>)</div>murmured Alicia, <div class="bookquote">``I will.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Alicia/Miss Audley/Miss Alicia</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You will naturally avoid all mention of Lady Audley's name. If your father is often silent, be patient; if it sometimes seems to you that the shadow of this great sorrow will never pass away from his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) life, be patient still; and remember that there can be no better hope of a cure of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) grief than the hope that his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) daughter's devotion may lead him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) to remember there is one woman upon this earth who will love him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) truly and purely until the last.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes--yes, Robert, dear cousin, I will remember.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Audley, for the first time since he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) had been a schoolboy, took his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) cousin in his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) arms and kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) broad forehead.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear Alicia,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``do this and you will make me happy. I have been in some measure the means of bringing this sorrow upon your father. Let me hope that it is not an enduring one. Try and restore my uncle to happiness, Alicia, and I will love you more dearly than brother ever loved a noble-hearted sister; and a brotherly affection may be worth having, perhaps, after all, my dear, though it is very different to poor Sir Harry's enthusiastic worship.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Alicia's head was bent and her (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) face hidden from her (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) cousin while he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) spoke, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) lifted her (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) head when he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) had finished, and looked him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) full in the face with a smile that was only the brighter for her (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) eyes being filled with tears.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are a good fellow, Bob,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``and I've been very foolish and wicked to feel angry with you because--''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>The young lady stopped suddenly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Because what, my dear?''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>asked Mr. Audley.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Because I'm silly, Cousin Robert,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alicia/Miss Audley/Miss Alicia</b></font>)</div>Alicia said, quickly; <div class="bookquote">``never mind that, Bob, I'll do all you wish, and it shall not be my fault if my dearest father doesn't forget his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) troubles before long. I'd go to the end of the world with him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), poor darling, if I thought there was any comfort to be found for him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) in the journey. I'll go and get ready directly. Do you think papa will go to-night?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Alicia/Miss Audley/Miss Alicia</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, my dear; I don't think Sir Michael will rest another night under this roof yet awhile.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The mail goes at twenty minutes past nine,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alicia/Miss Audley/Miss Alicia</b></font>)</div>said Alicia; <div class="bookquote">``we must leave the house in an hour if we are to travel by it. I shall see you again before we go, Robert?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Alicia/Miss Audley/Miss Alicia</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, dear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Alicia/Miss Audley/Miss Alicia</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Audley ran off to her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) room to summon her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) maid, and make all necessary preparations for the sudden journey, of whose ultimate destination she (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) was as yet quite ignorant.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) went heart and soul into the carrying out of the duty which Robert had dictated to her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) assisted in the packing of her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) portmanteaus, and hopelessly bewildered her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) maid by stuffing silk dresses into her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) bonnet-boxes and satin shoes into her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) dressing-case. She (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) roamed about her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) rooms, gathering together drawing-materials, music-books, needle-work, hair-brushes, jewelry, and perfume-bottles, very much as she (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) might have done had she (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) been about to sail for some savage country, devoid of all civilized resources. She (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) was thinking all the time of her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) father's unknown grief, and perhaps a little of the serious face and earnest voice which had that night revealed her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) Cousin Robert to her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) in a new character.

<p/>Mr. Audley went up-stairs after his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) cousin, and found his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) way to Sir Michael's dressing-room. He (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) knocked at the door and listened, Heaven knows how anxiously, for the expected answer. There was a moment's pause, during which the young man's heart beat loud and fast, and then the door was opened by the baronet himself. Robert saw that his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) uncle's valet was already hard at work preparing for his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) master's hurried journey.

<p/>Sir Michael came out into the corridor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you anything more to say to me, Robert?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) asked, quietly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I only came to ascertain if I could assist in any of your arrangements. You go to London by the mail?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you any idea of where you will stay.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I shall stop at the Clarendon; I am known there. Is that all you have to say?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; except that Alicia will accompany you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Alicia!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) could not very well stay here, you know, just now. It would be best for her (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) to leave the Court until--''

 (<font color='red'><b>the baronet</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, yes, I understand,''  (<font color='red'><b>the baronet</b></font>)</div>interrupted the baronet; <div class="bookquote">``but is there nowhere else that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) could go--must she (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) be with me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the baronet</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) could go nowhere else so immediately, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) would not be happy anywhere else.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Let her (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) come, then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Michael/Michael Audley/Audley</b></font>)</div>said Sir Michael, <div class="bookquote">``let her (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) come.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Michael/Michael Audley/Audley</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) spoke in a strange, subdued voice, and with an apparent effort, as if it were painful to him (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) to have to speak at all; as if all this ordinary business of life were a cruel torture to him (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>), and jarred so much upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) grief as to be almost worse to bear than that grief itself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well, my dear uncle, then all is arranged; Alicia will be ready to start at nine o'clock.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very good, very good,''  (<font color='red'><b>the baronet</b></font>)</div>muttered the baronet; <div class="bookquote">``let her (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) come if she (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) pleases, poor child, let her (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) come.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the baronet</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) sighed heavily as he (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) spoke in that half pitying tone of his (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) daughter. He (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) was thinking how comparatively indifferent he (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) had been toward that only child for the sake of the woman now shut in the fire-lit room below.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall see you again before you go, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>said Robert; <div class="bookquote">``I will leave you till then.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Stay!''  (<font color='red'><b>Michael/Michael Audley/Audley</b></font>)</div>said Sir Michael, suddenly; <div class="bookquote">``have you told Alicia?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Michael/Michael Audley/Audley</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have told her (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) nothing, except that you are about to leave the Court for some time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are very good, my boy, you are very good,''  (<font color='red'><b>the baronet</b></font>)</div>the baronet murmured in a broken voice.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) stretched out his (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) hand. His (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) nephew took it in both his (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) own, and pressed it to his (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) lips.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, sir! how can I ever forgive myself?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``how can I ever cease to hate myself for having brought this grief upon you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no, Robert, you did right; I wish that God had been so merciful to me as to take my miserable life before this night; but you did right.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Michael/Michael Audley/Audley</b></font>)</div><p/>Sir Michael re-entered his (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) dressing-room, and Robert slowly returned to the vestibule. He (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) paused upon the threshold of that chamber in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) had left Lucy--Lady Audley, otherwise Helen Talboys, the wife of his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) lost friend.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) was lying upon the floor, upon the very spot in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) had crouched at her (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) husband's feet telling her (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) guilty story. Whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) was in a swoon, or whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) lay there in the utter helplessness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) misery, Robert scarcely cared to know. He (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) went out into the vestibule, and sent one of the servants to look for her (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) maid, the smart, be-ribboned damsel who was loud in wonder and consternation at the sight of her (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) mistress.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Lady Audley is very ill,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``take her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) to her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) room and see that she (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) does not leave it to-night. You will be good enough to remain near her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>), but do not either talk to her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) or suffer her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) to excite herself by talking.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>My lady had not fainted; she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) allowed the girl to assist her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), and rose from the ground upon which she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had groveled. Her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) golden hair fell in loose, disheveled masses about her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) ivory throat and shoulders, her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) face and lips were colorless, her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) eyes terrible in their unnatural light.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Take me away,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``and let me sleep! Let me sleep, for my brain is on fire!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>As she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was leaving the room with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) maid, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) turned and looked at Robert. <div class="bookquote">``Is Sir Michael gone?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) will leave in half an hour.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There were no lives lost in the fire at Mount Stanning?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``None.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am glad of that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The landlord of the house, Marks, was very terribly burned, and lies in a precarious state at his (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) mother's cottage; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) may recover.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am glad of that--I am glad no life was lost. Good-night, Mr. Audley.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall ask to see you for half an hour's conversation in the course of to-morrow, my lady.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Whenever you please. Good night.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good night.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) went away quietly leaning upon her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) maid's shoulder, and leaving Robert with a sense of strange bewilderment that was very painful to him (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>).

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) sat down by the broad hearth upon which the red embers were fading, and wondered at the change in that old house which, until the day of his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) friend's disappearance, had been so pleasant a home for all who sheltered beneath its hospitable roof. He (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) sat brooding over the desolate hearth, and trying to decide upon what must be done in this sudden crisis. He (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) sat helpless and powerless to determine upon any course of action, lost in a dull revery, from which he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) was aroused by the sound of carriage-wheels driving up to the little turret entrance.

<p/>The clock in the vestibule struck nine as Robert opened the library door. Alicia had just descended the stairs with her (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) maid; a rosy-faced country girl.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good-by, Robert,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alicia/Miss Audley/Miss Alicia</b></font>)</div>said Miss Audley, holding out her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) hand to her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) cousin; <div class="bookquote">``good-by, and God bless you! You may trust me to take care of papa.''

 (<font color='red'><b>cousin</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sure I may. God bless you, my dear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div><p/>For the second time that night Robert Audley pressed his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) lips to his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) cousin's candid forehead, and for the second time the embrace was of a brotherly or paternal character, rather than the rapturous proceeding which it would have been had Sir Harry Towers been the privileged performer.

<p/>It was five minutes past nine when Sir Michael came down-stairs, followed by his (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) valet, grave and gray-haired like himself. The baronet was pale, but calm and self-possessed. The hand which he (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) gave to his (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) nephew was as cold as ice, but it was with a steady voice that he (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) bade the young man good-by.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I leave all in your hands, Robert,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) said, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) turned to leave the house in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) had lived so long. <div class="bookquote">``I may not have heard the end, but I have heard enough. Heaven knows I have no need to hear more. I leave all to you, but you will not be cruel--you will remember how much I loved--''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) voice broke huskily before he (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) could finish the sentence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I will remember you in everything, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>the young man answered. <div class="bookquote">``I will do everything for the best.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>A treacherous mist of tears blinded him (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) and shut out his (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) uncle's face, and in another minute the carriage had driven away, and Robert Audley sat alone in the dark library, where only one red spark glowed among the pale gray ashes. He (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) sat alone, trying to think what he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) ought to do, and with the awful responsibility of a wicked woman's fate upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) shoulders.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good Heaven!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) thought; ``surely this must be God's judgment upon the purposeless, vacillating life I led up to the seventh day of last September. Surely this awful responsibility has been forced upon me in order that I may humble myself to an offended Providence, and confess that a man cannot choose his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own life. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cannot say, ``I will take existence lightly, and keep out of the way of the wretched, mistaken, energetic creatures, who fight so heartily in the great battle.'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) cannot say, ``I will stop in the tents while the strife is fought, and laugh at the fools who are trampled down in the useless struggle.<div class="bookquote">'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) cannot do this. He (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) can only do, humbly and fearfully, that which the Maker who created him (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) has appointed for him (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) to do. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) has a battle to fight, let him (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) fight it faithfully; but woe betide him (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) skulks when his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) name is called in the mighty muster-roll, woe betide him (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) hides in the tents when the tocsin summons him (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) to the scene of war!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the fools</b></font>)</div><p/>One of the servants brought candles into the library and relighted the fire, but Robert Audley did not stir from his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) seat by the hearth. He (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) sat as he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) had often sat in his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) chambers in Figtree Court, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) elbows resting upon the arms of his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) chair, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) chin upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) hand.

<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) lifted his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) head as the servant was about to leave the room.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Can I send a message from here to London?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It can be sent from Brentwood, sir--not from here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Audley looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) watch thoughtfully.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``One of the men can ride over to Brentwood, sir, if you wish any message to be sent.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do wish to send a message; will you manage it for me, Richards?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You can wait, then, while I write the message.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div><p/>The man brought writing materials from one of the side-tables, and placed them before Mr. Audley.

<p/>Robert dipped a pen in the ink, and stared thoughtfully at one of the candles for a few moments before he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) began to write.

<p/>The message ran thus:

<p/>``From Robert Audley, of Audley Court, Essex, to Francis Wilmington, of Paper-buildings, Temple.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``DEAR WILMINGTON--If you know any physician experienced in cases of mania, and to be trusted with a secret, be so good as to send me his (<font color='blue'><b>physician</b></font>) address by telegraph.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Audley sealed this document in a stout envelope, and handed it to the man, with a sovereign.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You will see that this is given to a trustworthy person, Richards,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``and let the man wait at the station for the return message. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ought to get it in an hour and a half.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Richards, who had known Robert Audley in jackets and turn-down collars, departed to execute his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) commission. Heaven forbid that we should follow him (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) into the comfortable servants' hall at the Court, where the household sat round the blazing fire, discussing in utter bewilderment the events of the day.

<p/>Nothing could be wider from the truth than the speculations of these worthy people. What clew had they to the mystery of that firelit room in which a guilty woman had knelt at their master's feet to tell the story of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) sinful life? They only knew that which Sir Michael's valet had told them of this sudden journey. How his (<font color='blue'><b>valet</b></font>) master was as pale as a sheet, and spoke in a strange voice that didn't sound like his (<font color='blue'><b>valet</b></font>) own, somehow, and how you might have knocked him (<font color='blue'><b>valet</b></font>)--Mr. Parsons, the valet--down with a feather, if you had been minded to prostrate him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) by the aid of so feeble a weapon.

<p/>The wiseheads of the servants' hall decided that Sir Michael had received sudden intelligence through Mr. Robert--they were wise enough to connect the young man with the catastrophe--either of the death of some near and dear relation--the elder servants decimated the Audley family in their endeavors to find a likely relation--or of some alarming fall in the funds, or of the failure of some speculation or bank in which the greater part of the baronet's money was invested. The general leaning was toward the failure of a bank, and every member of the assembly seemed to take a dismal and raven-like delight in the fancy, though such a supposition involved their own ruin in the general destruction of that liberal household.

<p/>Robert sat by the dreary hearth, which seemed dreary even now when the blaze of a great wood-fire roared in the wide chimney, and listened to the low wail of the March wind moaning round the house and lifting the shivering ivy from the walls it sheltered. He (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) was tired and worn out, for remember that he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) had been awakened from his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) sleep at two o'clock that morning by the hot breath of blazing timber and the sharp crackling of burning woodwork. But for his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) presence of mind and cool decision, Mr. Luke Marks would have died a dreadful death. He (<font color='blue'><b>Marks</b></font>) still bore the traces of the night's peril, for the dark hair had been singed upon one side of his (<font color='blue'><b>Marks</b></font>) forehead, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Marks</b></font>) left hand was red and inflamed, from the effect of the scorching atmosphere out of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Marks</b></font>) had dragged the landlord of the Castle Inn. He (<font color='blue'><b>Marks</b></font>) was thoroughly exhausted with fatigue and excitement, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Marks</b></font>) fell into a heavy sleep in his (<font color='blue'><b>Marks</b></font>) easy-chair before the bright fire, from which he (<font color='blue'><b>Marks</b></font>) was only awakened by the entrance of Mr. Richards with the return message.

<p/>This return message was very brief.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``DEAR AUDLEY--Always glad to oblige. Alwyn Mosgrave, M.D., 12 Saville Row. Safe.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>This with names and addresses, was all that it contained.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall want another message taken to Brentwood to-morrow morning, Richards,''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Audley, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) folded the telegram. <div class="bookquote">``I should be glad if the man would ride over with it before breakfast. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shall have half a sovereign for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) trouble.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Richards/Mr. Richards</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Richards bowed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you, sir--not necessary, sir; but as you please, of course, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Richards</b></font>) murmured. <div class="bookquote">``At what hour might you wish the man to go?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Audley might wish the man to go as early as he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) could, so it was decided that he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) should go at six.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My room is ready, I suppose, Richards?''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>said Robert.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir--your old room.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very good. I shall go to bed at once. Bring me a glass of brandy and water as hot as you can make it, and wait for the telegram.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Doctor</b></font>)</div><p/>This second message was only a very earnest request to Doctor Mosgrave to pay an immediate visit to Audley Court on a matter of serious moment.

<p/>Having written this message, Mr. Audley felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) had done all that he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) could do. He (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) drank his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) brandy and water. He (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) had actual need of the diluted alcohol, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) had been chilled to the bone by his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) adventures during the fire. He (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) slowly sipped the pale golden liquid and thought of Clara Talboys, of that earnest girl whose brother's memory was now avenged, whose brother's destroyer was humiliated in the dust. Had she (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) heard of the fire at the Castle Inn? How could she (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) have done otherwise than hear of it in such a place as Mount Stanning? But had she (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) heard that he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) had been in danger, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) had distinguished himself by the rescue of a drunken boor? I fear that, even sitting by that desolate hearth, and beneath the roof whose noble was an exile from his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) own house, Robert Audley was weak enough to think of these things--weak enough to let his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) fancy wander away to the dismal fir-trees under the cold March sky, and the dark-brown eyes that were so like the eyes of his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) lost friend.

<p/>CHAPTER XXXVI.

<p/>DR. MOSGRAVE``S ADVICE.

<p/>My lady slept. Through that long winter night she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) slept soundly. Criminals have often so slept their last sleep upon earth; and have been found in the gray morning slumbering peacefully, by the jailer who came to wake them.

<p/>The game had been played and lost. I do not think that my lady had thrown away a card, or missed the making of a trick which she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) might by any possibility have made; but her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) opponent's hand had been too powerful for her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>opponent</b></font>) had won.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) looked upon herself as a species of state prisoner, who would have to be taken good care of. A second Iron Mask, who must be provided for in some comfortable place of confinement. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) abandoned herself to a dull indifference. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had lived a hundred lives within the space of the last few days of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) existence, and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had worn out her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) capacity for suffering--for a time at least.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) ate her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) breakfast, and took her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) morning bath, and emerged, with perfumed hair and in the most exquisitely careless of morning toilets, from her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) luxurious dressing-room. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) looked at herself in the cheval-glass before she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) left the room. A long night's rest had brought back the delicate rose-tints of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) complexion, and the natural luster of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) blue eyes. That unnatural light which had burned so fearfully the day before had gone, and my lady smiled triumphantly as she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) contemplated the reflection of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) beauty. The days were gone in which her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) enemies could have branded her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) with white-hot irons, and burned away the loveliness which had done such mischief. Whatever they did to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) they must leave her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) beauty, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) thought. At the worst, they were powerless to rob her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) of that.

<p/>The March day was bright and sunny, with a cheerless sunshine certainly. My lady wrapped herself in an Indian shawl; a shawl that had cost Sir Michael a hundred guineas. I think she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had an idea that it would be well to wear this costly garment; so that if hustled suddenly away, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) might carry at least one of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) possessions with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>). Remember how much she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had periled for a fine house and gorgeous furniture, for carriages and horses, jewels and laces; and do not wonder if she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) clings with a desperate tenacity to gauds and gew-gaws, in the hour of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) despair. If she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had been Judas, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) would have held to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) thirty pieces of silver to the last moment of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) shameful life.

<p/>Mr. Robert Audley breakfasted in the library. He (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) sat long over his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) solitary cup of tea, smoking his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) meerschaum pipe, and meditating darkly upon the task that lay before him (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I will appeal to the experience of this Dr. Mosgrave,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) though; <div class="bookquote">``physicians and lawyers are the confessors of this prosaic nineteenth century. Surely, he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) will be able to help me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The first fast train from London arrived at Audley at half-past ten o'clock, and at five minutes before eleven, Richards, the grave servant, announced Dr. Alwyn Mosgrave.

<p/>The physician from Saville Row was a tall man of about fifty years of age. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was thin and sallow, with lantern jaws, and eyes of a pale, feeble gray, that seemed as if they had once been blue, and had faded by the progress of time to their present neutral shade. However powerful the science of medicine as wielded by Dr. Alwyn Mosgrave, it had not been strong enough to put flesh upon his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) bones, or brightness into his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had a strangely expressionless, and yet strangely attentive countenance. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had the face of a man who had spent the greater part of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) life in listening to other people, and who had parted with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own individuality and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own passions at the very outset of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) career.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) bowed to Robert Audley, took the opposite seat indicated by him (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>), and addressed his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) attentive face to the young barrister. Robert saw that the physician's glance for a moment lost its quiet look of attention, and became earnest and searching.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) is wondering whether I am the patient,''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>thought Mr. Audley, <div class="bookquote">``and is looking for the diagnoses of madness in my face.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div><p/>Dr. Mosgrave spoke as if in answer to this thought.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it not about your own--health--that you wish to consult me?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) said, interrogatively.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, no!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dr. Mosgrave/Dr. Alwyn Mosgrave/Alwyn Mosgrave</b></font>)</div><p/>Dr. Mosgrave looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) watch, a fifty-guinea Benson-made chronometer, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) carried loose in his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) waistcoat pocket as carelessly as if it had been a potato.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I need not remind you that my time is precious,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``your telegram informed me that my services were required in a case of--danger--as I apprehend, or I should not be here this morning.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Robert Audley had sat looking gloomily at the fire, wondering how he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) should begin the conversation, and had needed this reminder of the physician's presence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are very good, Dr. Mosgrave,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>physician</b></font>) said, rousing himself by an effort, <div class="bookquote">``and I thank you very much for having responded to my summons. I am about to appeal to you upon a subject which is more painful to me than words can describe. I am about to implore your advice in a most difficult case, and I trust almost blindly to your experience to rescue me, and others who are very dear to me, from a cruel and complicated position.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The business-like attention in Dr. Mosgrave's face grew into a look of interest as he (<font color='blue'><b>physician</b></font>) listened to Robert Audley.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The revelation made by the patient to the physician is, I believe, as sacred as the confession of a penitent to his (<font color='blue'><b>physician</b></font>) priest?''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>Robert asked, gravely.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Quite as sacred.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A solemn confidence, to be violated under no circumstances?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Most certainly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div><p/>Robert Audley looked at the fire again. How much should he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) tell, or how little, of the dark history of his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) uncle's second wife?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have been given to understand, Dr. Mosgrave, that you have devoted much of your attention to the treatment of insanity.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, my practice is almost confined to the treatment of mental diseases.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Such being the case, I think I may venture to conclude that you sometimes receive strange, and even terrible, revelations.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dr. Mosgrave/Dr. Alwyn Mosgrave/Alwyn Mosgrave</b></font>)</div><p/>Dr. Mosgrave bowed.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) looked like a man who could have carried, safely locked in his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) passionless breast, the secrets of a nation, and who would have suffered no inconvenience from the weight of such a burden.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The story which I am about to tell you is not my own story,''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>said Robert, after a pause; <div class="bookquote">``you will forgive me, therefore, if I once more remind you that I can only reveal it upon the understanding that under no circumstances, or upon no apparent justification, is that confidence to be betrayed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div><p/>Dr. Mosgrave bowed again. A little sternly, perhaps, this time.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am all attention, Mr. Audley,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) said coldly.

<p/>Robert Audley drew his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) chair nearer to that of the physician, and in a low voice began the story which my lady had told upon her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) knees in that same chamber upon the previous night. Dr. Mosgrave's listening face, turned always toward the speaker, betrayed no surprise at that strange revelation. He (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) smiled once, a grave, quiet smile, when Mr. Audley came to that part of the story which told of the conspiracy at Ventnor; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) was not surprised. Robert Audley ended his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) story at the point at which Sir Michael Audley had interrupted my lady's confession. He (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) told nothing of the disappearance of George Talboys, nor of the horrible suspicions that had grown out of that disappearance. He (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) told nothing of the fire at the Castle Inn.

<p/>Dr. Mosgrave shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) head, gravely, when Mr. Audley came to the end of his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) story.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You have nothing further to tell me?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No. I do not think there is anything more that need be told,''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>Robert answered, rather evasively.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You would wish to prove that this lady is mad, and therefore irresponsible for her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) actions, Mr. Audley?''  (<font color='red'><b>the physician</b></font>)</div>said the physician.

<p/>Robert Audley stared, wondering at the mad doctor. By what process had he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) so rapidly arrived at the young man's secret desire?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I would rather, if possible, think her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) mad; I should be glad to find that excuse for her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And to save the esclandre of a Chancery suit, I suppose, Mr. Audley,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dr. Mosgrave/Dr. Alwyn Mosgrave/Alwyn Mosgrave</b></font>)</div>said Dr. Mosgrave.

<p/>Robert shuddered as he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) bowed an assent to this remark. It was something worse than a Chancery suit that he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) dreaded with a horrible fear. It was a trial for murder that had so long haunted his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) dreams. How often he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) had awoke, in an agony of shame, from a vision of a crowded court-house, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) uncle's wife in a criminal dock, hemmed in on every side by a sea of eager faces.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I fear that I shall not be of any use to you,''  (<font color='red'><b>the physician</b></font>)</div>the physician said, quietly; <div class="bookquote">``I will see the lady, if you please, but I do not believe that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) is mad.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the physician</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why not?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because there is no evidence of madness in anything she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) has done. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) ran away from her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) home, because her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) home was not a pleasant one, and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) left in the hope of finding a better. There is no madness in that. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) committed the crime of bigamy, because by that crime she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) obtained fortune and position. There is no madness there. When she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) found herself in a desperate position, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) did not grow desperate. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) employed intelligent means, and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) carried out a conspiracy which required coolness and deliberation in its execution. There is no madness in that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But the traits of hereditary insanity--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``May descend to the third generation, and appear in the lady's children, if she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) have any. Madness is not necessarily transmitted from mother to daughter. I should be glad to help you, if I could, Mr. Audley, but I do not think there is any proof of insanity in the story you have told me. I do not think any jury in England would accept the plea of insanity in such a case as this. The best thing you can do with this lady is to send her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) back to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) first husband; if he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) will have her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div><p/>Robert started at this sudden mention of his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) friend.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) first husband is dead,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) answered, <div class="bookquote">``at least, he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) has been missing for some time--and I have reason to believe that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) is dead.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Dr. Mosgrave saw the startled movement, and heard the embarrassment in Robert Audley's voice as he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) spoke of George Talboys.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The lady's first husband is missing,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) said, with a strange emphasis on the word--<div class="bookquote">``you think that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) is dead?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) paused for a few moments and looked at the fire, as Robert had looked before.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Audley,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) said, presently, <div class="bookquote">``there must be no half-confidences between us. You have not told me all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Robert, looking up suddenly, plainly expressed in his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) face the surprise he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) felt at these words.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I should be very poorly able to meet the contingencies of my professional experience,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dr. Mosgrave/Dr. Alwyn Mosgrave/Alwyn Mosgrave</b></font>)</div>said Dr. Mosgrave, <div class="bookquote">``if I could not perceive where confidence ends and reservation begins. You have only told me half this lady's story, Mr. Audley. You must tell me more before I can offer you any advice. What has become of the first husband?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dr. Mosgrave/Dr. Alwyn Mosgrave/Alwyn Mosgrave</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) asked this question in a decisive tone, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) knew it to be the key-stone of an arch.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have already told you, Dr. Mosgrave, that I do not know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>the physician</b></font>)</div>answered the physician, <div class="bookquote">``but your face has told me what you have withheld from me; it has told me that you suspect.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the physician</b></font>)</div><p/>Robert Audley was silent.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If I am to be of use to you, you must trust me, Mr. Audley,''  (<font color='red'><b>the physician</b></font>)</div>said the physician. <div class="bookquote">``The first husband disappeared--how and when? I want to know the history of his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) disappearance.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div><p/>Robert paused for some time before he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) replied to this speech; but, by and by, he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) lifted his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) head, which had been bent in an attitude of earnest thought, and addressed the physician.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I will trust you, Dr. Mosgrave,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>physician</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I will confide entirely in your honor and goodness. I do not ask you to do any wrong to society; but I ask you to save our stainless name from degradation and shame, if you can do so conscientiously.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>physician</b></font>) told the story of George's disappearance, and of his (<font color='blue'><b>physician</b></font>) own doubts and fears, Heaven knows how reluctantly.

<p/>Dr. Mosgrave listened as quietly as he (<font color='blue'><b>physician</b></font>) had listened before. Robert concluded with an earnest appeal to the physician's best feelings. He (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) implored him (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) to spare the generous old man whose fatal confidence in a wicked woman had brought much misery upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) declining years.

<p/>It was impossible to draw any conclusion, either favorable or otherwise, from Dr. Mosgrave's attentive face. He (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) rose, when Robert had finished speaking, and looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) watch once more.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can only spare you twenty minutes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I will see the lady, if you please. You say her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) mother died in a madhouse?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) did. Will you see Lady Audley alone?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, alone, if you please.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div><p/>Robert rung for my lady's maid, and under convoy of that smart young damsel the physician found his (<font color='blue'><b>physician</b></font>) way to the octagon antechamber, and the fairy boudoir with which it communicated.

<p/>Ten minutes afterward, he (<font color='blue'><b>physician</b></font>) returned to the library, in which Robert sat waiting for him (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have talked to the lady,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) said, quietly, <div class="bookquote">``and we understand each other very well. There is latent insanity! Insanity which might never appear; or which might appear only once or twice in a lifetime. It would be a dementia in its worst phase, perhaps; acute mania; but its duration would be very brief, and it would only arise under extreme mental pressure. The lady is not mad; but she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) has the hereditary taint in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) blood. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) has the cunning of madness, with the prudence of intelligence. I will tell you what she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) is, Mr. Audley. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) is dangerous!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Dr. Mosgrave walked up and down the room once or twice before he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) spoke again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I will not discuss the probabilities of the suspicion which distresses you, Mr. Audley,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) said, presently, <div class="bookquote">``but I will tell you this much, I do not advise any esclandre. This Mr. George Talboys has disappeared, but you have no evidence of his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) death. If you could produce evidence of his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) death, you could produce no evidence against this lady, beyond the one fact that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had a powerful motive for getting rid of him (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>). No jury in the United Kingdom would condemn her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) upon such evidence as that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Robert Audley interrupted Dr. Mosgrave, hastily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I assure you, my dear sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``that my greatest fear is the necessity of any exposure--any disgrace.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly, Mr. Audley,''  (<font color='red'><b>the physician</b></font>)</div>answered the physician, coolly, <div class="bookquote">``but you cannot expect me to assist you to condone one of the worst offenses against society. If I saw adequate reason for believing that a murder had been committed by this woman, I should refuse to assist you in smuggling her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) away out of the reach of justice, although the honor of a hundred noble families might be saved by my doing so. But I do not see adequate reason for your suspicions; and I will do my best to help you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the physician</b></font>)</div><p/>Robert Audley grasped the physician's hands in both his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) own.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I will thank you when I am better able to do so,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) said, with emotion; <div class="bookquote">``I will thank you in my uncle's name as well as in my own.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have only five minutes more, and I have a letter to write,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dr. Mosgrave/Dr. Alwyn Mosgrave/Alwyn Mosgrave</b></font>)</div>said Dr. Mosgrave, smiling at the young man's energy.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) seated himself at a writing-table in the window, dipped his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) pen in the ink, and wrote rapidly for about seven minutes. He (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) had filled three sides of a sheet of note-paper, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) threw down his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) pen and folded his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) letter.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) put this letter into an envelope, and delivered it, unsealed, to Robert Audley.

<p/>The address which it bore was:

<p/>``Monsieur Val,

<p/>``Villebrumeuse,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Belgium.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Audley looked rather doubtfully from this address to the doctor, who was putting on his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) gloves as deliberately as if his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) life had never known a more solemn purpose than the proper adjustment of them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That letter,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) said, in answer to Robert Audley's inquiring look, <div class="bookquote">``is written to my friend Monsieur Val, the proprietor and medical superintendent of a very excellent maison de santé in the town of Villebrumeuse. We have known each other for many years, and he (<font color='blue'><b>superintendent</b></font>) will no doubt willingly receive Lady Audley into his (<font color='blue'><b>superintendent</b></font>) establishment, and charge himself with the full responsibility of her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) future life; it will not be a very eventful one!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div><p/>Robert Audley would have spoken, he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) would have once more expressed his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) gratitude for the help which had been given to him (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>), but Dr. Mosgrave checked him (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) with an authoritative gesture.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``From the moment in which Lady Audley enters that house,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) life, so far as life is made up of action and variety, will be finished. Whatever secrets she (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) may have will be secrets forever! Whatever crimes she (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) may have committed she (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) will be able to commit no more. If you were to dig a grave for her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) in the nearest churchyard and bury her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) alive in it, you could not more safely shut her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) from the world and all worldly associations. But as a physiologist and as an honest man, I believe you could do no better service to society than by doing this; for physiology is a lie if the woman I saw ten minutes ago is a woman to be trusted at large. If she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) could have sprung at my throat and strangled me with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) little hands, as I sat talking to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) just now, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would have done it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) suspected your purpose, then!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) knew it. ``You think I am mad like my mother, and you have come to question me,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) said. ``You are watching for some sign of the dreadful taint in my blood.<div class="bookquote">'' Good-day to you, Mr. Audley,''  (<font color='red'><b>the physician</b></font>)</div>the physician added hurriedly, <div class="bookquote">``my time was up ten minutes ago; it is as much as I shall do to catch the train.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the physician</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER XXXVII.

<p/>BURIED ALIVE.

<p/>Robert Audley sat alone in the library with the physician's letter upon the table before him (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>), thinking of the work which was still to be done.

<p/>The young barrister had constituted himself the denouncer of this wretched woman. He (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) had been her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) judge; and he (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) was now her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) jailer. Not until he (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) had delivered the letter which lay before him (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) to its proper address, not until he (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) had given up his (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) charge into the safe-keeping of the foreign mad-house doctor, not until then would the dreadful burden be removed from him (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) duty done.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) wrote a few lines to my lady, telling her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) was going to carry her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) away from Audley Court to a place from which she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was not likely to return, and requesting her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) to lose no time in preparing for the journey. He (<font color='blue'><b>Court</b></font>) wished to start that evening, if possible, he (<font color='blue'><b>Court</b></font>) told her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>).

<p/>Miss Susan Martin, the lady's maid, thought it a very hard thing to have to pack her (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) mistress' trunks in such a hurry, but my lady assisted in the task. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) toiled resolutely in directing and assisting her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) servant, who scented bankruptcy and ruin in all this packing up and hurrying away, and was therefore rather languid and indifferent in the discharge of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) duties; and at six o'clock in the evening she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) sent her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) attendant to tell Mr. Audley that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was ready to depart as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) pleased.

<p/>Robert had consulted a volume of Bradshaw, and had discovered that Villebrumeuse lay out of the track of all railway traffic, and was only approachable by diligence from Brussels. The mail for Dover left London Bridge at nine o'clock, and could be easily caught by Robert and his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) charge, as the seven o'clock up-train from Audley reached Shoreditch at a quarter past eight. Traveling by the Dover and Calais route, they would reach Villebrumeuse by the following afternoon or evening.

<p/>It was late in the afternoon of the next day when the diligence bumped and rattled over the uneven paving of the principal street in Villebrumeuse.

<p/>Robert Audley and my lady had had the coupé of the diligence to themselves for the whole of the journey, for there were not many travelers between Brussels and Villebrumeuse, and the public conveyance was supported by the force of tradition rather than any great profit attaching to it as a speculation.

<p/>My lady had not spoken during the journey, except to decline some refreshments which Robert had offered her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) at a halting place upon the road. Her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) heart sunk when they left Brussels behind, for she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had hoped that city might have been the end of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) journey, and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had turned with a feeling of sickness and despair from the dull Belgian landscape.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) looked up at last as the vehicle jolted into a great stony quadrangle, which had been the approach to a monastery once, but which was now the court yard of a dismal hotel, in whose cellars legions of rats skirmished and squeaked even while the broad sunshine was bright in the chambers above.

<p/>Lady Audley shuddered as she (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) alighted from the diligence, and found herself in that dreary court yard. Robert was surrounded by chattering porters, who clamored for his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``baggages,''  (<font color='red'><b>porters</b></font>)</div>and disputed among themselves as to the hotel at which he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) was to rest. One of these men ran away to fetch a hackney-coach at Mr. Audley's behest, and reappeared presently, urging on a pair of horses--which were so small as to suggest the idea that they had been made out of one ordinary-sized animal--with wild shrieks and whoops that had a demoniac sound in the darkness.

<p/>Mr. Audley left my lady in a dreary coffee-room in the care of a drowsy attendant while he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) drove away to some distant part of the quiet city. There was official business to be gone through before Sir Michael's wife could be quietly put away in the place suggested by Dr. Mosgrave. Robert had to see all manner of important personages; and to take numerous oaths; and to exhibit the English physician's letter; and to go through much ceremony of signing and countersigning before he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) could take his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) lost friend's cruel wife to the home which was to be her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) last upon earth. Upward of two hours elapsed before all this was arranged, and the young man was free to return to the hotel, where he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) found his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) charge staring absently at a pair of wax-candles, with a cup of untasted coffee standing cold and stagnant before her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>).

<p/>Robert handed my lady into the hired vehicle, and took his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) seat opposite to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) once more.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where are you going to take me?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) asked, at last. <div class="bookquote">``I am tired of being treated like some naughty child, who is put into a dark cellar as a punishment for its offenses. Where are you taking me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To a place in which you will have ample leisure to repent the past, Mrs. Talboys,''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>Robert answered, gravely.

<p/>They had left the paved streets behind them, and had emerged out of a great gaunt square, in which there appeared to be about half a dozen cathedrals, into a small boulevard, a broad lamp-lit road, on which the shadows of the leafless branches went and came tremblingly, like the shadows of a paralytic skeleton. There were houses here and there upon this boulevard; stately houses, entre cour et jardin, and with plaster vases of geraniums on the stone pillars of the ponderous gateways. The rumbling hackney-carriage drove upward of three-quarters of a mile along this smooth roadway before it drew up against a gateway, older and more ponderous than any of those they had passed.

<p/>My lady gave a little scream as she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) looked out of the coach-window. The gaunt gateway was lighted by an enormous lamp; a great structure of iron and glass, in which one poor little shivering flame struggled with the March wind.

<p/>The coachman rang the bell, and a little wooden door at the side of the gate was opened by a gray-haired man, who looked out at the carriage, and then retired. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) reappeared three minutes afterward behind the folding iron gates, which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) unlocked and threw back to their full extent, revealing a dreary desert of stone-paved courtyard.

<p/>The coachman led his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wretched horses into the courtyard, and piloted the vehicle to the principal doorway of the house, a great mansion of gray stone, with several long ranges of windows, many of which were dimly lighted, and looked out like the pale eyes of weary watchers upon the darkness of the night.

<p/>My lady, watchful and quiet as the cold stars in the wintry sky, looked up at these casements with an earnest and scrutinizing gaze. One of the windows was shrouded by a scanty curtain of faded red; and upon this curtain there went and came a dark shadow, the shadow of a woman with a fantastic head dress, the shadow of a restless creature, who paced perpetually backward and forward before the window.

<p/>Sir Michael Audley's wicked wife laid her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) hand suddenly upon Robert's arm, and pointed with the other hand to this curtained window.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I know where you have brought me,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``This is a MAD-HOUSE.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Audley did not answer her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) had been standing at the door of the coach when she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) addressed him (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) quietly assisted her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) to alight, and led her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) up a couple of shallow stone steps, and into the entrance-hall of the mansion. He (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) handed Dr. Mosgrave's letter to a neatly-dressed, cheerful-looking, middle-aged woman, who came tripping out of a little chamber which opened out of the hall, and was very much like the bureau of an hotel. This person smilingly welcome Robert and his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) charge: and after dispatching a servant with the letter, invited them into her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) pleasant little apartment, which was gayly furnished with bright amber curtains and heated by a tiny stove.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Madam finds herself very much fatigued?''  (<font color='red'><b>the Frenchwoman</b></font>)</div>the Frenchwoman said, interrogatively, with a look of intense sympathy, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Frenchwoman</b></font>) placed an arm-chair for my lady.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Madam''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>shrugged her (<font color='blue'><b>Frenchwoman</b></font>) shoulders wearily, and looked round the little chamber with a sharp glance of scrutiny that betokened no very great favor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``WHAT is this place, Robert Audley?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Frenchwoman</b></font>) cried fiercely. <div class="bookquote">``Do you think I am a baby, that you may juggle with and deceive me--what is it? It is what I said just now, is it not?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is a maison de santé, my lady,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>the young man answered, gravely. <div class="bookquote">``I have no wish to juggle with or to deceive you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>lady</b></font>)</div><p/>My lady paused for a few moments, looking reflectively at Robert.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A maison de santé,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) repeated. <div class="bookquote">``Yes, they manage these things better in France. In England we should call it a madhouse. This a house for mad people, this, is it not, madam?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said in French, turning upon the woman, and tapping the polished floor with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) foot.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, but no, madam,''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>the woman answered with a shrill scream of protest. <div class="bookquote">``It is an establishment of the most agreeable, where one amuses one's self--''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was interrupted by the entrance of the principal of this agreeable establishment, who came beaming into the room with a radiant smile illuminating his (<font color='blue'><b>principal</b></font>) countenance, and with Dr. Mosgrave's letter open in his (<font color='blue'><b>principal</b></font>) hand.

<p/>It was impossible to say how enchanted he (<font color='blue'><b>principal</b></font>) was to make the acquaintance of M'sieu. There was nothing upon earth which he (<font color='blue'><b>principal</b></font>) was not ready to do for M'sieu in his (<font color='blue'><b>principal</b></font>) own person, and nothing under heaven which he (<font color='blue'><b>principal</b></font>) would not strive to accomplish for him (<font color='blue'><b>principal</b></font>), as the friend of his (<font color='blue'><b>principal</b></font>) acquaintance, so very much distinguished, the English doctor. Dr. Mosgrave's letter had given him (<font color='blue'><b>principal</b></font>) a brief synopsis of the case, he (<font color='blue'><b>principal</b></font>) informed Robert, in an undertone, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) was quite prepared to undertake the care of the charming and very interesting <div class="bookquote">``Madam--Madam--''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) rubbed his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) hands politely, and looked at Robert. Mr. Audley remembered, for the first time, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) had been recommended to introduce his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) wretched charge under a feigned name.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) affected not to hear the proprietor's question. It might seem a very easy matter to have hit upon a heap of names, any one of which would have answered his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) purpose; but Mr. Audley appeared suddenly to have forgotten that he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) had ever heard any mortal appellation except that of himself and of his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) lost friend.

<p/>Perhaps the proprietor perceived and understood his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) embarrassment. He (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) at any rate relieved it by turning to the woman who had received them, and muttering something about No. 14, Bis. The woman took a key from a long range of others, that hung over the mantel-piece, and a wax candle from a bracket in a corner of the room, and having lighted the candle, led the way across the stone-paved hall, and up a broad, slippery staircase of polished wood.

<p/>The English physician had informed his (<font color='blue'><b>physician</b></font>) Belgian colleague that money would be of minor consequence in any arrangements made for the comfort of the English lady who was to be committed to his (<font color='blue'><b>physician</b></font>) care. Acting upon this hint, Monsieur Val opened the outer door of a stately suite of apartments, which included a lobby, paved with alternate diamonds of black and white marble, but of a dismal and cellar-like darkness; a saloon furnished with gloomy velvet draperies, and with a certain funereal splendor which is not peculiarly conducive to the elevation of the spirits; and a bed-chamber, containing a bed so wondrously made, as to appear to have no opening whatever in its coverings, unless the counterpane had been split asunder with a pen-knife.

<p/>My lady stared dismally round at the range of rooms, which looked dreary enough in the wan light of a single wax-candle. This solitary flame, pale and ghost-like in itself, was multiplied by paler phantoms of its ghostliness, which glimmered everywhere about the rooms; in the shadowy depths of the polished floors and wainscot, or the window-panes, in the looking-glasses, or in those great expanses of glimmering something which adorned the rooms, and which my lady mistook for costly mirrors, but which were in reality wretched mockeries of burnished tin.

<p/>Amid all the faded splendor of shabby velvet, and tarnished gilding, and polished wood, the woman dropped into an arm-chair, and covered her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) face with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hands. The whiteness of them, and the starry light of diamonds trembling about them, glittered in the dimly-lighted chamber. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) sat silent, motionless, despairing, sullen, and angry, while Robert and the French doctor retired to an outer chamber, and talked together in undertones. Mr. Audley had very little to say that had not been already said for him (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>), with a far better grace than he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) himself could have expressed it, by the English physician. He (<font color='blue'><b>physician</b></font>) had, after great trouble of mind, hit upon the name of Taylor, as a safe and simple substitute for that other name, to which alone my lady had a right. He (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) told the Frenchman that this Mrs. Taylor was distantly related to him (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>)--that she (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) had inherited the seeds of madness from her (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) mother, as indeed Dr. Mosgrave had informed Monsieur Val; and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) had shown some fearful tokens of the lurking taint that was latent in her (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) mind; but that she (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) was not to be called <div class="bookquote">``mad.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) begged that she (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) might be treated with all tenderness and compassion; that she (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) might receive all reasonable indulgences; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) impressed upon Monsieur Val, that under no circumstances was she (<font color='blue'><b>Val</b></font>) to be permitted to leave the house and grounds without the protection of some reliable person, who should be answerable for her (<font color='blue'><b>Val</b></font>) safe-keeping. He (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) had only one other point to urge, and that was, that Monsieur Val, who, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) had understood, was himself a Protestant--the doctor bowed--would make arrangements with some kind and benevolent Protestant clergyman, through whom spiritual advice and consolation might be secured for the invalid lady; who had especial need, Robert added, gravely, of such advantages.

<p/>This--with all necessary arrangements as to pecuniary matters, which were to be settled from time to time between Mr. Audley and the doctor, unassisted by any agents whatever--was the extent of the conversation between the two men, and occupied about a quarter of an hour.

<p/>My lady sat in the same attitude when they re-entered the bedchamber in which they had left her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) ringed hands still clasped over her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) face.

<p/>Robert bent over to whisper in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) ear.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your name is Madam Taylor here,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I do not think you would wish to be known by your real name.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) only shook her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) head in answer to him (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>), and did not even remove her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) hands from over her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Madam will have an attendant entirely devoted to her (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) service.''  (<font color='red'><b>Monsieur Val/Monsieur</b></font>)</div>said Monsieur Val. <div class="bookquote">``Madam will have all her (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) wishes obeyed; her (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) reasonable wishes, but that goes without saying,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>monsieur adds, with a quaint shrug. <div class="bookquote">``Every effort will be made to render madam's sojourn at Villebrumeuse agreeable. The inmates dine together when it is wished. I dine with the inmates sometimes; my subordinate, a clever and a worthy man always. I reside with my wife and children in a little pavilion in the grounds; my subordinate resides in the establishment. Madam may rely upon our utmost efforts being exerted to insure her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) comfort.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Monsieur Val/Monsieur</b></font>)</div><p/>Monsieur is saying a great deal more to the same effect, rubbing his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) hands and beaming radiantly upon Robert and his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) charge, when madam rises suddenly, erect and furious, and dropping her (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>) jeweled fingers from before her (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>) face, tells him (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) to hold his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) tongue.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Leave me alone with the man who has brought me here.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>) cried, between her (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>) set teeth. <div class="bookquote">``Leave me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>) points to the door with a sharp, imperious gesture; so rapid that the silken drapery about her (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>) arm makes a swooping sound as she (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>) lifts her (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>) hand. The sibilant French syllables hiss through her (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>) teeth as she (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>) utters them, and seem better fitted to her (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>) mood and to herself than the familiar English she (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>) has spoken hitherto.

<p/>The French doctor shrugs his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) shoulders as he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) goes out into the lobby, and mutters something about a <div class="bookquote">``beautiful devil,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and a gesture worthy of <div class="bookquote">``the Mars.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>My lady walked with a rapid footstep to the door between the bed-chamber and the saloon; closed it, and with the handle of the door still in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) hand, turned and looked at Robert Audley.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You have brought me to my grave, Mr. Audley,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) cried; <div class="bookquote">``you have used your power basely and cruelly, and have brought me to a living grave.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have done that which I thought just to others and merciful to you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>Robert answered, quietly. <div class="bookquote">``I should have been a traitor to society had I suffered you to remain at liberty after--the disappearance of George Talboys and the fire at Castle Inn. I have brought you to a place in which you will be kindly treated by people who have no knowledge of your story--no power to taunt or to reproach you. You will lead a quiet and peaceful life, my lady; such a life as many a good and holy woman in this Catholic country freely takes upon herself, and happily endures until the end. The solitude of your existence in this place will be no greater than that of a king's daughter, who, flying from the evil of the time, was glad to take shelter in a house as tranquil as this. Surely, it is a small atonement which I ask you to render for your sins, a light penance which I call upon you to perform. Live here and repent; nobody will assail you, nobody will torment you. I only say to you, repent!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I cannot!''  (<font color='red'><b>lady</b></font>)</div>cried my lady, pushing her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) hair fiercely from her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) white forehead, and fixing her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) dilated eyes upon Robert Audley, <div class="bookquote">``I cannot! Has my beauty brought me to this? Have I plotted and schemed to shield myself and laid awake in the long deadly nights, trembling to think of my dangers, for this? I had better have given up at once, since this was to be the end. I had better have yielded to the curse that was upon me, and given up when George Talboys first came back to England.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) plucked at the feathery golden curls as if she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) would have torn them from her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) head. It had served her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) so little after all, that gloriously glittering hair, that beautiful nimbus of yellow light that had contrasted so exquisitely with the melting azure of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) eyes. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) hated herself and her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) beauty.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I would laugh at you and defy you, if I dared,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) cried; <div class="bookquote">``I would kill myself and defy you, if I dared. But I am a poor, pitiful coward, and have been so from the first. Afraid of my mother's horrible inheritance; afraid of poverty; afraid of George Talboys; afraid of you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was silent for a little while, but she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) held her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) place by the door, as if determined to detain Robert as long as it was her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) pleasure to do so.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you know what I am thinking of?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said, presently. <div class="bookquote">``Do you know what I am thinking of, as I look at you in the dim light of this room? I am thinking of the day upon which George Talboys disappeared.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div><p/>Robert started as she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) mentioned the name of his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) lost friend; his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) face turned pale in the dusky light, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) breathing grew quicker and louder.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) was standing opposite me, as you are standing now,''  (<font color='red'><b>lady</b></font>)</div>continued my lady. <div class="bookquote">``You said that you would raze the old house to the ground; that you would root up every tree in the gardens to find your dead friend. You would have had no need to do so much: the body of George Talboys lies at the bottom of the old well, in the shrubbery beyond the lime-walk.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div><p/>Robert Audley flung his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) hands and clasped them above his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) head, with one loud cry of horror.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, my God!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) said, after a dreadful pause; <div class="bookquote">``have all the ghastly things that I have thought prepared me so little for the ghastly truth, that it should come upon me like this at last?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) came to me in the lime-walk,''  (<font color='red'><b>lady</b></font>)</div>resumed my lady, in the same hard, dogged tone as that in which she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had confessed the wicked story of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) life. <div class="bookquote">``I knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) would come, and I had prepared myself, as well as I could, to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>). I was determined to bribe him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), to cajole him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), to defy him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>); to do anything sooner than abandon the wealth and the position I had won, and go back to my old life. He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) came, and he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) reproached me for the conspiracy at Ventnor. He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) declared that so long as he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) lived he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) would never forgive me for the lie that had broken his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) heart. He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) told me that I had plucked his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) heart out of his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) breast and trampled upon it; and that he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had now no heart in which to feel one sentiment of mercy for me. That he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) would have forgiven me any wrong upon earth, but that one deliberate and passionless wrong that I had done him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) said this and a great deal more, and he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) told me that no power on earth should turn him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) from his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) purpose, which was to take me to the man I had deceived, and make me tell my wicked story. He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) did not know the hidden taint that I had sucked in with my mother's milk. He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) did not know that it was possible to drive me mad. He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) goaded me as you have goaded me; he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was as merciless as you have been merciless. We were in the shrubbery at the end of the lime-walk. I was seated upon the broken masonry at the mouth of the well. George Talboys was leaning upon the disused windlass, in which the rusty iron spindle rattled loosely whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) shifted his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) position. I rose at last, and turned upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) to defy him (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>), as I had determined to defy him (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) at the worst. I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) denounced me to Sir Michael, I would declare him (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) to be a madman or a liar, and I defied him (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) to convince the man who loved me--blindly, as I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>)--that he (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) had any claim to me. I was going to leave him (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) after having told him (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) this, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) caught me by the wrist and detained me by force. You saw the bruises that his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) fingers made upon my wrist, and noticed them, and did not believe the account I gave of them. I could see that, Mr. Robert Audley, and I saw that you were a person I should have to fear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) paused, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had expected Robert to speak; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) stood silent and motionless, waiting for the end.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``George Talboys treated me as you treated me,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said, petulantly. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) swore that if there was but one witness of my identity, and that witness was removed from Audley Court by the width of the whole earth, he (<font color='blue'><b>Court</b></font>) would bring him (<font color='blue'><b>Court</b></font>) there to swear to my identity, and to denounce me. It was then that I was mad, it was then that I drew the loose iron spindle from the shrunken wood, and saw my first husband sink with one horrible cry into the black mouth of the well. There is a legend of its enormous depth. I do not know how deep it is. It is dry, I suppose, for I heard no splash, only a dull thud. I looked down and I saw nothing but black emptiness. I knelt down and listened, but the cry was not repeated, though I waited for nearly a quarter of an hour--God knows how long it seemed to me!--by the mouth of the well.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div><p/>Robert Audley uttered a word of horror when the story was finished. He (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) moved a little nearer toward the door against which Helen Talboys stood. Had there been any other means of exit from the room, he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) would gladly have availed himself of it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) shrank from even a momentary contact with this creature.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let me pass you, if you please,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) said, in an icy voice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You see I do not fear to make my confession to you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Helen Talboys/Helen/HELEN TALBOYS</b></font>)</div>said Helen Talboys; <div class="bookquote">``for two reasons. The first is, that you dare not use it against me, because you know it would kill your uncle to see me in a criminal dock; the second is, that the law could pronounce no worse sentence than this--a life-long imprisonment in a mad-house. You see I do not thank you for your mercy, Mr. Robert Audley, for I know exactly what it is worth.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Helen Talboys/Helen/HELEN TALBOYS</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) moved away from the door, and Robert passed her (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) without a word, without a look.

<p/>Half an hour afterward he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) was in one of the principal hotels at Villebrumeuse, sitting at a neatly-ordered supper-table, with no power to eat; with no power to distract his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) mind, even for a moment, from the image of that lost friend who had been treacherously murdered in the thicket at Audley Court.

<p/>CHAPTER XXXVIII.

<p/>GHOST-HAUNTED.

<p/>No feverish sleeper traveling in a strange dream ever looked out more wonderingly upon a world that seemed unreal than Robert Audley, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) stared absently at the flat swamps and dismal poplars between Villebrumeuse and Brussels. Could it be that he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) was returning to his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) uncle's house without the woman who had reigned in it for nearly two years as queen and mistress? He (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) felt as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) had carried off my lady, and had made away with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) secretly and darkly, and must now render up an account to Sir Michael of the fate of that woman, whom the baronet had so dearly loved.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What shall I tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) thought. <div class="bookquote">``Shall I tell the truth--the horrible, ghastly truth? No; that would be too cruel. His (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) generous spirit would sink under the hideous revelation. Yet, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) ignorance of the extent of this wretched woman's wickedness, he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) may think, perhaps, that I have been hard with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div><p/>Brooding thus, Mr. Robert Audley absently watched the cheerless landscape from the seat in the shabby coupé of the diligence, and thought how great a leaf had been torn out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) life, now that the dark story of George Talboys was finished.

<p/>What had he (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) to do next? A crowd of horrible thoughts rushed into his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) mind as he (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) remembered the story that he (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) had heard from the white lips of Helen Talboys. His (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) friend--his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) murdered friend--lay hidden among the moldering ruins of the old well at Audley Court. He (<font color='blue'><b>Court</b></font>) had lain there for six long months, unburied, unknown; hidden in the darkness of the old convent well. What was to be done?

<p/>To institute a search for the remains of the murdered man was to inevitably bring about a coroner's inquest. Should such an inquest be held, it was next to impossible that the history of my lady's crime could fail to be brought to light. To prove that George Talboys met with his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) death at Audley Court, was to prove almost as surely that my lady had been the instrument of that mysterious death; for the young man had been known to follow her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) into the lime-walk upon the day of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) disappearance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My God!''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>Robert exclaimed, as the full horror of his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) position became evident to him (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``is my friend to rest in this unhallowed burial-place because I have condoned the offenses of the woman who murdered him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) felt that there was no way out of this difficulty. Sometimes he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) thought that it little mattered to his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) dead friend whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) lay entombed beneath a marble monument, whose workmanship should be the wonder of the universe, or in that obscure hiding-place in the thicket at Audley Court. At another time he (<font color='blue'><b>Court</b></font>) would be seized with a sudden horror at the wrong that had been done to the murdered man, and would fain have traveled even more rapidly than the express between Brussels and Paris could carry him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eagerness to reach the end of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) journey, that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) might set right this cruel wrong.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was in London at dusk on the second day after that on which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had left Audley Court, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Court</b></font>) drove straight to the Clarendon, to inquire after his (<font color='blue'><b>Court</b></font>) uncle. He (<font color='blue'><b>Court</b></font>) had no intention of seeing Sir Michael, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Court</b></font>) had not yet determined how much or how little he (<font color='blue'><b>Court</b></font>) should tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Court</b></font>), but he (<font color='blue'><b>Court</b></font>) was very anxious to ascertain how the old man had sustained the cruel shock he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had so lately endured.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I will see Alicia,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thought, <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) will tell me all about her (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) father. It is only two days since he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) left Audley. I can scarcely expect to hear of any favorable change.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>But Mr. Audley was not destined to see his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) cousin that evening, for the servants at the Clarendon told him (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) that Sir Michael and his (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) daughter had left by the morning mail for Paris, on their way to Vienna.

<p/>Robert was very well pleased to receive this intelligence; it afforded him (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) a welcome respite, for it would be decidedly better to tell the baronet nothing of his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) guilty wife until he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) returned to England, with health unimpaired and spirits re-established, it was to be hoped.

<p/>Mr. Audley drove to the Temple. The chambers which had seemed dreary to him (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) ever since the disappearance of George Talboys, were doubly so to-night. For that which had been only a dark suspicion had now become a horrible certainty. There was no longer room for the palest ray, the most transitory glimmer of hope. His (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) worst terrors had been too well founded.

<p/>George Talboys had been cruelly and treacherously murdered by the wife he (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) had loved and mourned.

<p/>There were three letters waiting for Mr. Audley at his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) chambers. One was from Sir Michael, and another from Alicia. The third was addressed in a hand the young barrister knew only too well, though he (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) had seen it but once before. His (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) face flushed redly at the sight of the superscription, and he (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) took the letter in his (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) hand, carefully and tenderly, as if it had been a living thing, and sentient to his (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) touch. He (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) turned it over and over in his (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) hands, looking at the crest upon the envelope, at the post-mark, at the color of the paper, and then put it into the bosom of his (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) waistcoat with a strange smile upon his (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What a wretched and unconscionable fool I am!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) thought. <div class="bookquote">``Have I laughed at the follies of weak men all my life, and am I to be more foolish than the weakest of them at last? The beautiful brown-eyed creature! Why did I ever see her (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>)? Why did my relentless Nemesis ever point the way to that dreary house in Dorsetshire?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) opened the first two letters. He (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) was foolish enough to keep the last for a delicious morsel--a fairy-like dessert after the commonplace substantialities of a dinner.

<p/>Alicia's letter told him (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) that Sir Michael had borne his (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) agony with such a persevering tranquility that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) had become at last far more alarmed by his (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) patient calmness than by any stormy manifestation of despair. In this difficulty she (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) had secretly called upon the physician who attended the Audley household in any cases of serious illness, and had requested this gentleman to pay Sir Michael an apparently accidental visit. He (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) had done so, and after stopping half an hour with the baronet, had told Alicia that there was no present danger of any serious consequence from this great grief, but that it was necessary that every effort should be made to arouse Sir Michael, and to force him (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>), however unwillingly, into action.

<p/>Alicia had immediately acted upon this advice, had resumed her (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) old empire as a spoiled child, and reminded her (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) father of a promise he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had made of taking her (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) through Germany. With considerable difficulty she (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) had induced him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) to consent to fulfilling this old promise, and having once gained her (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) point, she (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) had contrived that they should leave England as soon as it was possible to do so, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) told Robert, in conclusion, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) would not bring her (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) father back to his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) old house until she (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) had taught him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) to forget the sorrows associated with it.

<p/>The baronet's letter was very brief. It contained half a dozen blank checks on Sir Michael Audley's London bankers.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You will require money, my dear Robert,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) wrote, <div class="bookquote">``for such arrangements as you may think fit to make for the future comfort of the person I committed to your care. I need scarcely tell you that those arrangements cannot be too liberal. But perhaps it is as well that I should tell you now, for the first and only time, that it is my earnest wish never again to hear that person's name. I have no wish to be told the nature of the arrangements you may make for her (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>). I am sure that you will act conscientiously and mercifully. I seek to know no more. Whenever you want money, you will draw upon me for any sums that you may require; but you will have no occasion to tell me for whose use you want that money.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Robert Audley breathed a long sigh of relief as he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) folded this letter. It released him (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) from a duty which it would have been most painful for him (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) to perform, and it forever decided his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) course of action with regard to the murdered man.

<p/>George Talboys must lie at peace in his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) unknown grave, and Sir Michael Audley must never learn that the woman he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) had loved bore the red brand of murder on her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) soul.

<p/>Robert had only the third letter to open--the letter which he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) had placed in his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) bosom while he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) read the others; he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) tore open the envelope, handling it carefully and tenderly as he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) had done before.

<p/>The letter was as brief as Sir Michael's. It contained only these few lines:

<p/>``DEAR MR. AUDLEY--The rector of this place has been twice to see Marks, the man you saved in the fire at the Castle Inn. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lies in a very precarious state at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mother's cottage, near Audley Court, and is not expected to live many days. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife is attending him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and both he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) have expressed a most earnest desire that you should see him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) before he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) dies. Pray come without delay.

<p/>``Yours very sincerely,

<p/>``CLARA TALBOYS.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mount Stanning Rectory, March 6.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div><p/>Robert Audley folded this letter very reverently, and placed it underneath that part of his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) waistcoat which might be supposed to cover the region of his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) heart. Having done this, he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) seated himself in his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) favorite arm-chair, filled and lighted a pipe and smoked it out, staring reflectingly at the fire as long as his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) tobacco lasted. <div class="bookquote">``What can that man Marks want with me,''  (<font color='red'><b>the barrister</b></font>)</div>thought the barrister. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is afraid to die until he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has made confession, perhaps. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wishes to tell me that which I know already--the story of my lady's crime. I knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was in the secret. I was sure of it even upon the night on which I first saw him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knew the secret, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) traded on it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div><p/>Robert Audley shrank strangely from returning to Essex. How should he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) meet Clara Talboys now that he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) knew the secret of her (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) brother's fate? How many lies he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) should have to tell, or how much equivocation he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) must use in order to keep the truth from her (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>)? Yet would there be any mercy in telling that horrible story, the knowledge of which must cast a blight upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) youth, and blot out every hope she (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) had even secretly cherished? He (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) knew by his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) own experience how possible it was to hope against hope, and to hope unconsciously; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) could not bear that her (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) heart should be crushed as his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) had been by the knowledge of the truth. <div class="bookquote">``Better that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) should hope vainly to the last,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) thought; ``better that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) should go through life seeking the clew to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) lost brother's fate, than that I should give that clew into her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) hands, and say, <div class="bookquote">``Our worst fears are realized. The brother you loved has been foully murdered in the early promise of his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) youth.'''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>But Clara Talboys had written to him (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>), imploring him (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) to return to Essex without delay. Could he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) refuse to do her (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) bidding, however painful its accomplishment might be? And again, the man was dying, perhaps, and had implored to see him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). Would it not be cruel to refuse to go--to delay an hour unnecessarily? He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) watch. It wanted only five minutes to nine. There was no train to Audley after the Ipswich mail, which left London at half-past eight; but there was a train that left Shoreditch at eleven, and stopped at Brentwood between twelve and one. Robert decided upon going by this train, and walking the distance between Brentwood and Audley, which was upwards of six miles.

<p/>Fleet street was quiet and lonely at this late hour, and Robert Audley being in a ghost-seeing mood, would have been scarcely astonished had he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) seen Johnson's set come roystering westward in the lamp-light, or blind John Milton groping his (<font color='blue'><b>Milton</b></font>) way down the steps before Saint Bride's Church.

<p/>Mr. Audley hailed a hansom at the corner of Farrington street, and was rattled rapidly away across tenantless Smithfield market, and into a labyrinth of dingy streets that brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) out upon the broad grandeur of Finsbury Pavement.

<p/>The hansom rattled up the steep and stony approach to Shoreditch Station, and deposited Robert at the doors of that unlovely temple. There were very few people going to travel by this midnight train, and Robert walked up and down the long wooden platform, reading the huge advertisements whose gaunt lettering looked wan and ghastly in the dim lamplight.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) had the carriage in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) sat all to himself. All to himself did I say? Had he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) not lately summoned to his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) side that ghostly company which of all companionship is the most tenacious? The shadow of George Talboys pursued him (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>), even in the comfortable first-class carriage, and was behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) looked out of the window, and was yet far ahead of him (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) and the rushing engine, in that thicket toward which the train was speeding, by the side of the unhallowed hiding-place in which the mortal remains of the dead man lay, neglected and uncared for.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I must give my lost friend decent burial,''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>Robert thought, as the chill wind swept across the flat landscape, and struck him (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) with such frozen breath as might have emanated from the lips of the dead. <div class="bookquote">``I must do it; or I shall die of some panic like this which has seized upon me to-night. I must do it; at any peril; at any cost. Even at the price of that revelation which will bring the mad woman back from her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) safe hiding-place, and place her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) in a criminal dock.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) was glad when the train stopped at Brentwood at a few minutes after twelve.

<p/>It was half-past one o'clock when the night wanderer entered the village of Audley, and it was only there that he (<font color='blue'><b>wanderer</b></font>) remembered that Clara Talboys had omitted to give him (<font color='blue'><b>wanderer</b></font>) any direction by which he (<font color='blue'><b>wanderer</b></font>) might find the cottage in which Luke Marks lay.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It was Dawson who recommended that the poor creature should be taken to his (<font color='blue'><b>Dawson</b></font>) mother's cottage,''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>Robert thought, by-and-by, <div class="bookquote">``and, I dare say. Dawson has attended him (<font color='blue'><b>Dawson</b></font>) ever since the fire. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dawson</b></font>)'ll be able to tell me the way to the cottage.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div><p/>Acting upon this idea, Mr. Audley stopped at the house in which Helen Talboys had lived before her (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) second marriage. The door of the little surgery was ajar, and there was a light burning within. Robert pushed the door open and peeped in. The surgeon was standing at the mahogany counter, mixing a draught in a glass measure, with his (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) hat close beside him (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>). Late as it was, he (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) had evidently only just come in. The harmonious snoring of his (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) assistant sounded from a little room within the surgery.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sorry to disturb you, Mr. Dawson,''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>Robert said, apologetically, as the surgeon looked up and recognized him (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``but I have come down to see Marks, who, I hear, is in a very bad way, and I want you to tell me the way to his (<font color='blue'><b>Dawson</b></font>) mother's cottage.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll show you the way, Mr. Audley,''  (<font color='red'><b>the surgeon</b></font>)</div>answered the surgeon, <div class="bookquote">``I am going there this minute.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the surgeon</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The man is very bad, then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So bad that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) can be no worse. The change that can happen is that change which will take him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) beyond the reach of any earthly suffering.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Strange!''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Robert. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did not appear to be much burned.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was not much burnt. Had he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) been, I should never have recommended his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) being removed from Mount Stanning. It is the shock that has done the business. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has been in a raging fever for the last two days; but to-night he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is much calmer, and I'm afraid, before to-morrow night, we shall have seen the last of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has asked to see me, I am told,''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Audley.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>the surgeon</b></font>)</div>answered the surgeon, carelessly. <div class="bookquote">``A sick man's fancy, no doubt. You dragged him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) out of the house, and did your best to save his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) life. I dare say, rough and boorish as the poor fellow is, he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) thinks a good deal of that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Dawson/Dawson</b></font>)</div><p/>They had left the surgery, the door of which Mr. Dawson had locked behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Dawson</b></font>). There was money in the till, perhaps, for surely the village apothecary could not have feared that the most daring housebreaker would imperil his (<font color='blue'><b>Dawson</b></font>) liberty in the pursuit of blue pill and colocynth, of salts and senna.

<p/>The surgeon led the way along the silent street, and presently turned into a lane at the end of which Robert Audley saw the wan glimmer of a light; a light which told of the watch that is kept by the sick and dying; a pale, melancholy light, which always has a dismal aspect when looked upon in this silent hour betwixt night and morning. It shone from the window of the cottage in which Luke Marks lay, watched by his (<font color='blue'><b>Marks</b></font>) wife and mother.

<p/>Mr. Dawson lifted the latch, and walked into the common room of the little tenement, followed by Robert Audley. It was empty, but a feeble tallow candle, with a broken back, and a long, cauliflower-headed wick, sputtered upon the table. The sick man lay in the room above.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Shall I tell him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) you are here?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Dawson/Dawson</b></font>)</div>asked Mr. Dawson.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, yes, if you please. But be cautious how you tell him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>), if you think the news likely to agitate him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>). I am in no hurry. I can wait. You can call me when you think I can safely come up-stairs.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The surgeon</b></font>)</div><p/>The surgeon nodded, and softly ascended the narrow wooden stairs leading to the upper chamber.

<p/>Robert Audley seated himself in a Windsor chair by the cold hearth-stone, and stared disconsolately about him (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>). But he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) was relieved at last by the low voice of the surgeon, who looked down from the top of the little staircase to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) that Luke Marks was awake, and would be glad to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Marks</b></font>).

<p/>Robert immediately obeyed this summons. He (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) crept softly up the stairs, and took off his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) hat before he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) bent his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) head to enter at the low doorway of the humble rustic chamber. He (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) took off his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) hat in the presence of this common peasant man, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) knew that there was another and a more awful presence hovering about the room, and eager to be admitted.

<p/>Phoebe Marks was sitting at the foot of the bed, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Marks</b></font>) eyes fixed upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Marks</b></font>) husband's face--not with any very tender expression in the pale light, but with a sharp, terrified anxiety, which showed that it was the coming of death itself that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marks</b></font>) dreaded, rather than the loss of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marks</b></font>) husband. The old woman was busy at the fire-place, airing linen, and preparing some mess of broth which it was not likely the patient would ever eat. The sick man lay with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head propped up by pillows, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) coarse face deadly pale, and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) great hands wandering uneasily about the coverlet. Phoebe had been reading to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), for an open Testament lay among the medicine and lotion bottles upon the table near the bed. Every object in the room was neat and orderly, and bore witness of that delicate precision which had always been a distinguishing characteristic of Phoebe.

<p/>The young woman rose as Robert Audley crossed the threshold, and hurried toward him (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let me speak to you for a moment, sir, before you talk to Luke,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said, in an eager whisper. <div class="bookquote">``Pray let me speak to you first.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What's the gal a-sayin', there?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>asked the invalid in a subdued roar, which died away hoarsely on his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) lips. He (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) was feebly savage, even in his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) weakness. The dull glaze of death was gathering over his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) eyes, but they still watched Phoebe with a sharp glance of dissatisfaction. <div class="bookquote">``What's she (<font color='blue'><b>gal</b></font>) up to there?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I won't have no plottin' and no hatchin' agen me. I want to speak to Mr. Audley my own self; and whatever I done I'm goin' to answer for. If I done any mischief, I'm a-goin' to try and undo it. What's she (<font color='blue'><b>gal</b></font>) a-sayin'?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>gal</b></font>) ain't a-sayin' nothin', lovey,''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>answered the old woman, going to the bedside of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) son, who even when made more interesting than usual by illness, did not seem a very fit subject for this tender appellation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>gal</b></font>)'s only a-tellin' the gentleman how bad you've been, my pretty.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What I'm a-goin' to tell I'm only a-goin' to tell to him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>), remember,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>growled Mr. Mark; <div class="bookquote">``and ketch me a-tellin' of it to him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) if it warn't for what he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) done for me the other night.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Mark</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To be sure not, lovey,''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>answered the old woman soothingly.

<p/>Phoebe Marks had drawn Mr. Audley out of the room and onto the narrow landing at the top of the little staircase. This landing was a platform of about three feet square, and it was as much as the two could manage to stand upon it without pushing each other against the whitewashed wall, or backward down the stairs.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, sir, I wanted to speak to you so badly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Phoebe/Phoebe Marks/PHOEBE</b></font>)</div>Phoebe answered, eagerly; <div class="bookquote">``you know what I told you when I found you safe and well upon the night of the fire?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Phoebe/Phoebe Marks/PHOEBE</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I told you what I suspected; what I think still.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I remember.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I never breathed a word of it to anybody but you, sir, and I think that Luke has forgotten all about that night; I think that what went before the fire has gone clean out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) head altogether. He (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) was tipsy, you know, when my la--when she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) came to the Castle; and I think he (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) was so dazed and scared like by the fire that it all went out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) memory. He (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) doesn't suspect what I suspect, at any rate, or he (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>)'d have spoken of it to anybody or everybody; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>)'s dreadful spiteful against my lady, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) says if she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)'d have let him (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) have a place at Brentwood or Chelmsford, this wouldn't have happened. So what I wanted to beg of you, sir, is not to let a word drop before Luke.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, yes, I understand; I will be careful.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My lady has left the Court, I hear, sir?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never to come back, sir?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never to come back.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) has not gone where she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)'ll be cruelly treated; where she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)'ll be ill-used?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No: she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) will be very kindly treated.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm glad of that, sir; I beg your pardon for troubling you with the question, sir, but my lady was a kind mistress to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Luke/Luke Marks/Mr. Marks</b></font>)</div><p/>Luke's voice, husky and feeble, was heard within the little chamber at this period of the conversation, demanding angrily when <div class="bookquote">``that gal would have done jawing;''  (<font color='red'><b>Luke/Luke Marks/Mr. Marks</b></font>)</div>upon which Phoebe put her (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) finger to her (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) lips, and led Mr. Audley back into the sick-room.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't want you''  (<font color='red'><b>Luke/Luke Marks/Mr. Marks</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Marks, decisively, as his (<font color='blue'><b>Marks</b></font>) wife re-entered the chamber--<div class="bookquote">``I don't want you; you've no call to hear what I've got to say--I only want Mr. Audley, and I wants to speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) all alone, with none o' your sneakin' listenin' at doors, d'ye hear? so you may go down-stairs and keep there till you're wanted; and you may take mother--no, mother may stay, I shall want her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) presently.''

 (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div><p/>The sick man's feeble hand pointed to the door, through which his (<font color='blue'><b>Marks</b></font>) wife departed very submissively.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've no wish to hear anything, Luke,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``but I hope you won't say anything against those that have been good and generous to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall say what I like,''  (<font color='red'><b>Luke/Luke Marks/Mr. Marks</b></font>)</div>answered Mr. Marks, fiercely, <div class="bookquote">``and I'm not a-goin' to be ordered by you. You ain't the parson, as I've ever heerd of; nor the lawyer neither.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Luke/Luke Marks/Mr. Marks</b></font>)</div><p/>The landlord of the Castle Inn had undergone no moral transformation by his (<font color='blue'><b>Marks</b></font>) death-bed sufferings, fierce and rapid as they had been. Perhaps some faint glimmer of a light that had been far off from his (<font color='blue'><b>Marks</b></font>) life now struggled feebly through the black obscurities of ignorance that darkened his (<font color='blue'><b>Marks</b></font>) soul. Perhaps a half angry, half sullen penitence urged him (<font color='blue'><b>Marks</b></font>) to make some rugged effort to atone for a life that had been selfish and drunken and wicked. Be it how it might he (<font color='blue'><b>Marks</b></font>) wiped his (<font color='blue'><b>Marks</b></font>) white lips, and turning his (<font color='blue'><b>Marks</b></font>) haggard eyes earnestly upon Robert Audley, pointed to a chair by the bedside.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You made game of me in a general way, Mr. Audley,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) said, presently, ``and you've drawed me out, and you've tumbled and tossed me about like in a gentlemanly way, till I was nothink or anythink in your hands; and you've looked me through and through, and turned me inside out till you thought you knowed as much as I knowed. I'd no particular call to be grateful to you, not before the fire at the Castle t`other night. But I am grateful to you for that. I'm not grateful to folks in a general way, p`r`aps, because the things as gentlefolks have give have a`most allus been the very things I didn't want. They've give me soup, and tracks, and flannel, and coals; but, Lord, they've made such a precious noise about it that I'd have been to send 'em all back to 'em. But when a gentleman goes and puts his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) own life in danger to save a drunken brute like me, the drunkenest brute as ever was feels grateful like to that gentleman, and wishes to say before he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) dies--which he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) sees in the doctor's face as he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) ain't got long to live--<div class="bookquote">``Thank ye, sir, I'm obliged to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Luke/Luke Marks/Mr. Marks</b></font>)</div><p/>Luke Marks stretched out his (<font color='blue'><b>Marks</b></font>) left hand--the right hand had been injured by the fire, and was wrapped in linen--and groped feebly for that of Mr. Robert Audley.

<p/>The young man took the coarse but shrunken hand in both his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own, and pressed it cordially.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I need no thanks, Luke Marks,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``I was very glad to be of service to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Marks did not speak immediately. He (<font color='blue'><b>Marks</b></font>) was lying quietly upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Marks</b></font>) side, staring reflectingly at Robert Audley.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You was oncommon fond of that gent as disappeared at the Court, warn't you, sir?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) said at last.

<p/>Robert started at the mention of his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) dead friend.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You was oncommon fond of that Mr. Talboys, I've heard say, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Luke/Luke Marks/Mr. Marks</b></font>)</div>repeated Luke.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>answered Robert, rather impatiently, <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) was my very dear friend.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div><p/>``I've heard the servants at the Court say how you took on when you couldn't find him (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>). I've heered the landlord of the Sun Inn say how cut up you was when you first missed him (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>). ``If the two gents had been brothers,<div class="bookquote">'' the landlord said, `our gent,''  (<font color='red'><b>gents brothers</b></font>)</div>meanin' you, sir, `couldn't have been more cut up when he (<font color='blue'><b>gent</b></font>) missed the other.'''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, yes, I know, I know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>said Robert; <div class="bookquote">``pray do not speak any more of this subject. I cannot tell you how much it distresses me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div><p/>Was he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) to be haunted forever by the ghost of his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) unburied friend? He (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) came here to comfort the sick man, and even here he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) was pursued by this relentless shadow; even here he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) was reminded of the secret crime which had darkened his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) life.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Listen to me, Marks,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) said, earnestly; <div class="bookquote">``believe me that I appreciate your grateful words, and that I am very glad to have been of service to you. But before you say anything more, let me make one most solemn request. If you have sent for me that you may tell me anything of the fate of my lost friend, I entreat you to spare yourself and to spare me that horrible story. You can tell me nothing which I do not already know. The worst you can tell me of the woman who was once in your power, has already been revealed to me by her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) own lips. Pray, then, be silent upon this subject; I say again, you can tell me nothing which I do not know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Luke Marks looked musingly at the earnest face of his (<font color='blue'><b>Marks</b></font>) visitor, and some shadowy expression, which was almost like a smile, flitted feebly across the sick man's haggard features.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't tell you nothin' you don't know?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then it ain't no good for me to try,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the invalid, thoughtfully. <div class="bookquote">``Did she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) tell you?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) asked, after a pause.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I must beg, Marks, that you will drop the subject,''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>Robert answered, almost sternly. <div class="bookquote">``I have already told you that I do not wish to hear it spoken of. Whatever discoveries you made, you made your market out of them. Whatever guilty secrets you got possession of, you were paid for keeping silence. You had better keep silence to the end.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Had I?''  (<font color='red'><b>Luke/Luke Marks/Mr. Marks</b></font>)</div>cried Luke Marks, in an eager whisper. <div class="bookquote">``Had I really now better hold my tongue to the last?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think so, most decidedly. You traded on your secret, and you were paid to keep it. It would be more honest to hold to your bargain, and keep it still.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Would it now?''  (<font color='red'><b>Luke/Luke Marks/Mr. Marks</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Marks with a ghastly grin; <div class="bookquote">``but suppose my lady had one secret and I another. How then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Luke/Luke Marks/Mr. Marks</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you mean?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Suppose I could have told something all along; and would have told it, perhaps, if I'd been a little better treated; if what was give to me had been give a little more liberal like, and not flung at me as if I was a dog, and was only give it to be kep' from bitin'. Suppose I could have told somethin', and would have told it but for that? How then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/>It was impossible to describe the ghastliness of the triumphant grin that lighted up the sick man's haggard face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``His (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) mind is wandering,''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>Robert thought; <div class="bookquote">``I had need be patient with him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), poor fellow. It would be strange if I could not be patient with a dying man.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div><p/>Luke marks lay staring at Mr. Audley for some moments with that triumphant grin upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) face. The old woman, wearied out with watching her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) dying son, had dropped into a doze, and sat nodding her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) sharp chin over the handful of fire, upon which the broth that was never to be eaten, still bubbled and simmered.

<p/>Mr. Audley waited very patiently until it should be the sick man's pleasure to speak. Every sound was painfully distinct in that dead hour of the night. The dropping of the ashes on the hearth, the ominous crackling of the burning coals, the slow and ponderous ticking of the sulky clock in the room below, the low moaning of the March wind -LRB-which might have been the voice of an English Banshee, screaming her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) dismal warning to the watchers of the dying-RRB-, the hoarse breathing of the sick man--every sound held itself apart from all other sounds, and made itself into a separate voice, loud with a gloomy portent in the solemn stillness of the house.

<p/>Robert sat with his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) face shaded by his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) hands, thinking what was to become of him (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) now that the secret of his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) friend's fate had been told, and the dark story of George Talboys and his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) wicked wife had been finished in the Belgian mad-house. What was to become of him (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>)?

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) had no claim upon Clara Talboys; for he (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) had resolved to keep the horrible secret that had been told to him (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>). How then could he (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) dare to meet her (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) with that secret held back fom her (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>)? How could he (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) ever look into her (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) earnest eyes, and yet withhold the truth? He (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) felt that all power of reservation would fail before the searching glance of those calm brown eyes. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) was indeed to keep this secret he (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) must never see her (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) again. To reveal it would be to embitter her (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) life. Could he (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>), for any selfish motive of his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) own, tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) this terrible story?--or could he (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) think that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) told her (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) would suffer her (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) murdered brother to lie unavenged and forgotten in his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) unhallowed grave?

<p/>Hemmed in on every side by difficulties which seemed utterly insumountable; with the easy temperament which was natural to him (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) embittered by the gloomy burden he (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) had borne so long, Robert Audley looked hopelessly forward to the life which lay before him (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>), and thought that it would have been better for him (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) had he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) perished among the burning ruins of the Castle Inn.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who would have been sorry for me? No one but my poor little Alicia,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) thought, <div class="bookquote">``and hers would have only been an April sorrow. Would Clara Talboys have been sorry? No! She (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) would have only regretted me as a lost link in the mystery of her (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) brother's death. She (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) would only--''

<p/>THAT WHICH THE DYING MAN HAD TO TELL.

<p/>Heaven knows whither Mr. Audley's thoughts might have wandered had he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) not been startled by a sudden movement of the sick man, who raised himself up in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) bed, and called to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mother.

<p/>The old woman woke up with a jerk, and turned sleepily enough to look at her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) son.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is it, Luke, deary?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) asked soothingly. <div class="bookquote">``It ain't time for the doctor's stuff yet. Mr. Dawson said as you weren't to have it till two hours after he (<font color='blue'><b>Dawson</b></font>) went away, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Dawson</b></font>) ain't been gone an hour yet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who said it was the doctor's stuff I wanted?''  (<font color='red'><b>Luke/Luke Marks/Mr. Marks</b></font>)</div>cried Mr. Marks, impatiently. <div class="bookquote">``I want to ask you something, mother. Do you remember the seventh of last September?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div><p/>Robert started, and looked eagerly at the sick man. Why did he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) harp upon this forbidden subject? Why did he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) insist upon recalling the date of George's murder? The old woman shook her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) head in feeble confusion of mind.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Lord, Luke,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``how can`ee ask me such questions? My memory's been a failin' me this eight or nine year; and I never was one to remember the days of the month, or aught o' that sort. How should a poor workin' woman remember such things.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Luke Marks shrugged his (<font color='blue'><b>Marks</b></font>) shoulders impatiently.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You're a good un to do what's asked you, mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Marks</b></font>) said, peevishly. <div class="bookquote">``Didn't I tell you to rememer that day? Didn't I tell you as the time might come when you'd be called upon to bear witness about it, and put upon your Bible oath about it? Didn't I tell you that, mother?''

 (<font color='red'><b>The woman</b></font>)</div><p/>The old woman shook her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) head hopelessly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you say so, I make no doubt you did, Luke,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said, with a conciliatory smile; <div class="bookquote">``but I can't call it to mind, lovey. My memory's been failin' me this nine yaer, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) added, turning to Robert Audley, <div class="bookquote">``and I'm but a poor crittur.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Audley laid his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) hand upon the sick man's arm.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Marks,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I tell you again, you have no cause to worry yourself about this matter. I ask you no questions, I have no wish to hear anything.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But, suppose I want to tell something,''  (<font color='red'><b>Luke/Luke Marks/Mr. Marks</b></font>)</div>cried Luke, with feverish energy, <div class="bookquote">``suppose I feel I can't die with a secret on my mind, and have asked to see you on purpose that I might tell you; suppose that, and you'll suppose nothing but the truth. I'd have been burnt alive before I'd have told her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>Luke/Luke Marks/Mr. Marks</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) spoke these words between his (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) set teeth, and scowled savagely as he (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) uttered them. <div class="bookquote">``I'd have been burnt alive first. I made her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) pay for her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) pretty insolent ways; I made her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) pay for her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) airs and graces; I'd never have told her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)--never, never! I had my power over her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), and I kept it; I had my secret and was paid for it; and there wasn't a petty slight as she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) ever put upon me or mine that I didn't pay her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) out for twenty times over!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Marks, Marks, for Heaven's sake be calm,''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>said Robert, earnestly. <div class="bookquote">``What are you talking of? What is it that you could have told?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm a-goin to tell you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Luke/Luke Marks/Mr. Marks</b></font>)</div>answered Luke, wiping his (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) lips. <div class="bookquote">``Give us a drink, mother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The woman</b></font>)</div><p/>The old woman poured out some cooling drink into a mug, and carried it to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) son.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) drank it in an eager hurry, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) felt that the brief remainder of his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) life must be a race with the pitiless pedestrian, Time.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Stop where you are,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) said to his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) mother, pointing to a chair at the foot of the bed.

<p/>The old woman obeyed, and seated herself meekly opposite to Mr. Audley.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll ask you another question, mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>Luke/Luke Marks/Mr. Marks</b></font>)</div>said Luke, <div class="bookquote">``and I think it'll be strange if you can't answer it. Do you remember when I was at work upon Atkinson's farm; before I was married you know, and when I was livin' down here along of you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Luke/Luke Marks/Mr. Marks</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Marks</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Marks answered, nodding triumphantly, <div class="bookquote">``I remember that, my dear. It were last fall, just about as the apples was bein' gathered in the orchard across our lane, and about the time as you had your new sprigged wesket. I remember, Luke, I remember.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Marks</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Audley wondered where all this was to lead to, and how long he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) would have to sit by the sick man's bed, hearing a conversation that had no meaning to him (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you remember that much, maybe you'll remember more, mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>Luke/Luke Marks/Mr. Marks</b></font>)</div>said Luke. <div class="bookquote">``Can you call to mind my bringing some one home here one night, while Atkinsons was stackin' the last o' their corn?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div><p/>Once more Mr. Audley started violently, and this time he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) looked up earnestly at the face of the speaker, and listened, with a strange, breathless interest, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) scarcely understood himself, to what Luke Marks was saying.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I rek`lect your bringing home Phoebe,''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>the old woman answered, with great animation. <div class="bookquote">``I rek`lect your bringin' Phoebe home to take a cup o' tea, or a little snack o' supper, a mort o' times.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Bother Phoebe,''  (<font color='red'><b>Luke/Luke Marks/Mr. Marks</b></font>)</div>cried Mr. Marks, <div class="bookquote">``who's a talkin' of Phoebe? What's Phoebe, that anybody should go to put theirselves out about her (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>)? Do you remember my bringin' home a gentleman after ten o'clock, one September night; a gentleman as was wet through to the skin, and was covered with mud and slush, and green slime and black muck, from the crown of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) head to the sole of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) foot, and had his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) arm broke, and his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) shoulder swelled up awful; and was such a objeck that nobody would ha' knowed him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>); a gentleman as had to have his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) clothes cut off him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) in some places, and as sat by the kitchen fire, starin' at the coals as if he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had gone mad or stupid-like, and didn't know where he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was, or who he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was; and as had to be cared for like a baby, and dressed, and dried, and washed, and fed with spoonfuls of brandy, that had to be forced between his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) locked teeth, before any life could be got into him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)? Do you remember that, mother?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Luke/Luke Marks/Mr. Marks</b></font>)</div><p/>The old woman nodded, and muttered something to the effect that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) remembered all these circumstances most vividly, now that Luke happened to mention them.

<p/>Robert Audley uttered a wild cry, and fell down upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) knees by the side of the sick man's bed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My God!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) ejaculated, <div class="bookquote">``I think Thee for Thy wondrous mercies. George Talboys is alive!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Wait a bit,''  (<font color='red'><b>Luke/Luke Marks/Mr. Marks</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Marks, <div class="bookquote">``don't you be too fast. Mother, give us down that tin box on the shelf over against the chest of drawers, will you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Luke/Luke Marks/Mr. Marks</b></font>)</div><p/>The old woman obeyed, and after fumbling among broken teacups and milk-jugs, lidless wooden cotton-boxes, and a miscellaneous litter of rags and crockery, produced a tin snuff-box with a sliding lid; a shabby, dirty-looking box enough.

<p/>Robert Audley still knelt by the bedside with his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) face hidden by his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) clasped hands. Luke Marks opened the tin box.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There ain't no money in it, more's the pity,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Marks</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``or if there had been it wouldn't have been let stop very long. But there's summat in it that perhaps you'll think quite as valliable as money, and that's what I'm goin' to give you as a proof that a drunken brute can feel thankful to them as is kind to him (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Marks</b></font>) took out two folded papers, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Marks</b></font>) gave into Robert Audley's hands.

<p/>They were two leaves torn out of a pocket-book, and they were written upon in pencil, and in a handwriting that was quite strange to Mr. Audley--a cramped, stiff, and yet scrawling hand, such as some plowman might have written.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know this writing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>Robert said, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) eagerly unfolded the first of the two papers. <div class="bookquote">``What has this to do with my friend? Why do you show me these?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Suppose you read 'em first,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Marks, <div class="bookquote">``and ask me questions about them afterwards.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Marks</b></font>)</div><p/>The first paper which Robert Audley had unfolded contained the following lines, written in that cramped, yet scrawling hand which was so strange to him (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>):

<p/><div class="bookquote">``MY DEAR FRIEND--I write to you in such utter confusion of mind as perhaps no man ever before suffered. I cannot tell you what has happened to me, I can only tell you that something has happened which will drive me from England a broken-hearted man, to seek some corner of the earth in which I may live and die unknown and forgotten. I can only ask you to forget me. If your friendship could have done me any good, I would have appealed to it. If your counsel could have been any help to me, I would have confided in you. But neither friendship nor counsel can help me; and all I can say to you is this, God bless you for the past, and teach you to forget me in the future. G.T.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>The second paper was addressed to another person, and its contents were briefer than those of the first.

<p/>``HELEN--May God pity and forgive you for that which you have done to-day, as truly as I do. Rest in peace. You shall never hear of me again; to you and to the world I shall henceforth be that which you wished me to be to-day. You need fear no molestation from me. I leave England never to return.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``G.T.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div><p/>Robert Audley sat staring at these lines in hopeless bewilderment. They were not in his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) friend's familiar hand, and yet they purported to be written by him (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) and were signed with his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) initials.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) looked scrutinizingly at the face of Luke Marks, thinking that perhaps some trick was being played upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Marks</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This was not written by George Talboys,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Marks</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It was,''  (<font color='red'><b>Luke/Luke Marks/Mr. Marks</b></font>)</div>answered Luke Marks, <div class="bookquote">``it was written by Mr. Talboys, every line of it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) wrote it with his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) own hand; but it was his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) left hand, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) couldn't use his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) right because of his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) broken arm.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Luke/Luke Marks/Mr. Marks</b></font>)</div><p/>Robert Audley looked up suddenly, and the shadow of suspicion passed away from his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I understand,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I understand. Tell me all; tell me how it was that my poor friend was saved.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I was at work up at Atkinson's farm, last September,''  (<font color='red'><b>Luke/Luke Marks/Mr. Marks</b></font>)</div>said Luke Marks, ``helping to stack the last of the corn, and as the nighest way from the farm to mother's cottage was through the meadows at the back of the Court, I used to come that way, and Phoebe used to stand in the garden wall beyond the lime-walk sometimes, to have a chat with me, knowin' my time o' comin' home.

<p/>``I don't know what Phoebe was a-doin' upon the evenin' of the seventh o' September--I rek`lect the date because Farmer Atkinson paid me my wages all of a lump on that day, and I'd had to sign a bit of a receipt for the money he (<font color='blue'><b>Atkinson</b></font>) give me--I don't know what she (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) was a-doin', but she (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) warn't at the gate agen the lime-walk, so I went round to the other side o' the gardens and jumped across the dry ditch, for I wanted partic`ler to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) that night, as I was goin' away to work upon a farm beyond Chelmsford the next day. Audley church clock struck nine as I was crossin' the meadows between Atkinson's and the Court, and it must have been about a quarter past nine when I got into the kitchen garden.

<p/>``I crossed the garden, and went into the lime-walk; the nighest way to the servants' hall took me through the shrubbery and past the dry well. It was a dark night, but I knew my way well enough about the old place, and the light in the window of the servants' hall looked red and comfortable through the darkness. I was close against the mouth of the dry well when I heard a sound that made my blood creep. It was a groan--a groan of a man in pain, as was lyin' somewhere hid among the bushes. I warn't afraid of ghosts and I warn't afraid of anythink in a general way, but there was somethin in hearin' this groan as chilled me to the very heart, and for a minute I was struck all of a heap, and didn't know what to do. But I heard the groan again, and then I began to search among the bushes. I found a man lyin' hidden under a lot o' laurels, and I thought at first he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was up to no good, and I was a-goin' to collar him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to take him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to the house, when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) caught me by the wrist without gettin' up from the ground, but lookin' at me very earnest, as I could see by the way his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face was turned toward me in the darkness, and asked me who I was, and what I was, and what I had to do with the folks at the Court.

<p/>``There was somethin' in the way he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) spoke that told me he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was a gentleman, though I didn't know him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) from Adam, and couldn't see his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) face; and I answered his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) questions civil.

<p/><div class="bookquote">'''I want to get away from this place,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Marks</b></font>) said, `without bein' seen by any livin' creetur, remember that. I've been lyin' here ever since four o'clock to-day, and I'm half dead, but I want to get away without bein' seen, mind that.''

<p/>``I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) that was easy enough, but I began to think my first thoughts of him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) might have been right enough, after all, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) couldn't have been up to no good to want to sneak away so precious quiet.

<p/><div class="bookquote">''`Can you take me to any place where I can get a change of dry clothes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Marks</b></font>) says, `without half a dozen people knowin' it?''

<p/>``He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>)'d got up into a sittin' attitude by this time, and I could see that his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) right arm hung close by his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) side, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) was in pain.

<p/>``I pointed to his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) arm, and asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) what was the matter with it; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) only answered, very quiet like: ``Broken, my lad, broken. Not that that's much,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Marks</b></font>) says in another tone, speaking to himself like, more than to me. <div class="bookquote">``There's broken hearts as well as broken limbs, and they're not so easy mended.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) I could take him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) to mother's cottage, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) could dry his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) clothes there and welcome.

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>``He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) seemed satisfied with this, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) got himself up by holdin' on to me, for it seemed as if his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) limbs was cramped, the use of 'em was almost gone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">''`You haven't been and fell into the fish-pond, have you, sir?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked.

<p/>``He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) made no answer to my question; he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) didn't seem even to have heard it. I could see now he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) was standin' upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) feet that he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) was a tall, fine-made man, a head and shoulders higher than me.

<p/><div class="bookquote">''`Take me to your mother's cottage,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Marks</b></font>) said, `and get me some dry clothes if you can; I'll pay you well for your trouble.''

<p/>``I knew that the key was mostly left in the wooden gate in the garden wall, so I led him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) that way. He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) could scarcely walk at first, and it was only by leanin' heavily upon my shoulder that he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) managed to get along. I got him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) through the gate, leavin' it unlocked behind me, and trustin' to the chance of that not bein' noticed by the under-gardener, who had the care of the key, and was a careless chap enough. I took him (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) across the meadows, and brought him (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) up here, still keepin' away from the village, and in the fields, where there wasn't a creature to see us at that time o' night; and so I got him (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) into the room down-stairs, where mother was a-sittin' over the fire gettin' my bit o' supper ready for me.

<p/>``I put the strange chap in a chair agen the fire, and then for the first time I had a good look at him (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>). I never see anybody in such a state before. He (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) was all over green damp and muck, and his (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) hands was scratched and cut to pieces. I got his (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) clothes off him (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) how I could, for he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) was like a child in my hands, and sat starin' at the fire as helpless as any baby; only givin' a long heavy sigh now and then, as if his (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) heart was a-goin' to bust. At last he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) dropped into a kind of a doze, a stupid sort of sleep, and began to nod over the fire, so I ran and got a blanket and wrapped him (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) in it, and got him (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) to lie down on the press bedstead in the room under this. I sent mother to bed, and I sat by the fire and watched him (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>), and kep' the fire up till it was just upon daybreak, when he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) `woke up all of a sudden with a start, and said he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) must go, directly this minute.

<p/>``I begged him (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) not to think of such a thing and told him (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) warn't fit to move for ever so long; but he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) must go, and he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) got up, and though he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) staggered like, and at first could hardly stand steady two minutes together, he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) wouldn't be beat, and he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) got me to dress him (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) clothes as I'd dried and cleaned as well as I could while he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) laid asleep. I did manage it at last, but the clothes was awful spoiled, and he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) looked a dreadful objeck, with his (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) pale face and a great cut on his (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) forehead that I'd washed and tied up with a handkercher. He (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) could only get his (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) coat on by buttoning it on round his (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) neck, for he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) couldn't put a sleeve upon his (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) broken arm. But he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) held out agen everything, though he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) groaned every now and then; and what with the scratches and bruises on his (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) hands, and the cut upon his (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) forehead, and his (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) stiff limbs and broken arm, he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>)'d plenty of call to groan; and by the time it was broad daylight he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) was dressed and ready to go.

<p/><div class="bookquote">''`What's the nearest town to this upon the London road?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Marks</b></font>) asked me.

<p/>``I told him (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) as the nighest town was Brentwood.

<p/><div class="bookquote">''`Very well, then,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Marks</b></font>) says, `if you'll go with me to Brentwood, and take me to some surgeon as'll set my arm, I'll give you a five pound note for that and all your other trouble.''

<p/>``I told him (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) that I was ready and willin' to do anything as he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) wanted done; and asked him (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) if I shouldn't go and see if I could borrow a cart from some of the neighbors to drive him (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) over in, for I told him (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) it was a good six miles' walk.

<p/>``He (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) shook his (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) head. No, no, no, he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) said, he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) didn't want anybody to know anything about him (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>)'d rather walk it.

<p/>``He (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) did walk it; and he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) walked like a good `un, too; though I know as every step he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) took o' them six miles he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) took in pain; but he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) held out as he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>)'d held out before; I never see such a chap to hold out in all my blessed life. He (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) had to stop sometimes and lean agen a gateway to get his (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) breath; but he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) held out still, till at last we got into Brentwood, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) says, ``Take me to the nighest surgeon<div class="bookquote">``s,''  (<font color='red'><b>the surgeon</b></font>)</div>and I waited while he (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) had his (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) arm set in splints, which took a precious long time. The surgeon wanted him (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) to stay in Brentwood till he (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) was better, but he (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) said it warn't to be heard on, he (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) must get up to London without a minute's loss of time; so the surgeon made him (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) as comfortable as he (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) could, considering and tied up his (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) arm in a sling.''

<p/>Robert Audley started. A circumstance connected with his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) visit to Liverpool dashed suddenly back upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) memory. He (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) remembered the clerk who had called him (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) back to say there was a passenger who took his (<font color='blue'><b>passenger</b></font>) berth on board the Victoria Regia within an hour or so of the vessel's sailing; a young man with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) arm in a sling, who had called himself by some common name, which Robert had forgotten.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``When his (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) arm was dressed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Luke/Luke Marks/Mr. Marks</b></font>)</div>continued Luke, ``he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) says to the surgeon, ``Can you give me a pencil to write something before I go away?'' The surgeon smiles and shakes his (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) head: ``You'll never be able to write with that there hand to-day,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) says, pointin' to the arm as had just been dressed. ``P'raps not,<div class="bookquote">'' the young chap answers, quiet enough, `but I can write with the other,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Can't I write it for you?''  (<font color='red'><b>the surgeon</b></font>)</div>says the surgeon. <div class="bookquote">``No, thank you,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>answers the other; `what I've got to write is private. If you can give me a couple of envelopes, I'll be obliged to you.''

<p/>``With that the surgeon goes to fetch the envelopes, and the young chap takes a pocket-book out of his (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) coat pocket with his (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) left hand; the cover was wet and dirty, but the inside was clean enough, and he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) tears out a couple of leaves and begins to write upon 'em as you see; and he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) writes dreadful awk`ard with his (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) left hand, and he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) writes slow, but he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) contrives to finish what you see, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) puts the two bits o' writin' into the envelopes as the surgeon brings him (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) seals 'em up, and he (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) puts a pencil cross upon one of 'em, and nothing on the other: and then he (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) pays the surgeon for his (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) trouble, and the surgeon says, ain't there nothin' more he (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) can do for him (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>), and can't he (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) persuade him (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) to stay in Brentwood till his (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) arm's better; but he (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) says no, no, it ain't possible; and then he (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) says to me, <div class="bookquote">``Come along o' me to the railway station, and I'll give you what I've promised.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``So I went to the station with him (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>). We was in time to catch the train as stops at Brentwood at half after eight, and we had five minutes to spare. So he (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) takes me into a corner of the platform, and he (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) says, ``I wants you to deliver these here letters for me,'' which I told him (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) I was willin'. ``Very well, then,<div class="bookquote">'' he (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) says; `look here; you know Audley Court?''

(<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and I said, <div class="bookquote">``Yes, I've heerd tell on him (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>), and I've heerd as he (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) was a reg`lar swell, but affable and free-spoken' -LRB-for I heerd 'em tell on you, you know-RRB-,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Luke added, parenthetically. <div class="bookquote">''`Now look here,''  (<font color='red'><b>Luke/Luke Marks/Mr. Marks</b></font>)</div>the young chap says, `you're to give this other letter to Mr. Robert Audley, whose a-stayin' at the Sun Inn, in the village;' and I tells him (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) it's all right, as I've know'd the Sun ever since I was a baby. So then he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) gives me the second letter, what's got nothing wrote upon the envelope, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) gives me a five-pound note, accordin' to promise; and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) says, ``Good-day, and thank you for all your trouble,<div class="bookquote">``and he (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) gets into a second-class carriage; and the last I sees of him (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) is a face as white as a sheet of writin' paper, and a great patch of stickin'-plaster criss-crossed upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) forehead.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``I went back to Audley, and I went straight to the Sun Inn, and asked for you, meanin' to deliver both letters faithful, so help me God! then; but the landlord told me as you'd started off that mornin' for London, and he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) didn't know when you'd come back, and he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) didn't know the name o' the place where you lived in London, though he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) thought it was in one o' them law courts, such as Westminster Hall or Doctors' Commons, or somethin' like that. So what was I to do? I couldn't send a letter by post, not knowin' where to direct to, and I couldn't give it into your own hands, and I'd been told partickler not to let anybody else know of it; so I'd nothing to do but to wait and see if you come back, and bide my time for givin' of it to you.

<p/>``I thought I'd go over to the Court in the evenin' and see Phoebe, and find out from her (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) when there'd be a chance of seein' her (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) lady, for I know'd she (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) could manage it if she (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) liked. So I didn't go to work that day, though I ought to ha' done, and I lounged and idled about until it was nigh upon dusk, and then I goes down to the meadows behind the Court, and there I finds Phoebe sure enough, waitin' agen the wooden door in the wall, on the lookout for me.

<p/>``I hadn't been talkin' to her (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) long before I see there was somethink wrong with her (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) and I told her (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) as much.

<p/>``Well,' she (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) says, <div class="bookquote">``I ain't quite myself this evenin', for I had a upset yesterday, and I ain't got over it yet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">'''A upset,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I says. <div class="bookquote">``You had a quarrel with your missus, I suppose.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``She (<font color='blue'><b>missus</b></font>) didn't answer me directly, but she (<font color='blue'><b>missus</b></font>) smiled the queerest smile as ever I see, and presently she (<font color='blue'><b>missus</b></font>) says:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, Luke, it weren't nothin' o' that kind; and what's more, nobody could be friendlier toward me than my lady.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``I couldn't make out this, for it was only a few days before as she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)'d told me her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) missus was selfish and extravagant, and we might wait a long time before we could get what we wanted from her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>).

<p/>``So I says to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), ``Why, this is rather sudden like, Phoebe;' and she (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) says, ``Yes, it is sudden;' and she (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) smiles again, just the same sort of smile as before. Upon that I turns round upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebe</b></font>) sharp, and says:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll tell you what it is, my gal, you're a-keepin' somethink from me; somethink you've been told, or somethink you've found out; and if you think you're a-goin' to try that game on with me, you'll find you're very much mistaken; and so I give you warnin'.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``But she (<font color='blue'><b>gal</b></font>) laughed it off like, and says, <div class="bookquote">``Lor' Luke, what could have put such fancies into your head?''

<p/>``So you see both my Lady Audley and her (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) maid thought as the gentleman as I'd seen safe off by the London train was lying dead at the bottom of the well.

<p/>``So I kep' the letter and kep' my secret, and my lady kep' hern.

 (<font color='red'><b>Luke/Luke Marks/Mr. Marks</b></font>)</div><p/>Luke Marks had finished his (<font color='blue'><b>Marks</b></font>) story, and lay quietly enough, exhausted by having talked so long.

<p/>But Robert did not lecture him (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) had no fancy for an office which he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) did not think himself fitted to perform.

<p/>Robert Audley sat until long after daybreak with the sick man, who fell into a heavy slumber a short time after he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) had finished his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) story.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) could not sleep; he (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) could only think of the story he (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) had heard.

<p/>Clara Talboys returned to Dorsetshire, to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) father that his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) only son had sailed for Australia upon the 9th of September, and that it was most probable he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) yet lived, and would return to claim the forgiveness of the father he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had never very particularly injured; except in the matter of having made that terrible matrimonial mistake which had exercised so fatal an influence upon his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) youth.

<p/>Mr. Harcourt-Talboys was fairly nonplused. Junius Brutus had never been placed in such a position as this, and seeing no way of getting out of this dilemma by acting after his (<font color='blue'><b>Brutus</b></font>) favorite model, Mr. Talboys was fain to be natural for once in his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) life, and to confess that he (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) had suffered much uneasiness and pain of mind about his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) only son since his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) conversation with Robert Audley, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) would be heartily glad to take his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) poor boy to his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) arms, whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) should return to England. But when was he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) likely to return? and how was he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) to be communicated with? That was the question. Robert Audley remembered the advertisements which he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) had caused to be inserted in the Melbourne and Sydney papers. If George had re-entered either city alive, how was it that no notice had ever been taken of that advertisement? Was it likely that his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) friend would be indifferent to his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) uneasiness? But then, again, it was just possible that George Talboys had not happened to see this advertisement; and, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) had traveled under a feigned name, neither his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) fellow passengers nor the captain of the vessel would have been able to identify him (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) with the person advertised for. What was to be done? Must they wait patiently till George grew weary of his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) exile, and returned to his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) friends who loved him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)? or were there any means to be taken by which his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) return might be hastened? Robert Audley was at fault! Perhaps, in the unspeakable relief of mind which he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) had experienced upon the discovery of his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) friend's escape, he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) was unable to look beyond the one fact of that providential preservation.

<p/>In this state of mind he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) went down to Dorsetshire to pay a visit to Mr. Talboys, who had given way to a perfect torrent of generous impulses, and had gone so far as to invite his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) son's friend to share the prim hospitality of the square, red brick mansion.

<p/>Mr. Talboys had only two sentiments upon the subject of George's story; one was a natural relief and happiness in the thought that his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) son had been saved, the other was an earnest wish that my lady had been his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) wife, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) might thus have had the pleasure of making a signal example of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is not for me to blame you, Mr. Audley,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``for having smuggled this guilty woman out of the reach of justice, and thus, as I may say, paltered with the laws of your country. I can only remark that, had the lady fallen into my hands, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) would have been very differently treated.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>It was in the middle of April when Robert Audley found himself once more under those black fir-trees beneath which his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) wandering thoughts had so often stayed since his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) first meeting with Clara Talboys. There were primroses and early violets in the hedges now, and the streams, which, upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) first visit, had been hard and frost-bound as the heart of Harcourt Talboys, had thawed, like that gentleman, and ran merrily under the blackthorn bushes in the capricious April sunshine.

<p/>Robert had a prim bedroom, and an uncompromising dressing-room allotted him (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) in the square house, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) woke every morning upon a metallic spring mattress, which always gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) the idea of sleeping upon some musical instrument, to see the sun glaring in upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) through the square, white blinds and lighting up the two lackered urns which adorned the foot of the blue iron bedstead, until they blazed like two tiny brazen lamps of the Roman period. He (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) emulated Mr. Harcourt Talboys in the matter of shower-baths and cold water, and emerged prim and blue as that gentleman himself, as the clock in the hall struck seven, to join the master of the house in his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) ante-breakfast constitutional under the fir-trees in the stiff plantation.

<p/>But there was generally a third person who assisted in the constitutional promenades, and that third person was Clara Talboys, who used to walk by her (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) father's side, more beautiful than the morning--for that was sometimes dull and cloudy, while she (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) was always fresh and bright--in a broad-leaved straw-hat and flapping blue ribbons, one quarter of an inch of which Mr. Audley would have esteemed a prouder decoration than ever adorned a favored creature's button-hole.

<p/>At first they were very ceremonious toward each other, and were only familiar and friendly upon the one subject of George's adventures; but little by little a pleasant intimacy arose between them, and before the first three weeks of Robert's visit had elapsed, Miss Talboys made him (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) happy, by taking him (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) seriously in hand and lecturing him (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) on the purposeless life he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) had led so long, and the little use he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) had made of the talents and opportunities that had been given to him (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>).

<p/>How pleasant it was to be lectured by the woman he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) loved! How pleasant it was to humiliate himself and depreciate himself before her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)! How delightful it was to get such splendid opportunities of hinting that if his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) life had been sanctified by an object he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) might indeed have striven to be something better than an idle flaneur upon the smooth pathways that have no particular goal; that, blessed by the ties which would have given a solemn purpose to every hour of his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) existence, he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) might indeed have fought the battle earnestly and unflinchingly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) generally wound up with a gloomy insinuation to the effect that it was only likely he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) would drop quietly over the edge of the Temple Gardens some afternoon when the river was bright and placid in the low sunlight, and the little children had gone home to their tea.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you think I can read French novels and smoke mild Turkish until I am three-score-and-ten, Miss Talboys?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) asked. <div class="bookquote">``Do you think there will not come a day in which my meerschaums will be foul, and the French novels more than usually stupid, and life altogether such a dismal monotony that I shall want to get rid of it somehow or other?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I am sorry to say that while this hypocritical young barrister was holding forth in this despondent way, he (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) had mentally sold up his (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) bachelor possessions, including all Michel Levy's publications, and half a dozen solid silver-mounted meerschaums; pensioned off Mrs. Maloney, and laid out two or three thousand pounds in the purchase of a few acres of verdant shrubbery and sloping lawn, embosomed amid which there should be a fairy cottage ornée, whose rustic casements should glimmer out of bowers of myrtle and clematis to see themselves reflected in the purple bosom of the lake.

<p/>Of course, Clara Talboys was far from discovering the drift of these melancholy lamentations. She (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) recommended Mr. Audley to read hard and think seriously of his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) profession, and begin life in real earnest. It was a hard, dry sort of existence, perhaps, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) recommended; a life of serious work and application, in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) should strive to be useful to his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) fellow-creatures, and win a reputation for himself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'd do all that,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) thought, <div class="bookquote">``and do it earnestly, if I could be sure of a reward for my labor. If she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) would accept my reputation when it was won, and support me in the struggle by her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) beloved companionship. But what if she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) sends me away to fight the battle, and marries some hulking country squire while my back is turned?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Being naturally of a vacillating and dilatory disposition, there is no saying how long Mr. Audley might have kept his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) secret, fearful to speak and break the charm of that uncertainty which, though not always hopeful, was very seldom quite despairing, had not he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) been hurried by the impulse of an unguarded moment into a full confession of the truth.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) had stayed five weeks at Grange Heath, and felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Heath</b></font>) could not, in common decency, stay any longer; so he (<font color='blue'><b>Heath</b></font>) had packed his (<font color='blue'><b>Heath</b></font>) portmanteau one pleasant May morning, and had announced his (<font color='blue'><b>Heath</b></font>) departure.

<p/>Mr. Talboys was not the sort of man to utter any passionate lamentations at the prospect of losing his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) guest, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) expressed himself with a cool cordiality which served with him (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) as the strongest demonstration of friendship.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We have got on very well together, Mr. Audley,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``and you have been pleased to appear sufficiently happy in the quiet routine of our orderly household; nay, more, you have conformed to our little domestic regulations in a manner which I cannot refrain from saying I take as an especial compliment to myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Robert bowed. How thankful he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) was to the good fortune which had never suffered him (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) to oversleep the signal of the clanging bell, or led him (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) away beyond the ken of clocks at Mr. Talboys' luncheon hour.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I trust as we have got on so remarkably well together,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/George Talboys/Mr. Talboys</b></font>)</div>Mr. Talboys resumed, <div class="bookquote">``you will do me the honor of repeating your visit to Dorsetshire whenever you feel inclined. You will find plenty of sport among my farms, and you will meet with every politeness and attention from my tenants, if you like to bring your gun with you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>George/George Talboys/Mr. Talboys</b></font>)</div><p/>Robert responded most heartily to these friendly overtures. He (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) declared that there was no earthly occupation that was more agreeable to him (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) than partridge-shooting, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) should be only too delighted to avail himself of the privilege so kindly offered to him (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) could not help glancing toward Clara as he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) said this. The perfect lids drooped a little over the brown eyes, and the faintest shadow of a blush illuminated the beautiful face.

<p/>But this was the young barrister's last day in Elysium, and there must be a dreary interval of days and nights and weeks and months before the first of September would give him (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) an excuse for returning to Dorsetshire; a dreary interval which fresh colored young squires or fat widowers of eight-and-forty, might use to his (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) disadvantage. It was no wonder, therefore, that he (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) contemplated this dismal prospect with moody despair, and was bad company for Miss Talboys that morning.

<p/>But in the evening after dinner, when the sun was low in the west, and Harcourt Talboys closeted in his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) library upon some judicial business with his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) lawyer and a tenant farmer, Mr. Audley grew a little more agreeable. He (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) stood by Clara's side in one of the long windows of the drawing-room, watching the shadows deepening in the sky and the rosy light growing every moment rosier as the sun died out. He (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) could not help enjoying that quiet tête-a-tête, though the shadow of the next morning's express which was to carry him (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) away to London loomed darkly across the pathway of his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) joy. He (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) could not help being happy in her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) presence; forgetful of the past, reckless of the future.

<p/>They talked of the one subject which was always a bond of union between them. They talked of her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) lost brother George. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) spoke of him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) in a very melancholy tone this evening. How could she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) be otherwise than sad, remembering that if he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) lived--and she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) was not even sure of that--he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) was a lonely wanderer far away from all who loved him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>), and carrying the memory of a blighted life wherever he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) went.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I cannot think how papa can be so resigned to my poor brother's absence,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``for he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) does love him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>), Mr. Audley; even you must have seen lately that he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) does love him (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>). But I cannot think how he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) can so quietly submit to his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) absence. If I were a man, I would go to Australia, and find him (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>), and bring him (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) back; if he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) was still to be found among the living,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) added, in a lower voice.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) face away from Robert, and looked out at the darkening sky. He (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) laid his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) hand upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) arm. It trembled in spite of him (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>), and his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) voice trembled, too, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) spoke to her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Shall I go to look for your brother?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You!''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) head, and looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) earnestly through her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) tears. <div class="bookquote">``You, Mr. Audley! Do you think that I could ask you to make such a sacrifice for me, or for those I love?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And do you think, Clara, that I should think any sacrifice too great a one if it were made for you? Do you think there is any voyage I would refuse to take, if I knew that you would welcome me when I came home, and thank me for having served you faithfully? I will go from one end of the continent of Australia to the other to look for your brother, if you please, Clara; and will never return alive unless I bring him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) with me, and will take my chance of what reward you shall give me for my labor.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) head was bent, and it was some moments before she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) answered him (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are very good and generous, Mr. Audley,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) said, at last, <div class="bookquote">``and I feel this offer too much to be able to thank you for it. But what you speak of could never be. By what right could I accept such a sacrifice?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``By the right which makes me your bounden slave forever and ever, whether you will or no. By right of the love I bear you, Clara,''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Audley/Mr. Audley</b></font>)</div>cried Mr. Audley, dropping on his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) knees--rather awkwardly, it must be confessed--and covering a soft little hand, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) had found half hidden among the folds of a silken dress, with passionate kisses.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I love you, Clara,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I love you. You may call for your father, and have me turned out of the house this moment, if you like; but I shall go on loving you all the same; and I shall love you forever and ever, whether you will or no.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The little hand was drawn away from his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>), but not with a sudden or angry gesture, and it rested for one moment lightly and tremulously upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) dark hair.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Clara, Clara!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) murmured, in a low, pleading voice, <div class="bookquote">``shall I go to Australia to look for your brother?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>There was no answer. I don't know how it is, but there is scarcely anything more delicious than silence in such cases. Every moment of hesitation is a tacit avowal; every pause is a tender confession.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Shall we both go, dearest? Shall we go as man and wife? Shall we go together, my dear love, and bring our brother back between us?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harcourt Talboys/Mr. Harcourt Talboys</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Harcourt Talboys, coming into the lamplit room a quarter of an hour afterward, found Robert Audley alone, and had to listen to a revelation which very much surprised him (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>). Like all self-sufficient people, he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) was tolerably blind to everything that happened under his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) nose, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) had fully believed that his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) own society, and the Spartan regularity of his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) household, had been the attractions which had made Dorsetshire delightful to his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) guest.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) was rather disappointed, therefore; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) bore his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) disappointment pretty well, and expressed a placid and rather stoical satisfaction at the turn which affairs had taken.

<p/>So Robert Audley went back to London, to surrender his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) chambers in Figtree Court, and to make all due inquiries about such ships as sailed from Liverpool for Sydney in the month of June.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) had lingered until after luncheon at Grange Heath, and it was in the dusky twilight that he (<font color='blue'><b>Heath</b></font>) entered the shady Temple courts and found his (<font color='blue'><b>Heath</b></font>) way to his (<font color='blue'><b>Heath</b></font>) chambers. He (<font color='blue'><b>Heath</b></font>) found Mrs. Maloney scrubbing the stairs, as was her (<font color='blue'><b>Maloney</b></font>) wont upon a Saturday evening, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Heath</b></font>) had to make his (<font color='blue'><b>Heath</b></font>) way upward amidst an atmosphere of soapy steam, that made the balusters greasy under his (<font color='blue'><b>Heath</b></font>) touch.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There's lots of letters, yer honor,''  (<font color='red'><b>the laundress</b></font>)</div>the laundress said, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Maloney</b></font>) rose from her (<font color='blue'><b>Maloney</b></font>) knees and flattened herself against the wall to enable Robert to pass her (<font color='blue'><b>Maloney</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``and there's some parcels, and there's a gentleman which has called ever so many times, and is waitin' to-night, for I towld him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) you'd written to me to say your rooms were to be aired.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) opened the door of his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) sitting-room, and walked in. The canaries were singing their farewell to the setting sun, and the faint, yellow light was flickering upon the geranium leaves. The visitor, whoever he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) was, sat with his (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) back to the window and his (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) head bent upon his (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) breast. But he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) started up as Robert Audley entered the room, and the young man uttered a great cry of delight and surprise, and opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) arms to his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) lost friend, George Talboys.

<p/>We know how much Robert had to tell. He (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) touched lightly and tenderly upon that subject which he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) knew was cruelly painful to his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) friends; he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) said very little of the wretched woman who was wearing out the remnant of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) wicked life in the quiet suburb of the forgotten Belgian city.

<p/>George Talboys spoke very briefly of that sunny seventh of September, upon which he (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) had left his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) friend sleeping by the trout stream while he (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) went to accuse his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) false wife of that conspiracy which had well nigh broken his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) heart.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``God knows that from the moment in which I sunk into the black pit, knowing the treacherous hand that had sent me to what might have been my death, my chief thought was of the safety of the woman who had betrayed me. I fell upon my feet upon a mass of slush and mire, but my shoulder was bruised, and my arm broken against the side of the well. I was stunned and dazed for a few minutes, but I roused myself by an effort, for I felt that the atmosphere I breathed was deadly. I had my Australian experiences to help me in my peril; I could climb like a cat. The stones of which the well was built were rugged and irregular, and I was able to work my way upward by planting my feet in the interstices of the stones, and resting my back at times against the opposite side of the well, helping myself as well as I could with my hands, though one arm was crippled. It was hard work, Bob, and it seems strange that a man who had long professed himself weary of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) life, should take so much trouble to preserve it. I think I must have been working upward of half an hour before I got to the top; I know the time seemed an eternity of pain and peril. It was impossible for me to leave the place until after dark without being observed, so I hid myself behind a clump of laurel-bushes, and lay down on the grass faint and exhausted to wait for nightfall. The man who found me there told you the rest. Robert.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, my poor old friend.--yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) told me all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>George/George Talboys/Mr. Talboys</b></font>)</div><p/>George had never returned to Australia after all. He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) had gone on board the Victoria Regia, but had afterward changed his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) berth for one in another vessel belonging to the same owners, and had gone to New York, where he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) had stayed as long as he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) could endure the loneliness of an existence which separated him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) from every friend he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had ever known.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Jonathan was very kind to me, Bob,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``I had enough money to enable me to get on pretty well in my own quiet way and I meant to have started for the California gold fields to get more when that was gone. I might have made plenty of friends had I pleased, but I carried the old bullet in my breast; and what sympathy could I have with men who knew nothing of my grief? I yearned for the strong grasp of your hand, Bob; the friendly touch of the hand which had guided me through the darkest passage of my life.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER XLI.

<p/>AT PEACE.

<p/>Two years have passed since the May twilight in which Robert found his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) old friend; and Mr. Audley's dream of a fairy cottage has been realized between Teddington Locks and Hampton Bridge, where, amid a little forest of foliage, there is a fantastical dwelling place of rustic woodwork, whose latticed windows look out upon the river. Here, among the lilies and the rushes on the sloping bank, a brave boy of eight years old plays with a toddling baby, who peers wonderingly from his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) nurse's arms at that other baby in the purple depth of the quiet water.

<p/>Mr. Audley is a rising man upon the home circuit by this time, and has distinguished himself in the great breach of promise case of Hobbs v. Nobbs, and has convulsed the court by his (<font color='blue'><b>Hobbs</b></font>) deliciously comic rendering of the faithless Nobb's amatory correspondence. The handsome dark-eyed boy is Master George Talboys, who declines musa at Eton, and fishes for tadpoles in the clear water under the spreading umbrage beyond the ivied walls of the academy. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) comes very often to the fairy cottage to see his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) father, who lives there with his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) sister and his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) sister's husband; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) is very happy with his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) Uncle Robert, his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) Aunt Clara, and the pretty baby who has just begun to toddle on the smooth lawn that slopes down to the water's brink, upon which there is a little Swiss boat-house and landing-stage where Robert and George moor their slender wherries.

<p/>Other people come to the cottage near Teddington. A bright, merry-hearted girl, and a gray-bearded gentleman, who has survived the trouble of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) life, and battled with it as a Christian should.

<p/>It is more than a year since a black-edged letter, written upon foreign paper, came to Robert Audley, to announce the death of a certain Madame Taylor, who had expired peacefully at Villebrumeuse, dying after a long illness, which Monsieur Val describes as a maladie de langueur.

<p/>Another visitor comes to the cottage in this bright summer of 1861--a frank, generous hearted young man, who tosses the baby and plays with Georgey, and is especially great in the management of the boats, which are never idle when Sir Harry Towers is at Teddington.

<p/>There is a pretty rustic smoking-room over the Swiss boat-house, in which the gentlemen sit and smoke in the summer evenings, and whence they are summoned by Clara and Alicia to drink tea, and eat strawberries and cream upon the lawn.

<p/>Audley Court is shut up, and a grim old housekeeper reigns paramount in the mansion which my lady's ringing laughter once made musical. A curtain hangs before the pre-Raphaelite portrait; and the blue mold which artists dread gathers upon the Wouvermans and Poussins, the Cuyps and Tintorettis. The house is often shown to inquisitive visitors, though the baronet is not informed of that fact, and people admire my lady's rooms, and ask many questions about the pretty, fair-haired woman who died abroad.

<p/>Sir Michael has no fancy to return to the familiar dwelling-place in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) once dreamed a brief dream of impossible happiness. He (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) remains in London until Alicia shall be Lady Towers, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) is to remove to a house he (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) has lately bought in Hertfordshire, on the borders of his (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) son-in-law's estate. George Talboys is very happy with his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) sister and his (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) old friend. He (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) is a young man yet, remember, and it is not quite impossible that he (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) may, by-and-by, find some one who will console him (<font color='blue'><b>Talboys</b></font>) for the past. That dark story of the past fades little by little every day, and there may come a time in which the shadow my lady's wickedness has cast upon the young man's life will utterly vanish away.

<p/>The meerschaum and the French novels have been presented to a young Templar with whom Robert Audley had been friendly in his (<font color='blue'><b>Audley</b></font>) bachelor days; and Mrs. Maloney has a little pension, paid her (<font color='blue'><b>Maloney</b></font>) quarterly, for her (<font color='blue'><b>Maloney</b></font>) care of the canaries and geraniums.

<p/>I hope no one will take objection to my story because the end of it leaves the good people all happy and at peace. If my experience of life has not been very long, it has at least been manifold; and I can safely subscribe to that which a mighty king and a great philosopher declared, when he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) said, that neither the experience of his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) youth nor of his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) age had ever shown him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``the righteous forsaken, nor his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) seed begging their bread.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>THE END.
