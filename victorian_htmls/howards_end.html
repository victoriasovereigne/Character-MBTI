<p/>Title: Howards End

<p/>Author: E. M. Forster

<p/>Release Date: November, 2001 -LSB-Etext #2891-RSB-
-LSB-Yes, we are about one year ahead of schedule-RSB-

<p/>Edition: 10

<p/>*The Project Gutenberg Etext of Howards End, by E. M. Forster*
*****This file should be named 2891.txt or 2891.zip*****

<p/>This etext was prepared by Richard Fane, Haddonfield NJ

<p/>Project Gutenberg Etexts are usually created from multiple editions,
all of which are in the Public Domain in the United States, unless a
copyright notice is included. Therefore, we usually do NOT keep any
of these books in compliance with any particular paper edition.

<p/>We are now trying to release all our books one year in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
Please be encouraged to send us error messages even years after
the official publication date.

<p/>Please note: neither this list nor its contents are final till
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg Etexts is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month. A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.

<p/>Most people start at our sites at:
http://gutenberg.net
http://promo.net/pg


<p/>Those of you who want to download any Etext before announcement
can surf to them as follows, and just download by date; this is
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.

<p/>http://metalab.unc.edu/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext01
or
ftp://metalab.unc.edu/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext01

<p/>Or /etext00, 99, 98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90

<p/>Just search by the first five letters of the filename you want,
as it appears in our Newsletters.


<p/>Information about Project Gutenberg -LRB-one page-RRB-

<p/>We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work. The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.. This
projected audience is one hundred million readers. If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour this year as we release fifty new Etext
files per month, or 500 more Etexts in 2000 for a total of 3000+
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
should reach over 300 billion Etexts given away by year's end.

<p/>The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by December 31, 2001. -LSB-10,000 x 100,000,000 = 1 Trillion-RSB-
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.

<p/>At our revised rates of production, we will reach only one-third
of that goal by the end of 2001, or about 3,333 Etexts unless we
manage to get some real funding.

<p/>Something is needed to create a future for Project Gutenberg for
the next 100 years.

<p/>We need your donations more than ever!

<p/>Howards End

<p/>by E. M. Forster




<p/>Chapter 1

<p/>One may as well begin with Helen's letters to her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) sister.


<p/>HOWARDS END,
TUESDAY.

<p/>Dearest Meg,

<p/>It isn't going to be what we expected. It is old and
little, and altogether delightful--red brick. We can
scarcely pack in as it is, and the dear knows what will
happen when Paul -LRB-younger son-RRB- arrives tomorrow. From hall
you go right or left into dining-room or drawing-room. Hall
itself is practically a room. You open another door in it,
and there are the stairs going up in a sort of tunnel to the
first-floor. Three bedrooms in a row there, and three
attics in a row above. That isn't all the house really, but
it's all that one notices--nine windows as you look up from
the front garden.

<p/>Then there's a very big wych-elm--to the left as you
look up--leaning a little over the house, and standing on
the boundary between the garden and meadow. I quite love
that tree already. Also ordinary elms, oaks--no nastier
than ordinary oaks--pear-trees, apple-trees, and a vine. No
silver birches, though. However, I must get on to my host
and hostess. I only wanted to show that it isn't the least
what we expected. Why did we settle that their house would
be all gables and wiggles, and their garden all
gamboge-coloured paths? I believe simply because we
associate them with expensive hotels--Mrs. Wilcox trailing
in beautiful dresses down long corridors, Mr. Wilcox
bullying porters, etc.. We females are that unjust.

<p/>I shall be back Saturday; will let you know train
later. They are as angry as I am that you did not come too;
really Tibby is too tiresome, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) starts a new mortal disease
every month. How could he (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) have got hay fever in London?
and even if he (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) could, it seems hard that you should give up
a visit to hear a schoolboy sneeze. Tell him (<font color='blue'><b>schoolboy</b></font>) that Charles
Wilcox -LRB-the son who is here-RRB- has hay fever too, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>)'s
brave, and gets quite cross when we inquire after it. Men
like the Wilcoxes would do Tibby a power of good. But you
won't agree, and I'd better change the subject.

<p/>This long letter is because I'm writing before
breakfast. Oh, the beautiful vine leaves! The house is
covered with a vine. I looked out earlier, and Mrs. Wilcox
was already in the garden. She (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) evidently loves it. No
wonder she (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) sometimes looks tired. She (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) was watching the
large red poppies come out. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) walked off the lawn to
the meadow, whose corner to the right I can just see.
Trail, trail, went her (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) long dress over the sopping grass,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) came back with her (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) hands full of the hay that was
cut yesterday--I suppose for rabbits or something, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>)
kept on smelling it. The air here is delicious. Later on I
heard the noise of croquet balls, and looked out again, and
it was Charles Wilcox practising; they are keen on all
games. Presently he (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) started sneezing and had to stop. Then
I hear more clicketing, and it is Mr. Wilcox practising, and
then, `a-tissue, a-tissue': he (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) has to stop too. Then Evie
comes out, and does some calisthenic exercises on a machine
that is tacked on to a greengage-tree--they put everything
to use--and then she (<font color='blue'><b>Evie</b></font>) says <div class="bookquote">``a-tissue,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and in she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) goes. And
finally Mrs. Wilcox reappears, trail, trail, still smelling
hay and looking at the flowers. I inflict all this on you
because once you said that life is sometimes life and
sometimes only a drama, and one must learn to distinguish
t`other from which, and up to now I have always put that
down as <div class="bookquote">``Meg's clever nonsense.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>But this morning, it really
does seem not life but a play, and it did amuse me
enormously to watch the W's. Now Mrs. Wilcox has come in.

<p/>I am going to wear -LSB-omission-RSB-. Last night Mrs. Wilcox
wore an -LSB-omission-RSB-, and Evie -LSB-omission-RSB-. So it isn't
exactly a go-as-you-please place, and if you shut your eyes
it still seems the wiggly hotel that we expected. Not if
you open them. The dog-roses are too sweet. There is a
great hedge of them over the lawn--magnificently tall, so
that they fall down in garlands, and nice and thin at the
bottom, so that you can see ducks through it and a cow.
These belong to the farm, which is the only house near us.
There goes the breakfast gong. Much love. Modified love to
Tibby. Love to Aunt Juley; how good of her (<font color='blue'><b>Juley</b></font>) to come and keep
you company, but what a bore. Burn this. Will write again
Thursday.

<p/>Helen


<p/>HOWARDS END,
FRIDAY.

<p/>Dearest Meg,

<p/>I am having a glorious time. I like them all. Mrs.
Wilcox, if quieter than in Germany, is sweeter than ever,
and I never saw anything like her (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) steady unselfishness, and
the best of it is that the others do not take advantage of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>). They are the very happiest, jolliest family that you
can imagine. I do really feel that we are making friends.
The fun of it is that they think me a noodle, and say so--at
least Mr. Wilcox does--and when that happens, and one
doesn't mind, it's a pretty sure test, isn't it? He (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) says
the most horrid things about women's suffrage so nicely, and
when I said I believed in equality he (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) just folded his (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) arms
and gave me such a setting down as I've never had. Meg,
shall we ever learn to talk less? I never felt so ashamed
of myself in my life. I couldn't point to a time when men
had been equal, nor even to a time when the wish to be equal
had made them happier in other ways. I couldn't say a
word. I had just picked up the notion that equality is good
from some book--probably from poetry, or you. Anyhow, it's
been knocked into pieces, and, like all people who are
really strong, Mr. Wilcox did it without hurting me. On the
other hand, I laugh at them for catching hay fever. We live
like fighting-cocks, and Charles takes us out every day in
the motor--a tomb with trees in it, a hermit's house, a
wonderful road that was made by the Kings of
Mercia--tennis--a cricket match--bridge--and at night we
squeeze up in this lovely house. The whole clan's here
now--it's like a rabbit warren. Evie is a dear. They want
me to stop over Sunday--I suppose it won't matter if I do.
Marvellous weather and the view's marvellous--views westward
to the high ground. Thank you for your letter. Burn this.

<p/>Your affectionate
Helen


<p/>HOWARDS END,
SUNDAY.

<p/>Dearest, dearest Meg,--I do not know what you will say:
Paul and I are in love--the younger son who only came here
Wednesday.


<p/>Chapter 2

<p/>Margaret glanced at her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) sister's note and pushed it over the
breakfast-table to her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) aunt. There was a moment's hush, and
then the flood-gates opened.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can tell you nothing, Aunt Juley. I know no more
than you do. We met--we only met the father and mother
abroad last spring. I know so little that I didn't even
know their son's name. It's all so--''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) waved her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) hand
and laughed a little.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``In that case it is far too sudden.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who knows, Aunt Juley, who knows?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But, Margaret dear, I mean we mustn't be unpractical

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll go for her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) other letters,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>said Margaret. ``No, I

We met the Wilcoxes on an awful expedition that we made from
Heidelberg to Speyer. Helen and I had got it into our heads
that there was a grand old cathedral at Speyer--the
Archbishop of Speyer was one of the seven electors--you
know--``Speyer, Maintz, and Koln.<div class="bookquote">'' Those three sees once
commanded the Rhine Valley and got it the name of Priest Street.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I still feel quite uneasy about this business, Margaret.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``The train crossed by a bridge of boats, and at first
sight it looked quite fine. But oh, in five minutes we had
seen the whole thing. The cathedral had been ruined,
absolutely ruined, by restoration; not an inch left of the
original structure. We wasted a whole day, and came across
the Wilcoxes as we were eating our sandwiches in the public
gardens. They too, poor things, had been taken in--they
were actually stopping at Speyer--and they rather liked
Helen insisting that they must fly with us to Heidelberg.
As a matter of fact, they did come on next day. We all took
some drives together. They knew us well enough to ask Helen
to come and see them--at least, I was asked too, but Tibby's
illness prevented me, so last Monday she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) went alone. That's
all. You know as much as I do now. It's a young man out
the unknown. She (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) was to have come back Saturday, but put
off till Monday, perhaps on account of--I don't know.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) broke off, and listened to the sounds of a London
morning. Their house was in Wickham Place, and fairly
quiet, for a lofty promontory of buildings separated it from
the main thoroughfare. One had the sense of a backwater, or
rather of an estuary, whose waters flowed in from the
invisible sea, and ebbed into a profound silence while the
waves without were still beating. Though the promontory
consisted of flats--expensive, with cavernous entrance
halls, full of concierges and palms--it fulfilled its
purpose, and gained for the older houses opposite a certain
measure of peace. These, too, would be swept away in time,
and another promontory would rise upon their site, as
humanity piled itself higher and higher on the precious soil
of London.

<p/>Mrs. Munt had her (<font color='blue'><b>Munt</b></font>) own method of interpreting her (<font color='blue'><b>Munt</b></font>)
nieces. She (<font color='blue'><b>Munt</b></font>) decided that Margaret was a little hysterical,
and was trying to gain time by a torrent of talk. Feeling
very diplomatic, she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) lamented the fate of Speyer, and
declared that never, never should she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) be so misguided as to
visit it, and added of her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) own accord that the principles of
restoration were ill understood in Germany. <div class="bookquote">``The Germans,''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``are too thorough, and this is all very well
sometimes, but at other times it does not do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Exactly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>said Margaret; <div class="bookquote">``Germans are too thorough.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>And her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) eyes began to shine.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course I regard you Schlegels as English,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Munt</b></font>)</div>said Mrs.
Munt hastily--<div class="bookquote">``English to the backbone.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Munt</b></font>)</div><p/>Margaret leaned forward and stroked her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And that reminds me--Helen's letter--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes, Aunt Juley, I am thinking all right about
Helen's letter. I know--I must go down and see her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>). I am
thinking about her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) all right. I am meaning to go down''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Munt</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But go with some plan,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Munt</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Munt, admitting into
her (<font color='blue'><b>Munt</b></font>) kindly voice a note of exasperation. <div class="bookquote">``Margaret, if I
may interfere, don't be taken by surprise. What do you
think of the Wilcoxes? Are they our sort? Are they likely
people? Could they appreciate Helen, who is to my mind a
very special sort of person? Do they care about Literature
and Art? That is most important when you come to think of
it. Literature and Art. Most important. How old would the
son be? She (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) says `younger son.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Would he (<font color='blue'><b>Priest</b></font>) be in a position
to marry? Is he (<font color='blue'><b>Priest</b></font>) likely to make Helen happy? Did you gather--''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I gathered nothing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They began to talk at once.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then in that case--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In that case I can make no plans, don't you see.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``On the contrary--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hate plans. I hate lines of action. Helen isn't a baby.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then in that case, my dear, why go down?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div><p/>Margaret was silent. If her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) aunt could not see why she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
must go down, she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) was not going to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) was not
going to say <div class="bookquote">``I love my dear sister; I must be near her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) at
this crisis of her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) life.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>The affections are more reticent
than the passions, and their expression more subtle. If she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
herself should ever fall in love with a man, she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>), like
Helen, would proclaim it from the house-tops, but as she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>)
only loved a sister she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) used the voiceless language of sympathy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I consider you odd girls,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Munt</b></font>)</div>continued Mrs. Munt, <div class="bookquote">``and
very wonderful girls, and in many ways far older than your
years. But--you won't be offended? --frankly I feel you are
not up to this business. It requires an older person.
Dear, I have nothing to call me back to Swanage.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Munt</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Munt</b></font>) spread
out her (<font color='blue'><b>Munt</b></font>) plump arms. <div class="bookquote">``I am all at your disposal. Let me go
down to this house whose name I forget instead of you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Aunt Juley'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--she (<font color='blue'><b>Munt</b></font>) jumped up and kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Munt</b></font>)--<div class="bookquote">``I must,
must go to Howards End myself. You don't exactly
understand, though I can never thank you properly for offering.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do understand,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Munt</b></font>)</div>retorted Mrs. Munt, with immense
confidence. <div class="bookquote">``I go down in no spirit of interference, but to
make inquiries. Inquiries are necessary. Now, I am going
to be rude. You would say the wrong thing; to a certainty
you would. In your anxiety for Helen's happiness you would
offend the whole of these Wilcoxes by asking one of your
impetuous questions--not that one minds offending them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall ask no questions. I have it in Helen's writing
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) and a man are in love. There is no question to ask
as long as she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) keeps to that. All the rest isn't worth a
straw. A long engagement if you like, but inquiries,
questions, plans, lines of action--no, Aunt Juley, no.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Away she (<font color='blue'><b>Munt</b></font>) hurried, not beautiful, not supremely
brilliant, but filled with something that took the place of
both qualities--something best described as a profound
vivacity, a continual and sincere response to all that she (<font color='blue'><b>Munt</b></font>)
encountered in her (<font color='blue'><b>Munt</b></font>) path through life.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If Helen had written the same to me about a
shop-assistant or a penniless clerk--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear Margaret, do come into the library and shut the
door. Your good maids are dusting the banisters.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">''--or if she (<font color='blue'><b>Munt</b></font>) had wanted to marry the man who calls for
Carter Paterson, I should have said the same.''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>Then, with
one of those turns that convinced her (<font color='blue'><b>Munt</b></font>) aunt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Munt</b></font>) was not
mad really and convinced observers of another type that she (<font color='blue'><b>Munt</b></font>)
was not a barren theorist, she (<font color='blue'><b>Munt</b></font>) added: <div class="bookquote">``Though in the case of
Carter Paterson I should want it to be a very long
engagement indeed, I must say.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should think so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Munt</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Munt; <div class="bookquote">``and, indeed, I can
scarcely follow you. Now, just imagine if you said anything
of that sort to the Wilcoxes. I understand it, but most
good people would think you mad. Imagine how disconcerting
for Helen! What is wanted is a person who will go slowly,
slowly in this business, and see how things are and where
they are likely to lead to.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Munt</b></font>)</div><p/>Margaret was down on this.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But you implied just now that the engagement must be
broken off.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think probably it must; but slowly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Can you break an engagement off slowly?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) eyes lit
up. <div class="bookquote">``What's an engagement made of, do you suppose? I think
it's made of some hard stuff, that may snap, but can't
break. It is different to the other ties of life. They
stretch or bend. They admit of degree. They're different.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Exactly so. But won't you let me just run down to
Howards House, and save you all the discomfort? I will
really not interfere, but I do so thoroughly understand the
kind of thing you Schlegels want that one quiet look round
will be enough for me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div><p/>Margaret again thanked her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>), again kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>), and then
ran upstairs to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) brother.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) was not so well.

<p/>The hay fever had worried him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) a good deal all night.
His (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) head ached, his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) eyes were wet, his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) mucous membrane, he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)
informed her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>), was in a most unsatisfactory condition. The
only thing that made life worth living was the thought of
Walter Savage Landor, from whose IMAGINARY CONVERSATIONS she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
had promised to read at frequent intervals during the day.

<p/>It was rather difficult. Something must be done about
Helen. She (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) must be assured that it is not a criminal
offence to love at first sight. A telegram to this effect
would be cold and cryptic, a personal visit seemed each
moment more impossible. Now the doctor arrived, and said
that Tibby was quite bad. Might it really be best to accept
Aunt Juley's kind offer, and to send her (<font color='blue'><b>Juley</b></font>) down to Howards End
with a note?

<p/>Certainly Margaret was impulsive. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) did swing rapidly
from one decision to another. Running downstairs into the
library, she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) cried--<div class="bookquote">``Yes, I have changed my mind; I do wish
that you would go.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>There was a train from King's Cross at eleven. At
half-past ten Tibby, with rare self-effacement, fell asleep,
and Margaret was able to drive her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) aunt to the station.

<p/>``You will remember, Aunt Juley, not to be drawn into
discussing the engagement. Give my letter to Helen, and say
whatever you feel yourself, but do keep clear of the
relatives. We have scarcely got their names straight yet,
and besides, that sort of thing is so uncivilized and wrong.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So uncivilized?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Munt</b></font>)</div>queried Mrs. Munt, fearing that she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
was losing the point of some brilliant remark.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I used an affected word. I only meant would you
please only talk the thing over with Helen.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Only with Helen.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because--''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>But it was no moment to expound the personal
nature of love. Even Margaret shrank from it, and contented
herself with stroking her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) good aunt's hand, and with
meditating, half sensibly and half poetically, on the
journey that was about to begin from King's Cross.

<p/>Like many others who have lived long in a great capital,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) had strong feelings about the various railway termini.
They are our gates to the glorious and the unknown. Through
them we pass out into adventure and sunshine, to them alas!
we return. In Paddington all Cornwall is latent and the
remoter west; down the inclines of Liverpool Street lie
fenlands and the illimitable Broads; Scotland is through the
pylons of Euston; Wessex behind the poised chaos of
Waterloo. Italians realize this, as is natural; those of
them who are so unfortunate as to serve as waiters in Berlin
call the Anhalt Bahnhof the Stazione d``Italia, because by it
they must return to their homes. And he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) is a chilly
Londoner who does not endow his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) stations with some
personality, and extend to them, however shyly, the emotions
of fear and love.

<p/>To Margaret--I hope that it will not set the reader
against her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)--the station of King's Cross had always
suggested Infinity. Its very situation--withdrawn a little
behind the facile splendours of St. Pancras--implied a
comment on the materialism of life. Those two great arches,
colourless, indifferent, shouldering between them an
unlovely clock, were fit portals for some eternal adventure,
whose issue might be prosperous, but would certainly not be
expressed in the ordinary language of prosperity. If you
think this ridiculous, remember that it is not Margaret who
is telling you about it; and let me hasten to add that they
were in plenty of time for the train; that Mrs. Munt, though
she (<font color='blue'><b>Munt</b></font>) took a second-class ticket, was put by the guard into a
first -LRB-only two seconds on the train, one smoking and the
other babies--one cannot be expected to travel with babies-RRB-;
and that Margaret, on her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) return to Wickham Place, was
confronted with the following telegram:

<p/>ALL OVER. WISH I HAD NEVER WRITTEN. TELL NO ONE.
--HELEN

<p/>But Aunt Juley was gone--gone irrevocably, and no power
on earth could stop her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>).


<p/>Chapter 3

<p/>Most complacently did Mrs. Munt rehearse her (<font color='blue'><b>Munt</b></font>) mission. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Munt</b></font>)
nieces were independent young women, and it was not often
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Munt</b></font>) was able to help them. Emily's daughters had never
been quite like other girls. They had been left motherless
when Tibby was born, when Helen was five and Margaret
herself but thirteen. It was before the passing of the
Deceased Wife's Sister Bill, so Mrs. Munt could without
impropriety offer to go and keep house at Wickham Place.
But her (<font color='blue'><b>Munt</b></font>) brother-in-law, who was peculiar and a German, had
referred the question to Margaret, who with the crudity of
youth had answered, <div class="bookquote">``No, they could manage much better
alone.''  (<font color='red'><b>youth</b></font>)</div>Five years later Mr. Schlegel had died too, and Mrs.
Munt had repeated her (<font color='blue'><b>Munt</b></font>) offer. Margaret, crude no longer, had
been grateful and extremely nice, but the substance of her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
answer had been the same. <div class="bookquote">``I must not interfere a third
time,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Munt</b></font>)</div>thought Mrs. Munt. However, of course she (<font color='blue'><b>Munt</b></font>) did. She (<font color='blue'><b>Munt</b></font>)
learnt, to her (<font color='blue'><b>Munt</b></font>) horror, that Margaret, now of age, was taking
her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) money out of the old safe investments and putting it
into Foreign Things, which always smash. Silence would have
been criminal. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) own fortune was invested in Home Rails,
and most ardently did she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) beg her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) niece to imitate her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``Then we should be together, dear.''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>Margaret, out of
politeness, invested a few hundreds in the Nottingham and
Derby Railway, and though the Foreign Things did admirably
and the Nottingham and Derby declined with the steady
dignity of which only Home Rails are capable, Mrs. Munt
never ceased to rejoice, and to say, <div class="bookquote">``I did manage that, at
all events. When the smash comes poor Margaret will have a
nest-egg to fall back upon.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Munt</b></font>)</div>This year Helen came of age,
and exactly the same thing happened in Helen's case; she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>)
also would shift her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) money out of Consols, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>), too,
almost without being pressed, consecrated a fraction of it
to the Nottingham and Derby Railway. So far so good, but in
social matters their aunt had accomplished nothing. Sooner
or later the girls would enter on the process known as
throwing themselves away, and if they had delayed hitherto,
it was only that they might throw themselves more vehemently
in the future. They saw too many people at Wickham
Place--unshaven musicians, an actress even, German cousins
-LRB-one knows what foreigners are-RRB-, acquaintances picked up at
Continental hotels -LRB-one knows what they are too-RRB-. It was
interesting, and down at Swanage no one appreciated culture
more than Mrs. Munt; but it was dangerous, and disaster was
bound to come. How right she (<font color='blue'><b>Munt</b></font>) was, and how lucky to be on
the spot when the disaster came!

<p/>The train sped northward, under innumerable tunnels. It
was only an hour's journey, but Mrs. Munt had to raise and
lower the window again and again. She (<font color='blue'><b>Munt</b></font>) passed through the
South Welwyn Tunnel, saw light for a moment, and entered the
North Welwyn Tunnel, of tragic fame. She (<font color='blue'><b>Munt</b></font>) traversed the
immense viaduct, whose arches span untroubled meadows and
the dreamy flow of Tewin Water. She (<font color='blue'><b>Munt</b></font>) skirted the parks of
politicians. At times the Great North Road accompanied her (<font color='blue'><b>Munt</b></font>),
more suggestive of infinity than any railway, awakening,
after a nap of a hundred years, to such life as is conferred
by the stench of motor-cars, and to such culture as is
implied by the advertisements of antibilious pills. To
history, to tragedy, to the past, to the future, Mrs. Munt
remained equally indifferent; hers but to concentrate on the
end of her (<font color='blue'><b>Munt</b></font>) journey, and to rescue poor Helen from this
dreadful mess.

<p/>The station for Howards End was at Hilton, one of the
large villages that are strung so frequently along the North
Road, and that owe their size to the traffic of coaching and
pre-coaching days. Being near London, it had not shared in
the rural decay, and its long High Street had budded out
right and left into residential estates. For about a mile a
series of tiled and slated houses passed before Mrs. Munt's
inattentive eyes, a series broken at one point by six Danish
tumuli that stood shoulder to shoulder along the highroad,
tombs of soldiers. Beyond these tumuli habitations
thickened, and the train came to a standstill in a tangle
that was almost a town.

<p/>The station, like the scenery, like Helen's letters,
struck an indeterminate note. Into which country will it
lead, England or Suburbia? It was new, it had island
platforms and a subway, and the superficial comfort exacted
by business men. But it held hints of local life, personal
intercourse, as even Mrs. Munt was to discover.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I want a house,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Munt</b></font>) confided to the ticket boy. <div class="bookquote">``Its
name is Howards Lodge. Do you know where it is?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Wilcox!''  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div>the boy called.

<p/>A young man in front of them turned round.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)'s wanting Howards End.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Munt</b></font>)</div><p/>There was nothing for it but to go forward, though Mrs.
Munt was too much agitated even to stare at the stranger.
But remembering that there were two brothers, she (<font color='blue'><b>Munt</b></font>) had the
sense to say to him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``Excuse me asking, but are you the
younger Mr. Wilcox or the elder?''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The younger. Can I do anything for you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, well'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--she (<font color='blue'><b>Munt</b></font>) controlled herself with difficulty.
<div class="bookquote">``Really. Are you? I--''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Munt</b></font>) moved away from the ticket boy
and lowered her (<font color='blue'><b>Munt</b></font>) voice. <div class="bookquote">``I am Miss Schlegels aunt. I ought
to introduce myself, oughtn't I? My name is Mrs. Munt.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Munt</b></font>) was conscious that he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) raised his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) cap and said quite
coolly, <div class="bookquote">``Oh, rather; Miss Schlegel is stopping with us. Did
you want to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Schlegel</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Possibly--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll call you a cab. No; wait a mo--''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) thought.
<div class="bookquote">``Our motor's here. I'll run you up in it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is very kind--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not at all, if you'll just wait till they bring out a
parcel from the office. This way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My niece is not with you by any chance?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; I came over with my father. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) has gone on north
in your train. You'll see Miss Schlegel at lunch. You're
coming up to lunch, I hope?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should like to come UP,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Munt</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Munt, not
committing herself to nourishment until she (<font color='blue'><b>Munt</b></font>) had studied
Helen's lover a little more. He (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) seemed a gentleman, but had
so rattled her (<font color='blue'><b>Munt</b></font>) round that her (<font color='blue'><b>Munt</b></font>) powers of observation were
numbed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Munt</b></font>) glanced at him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) stealthily. To a feminine eye
there was nothing amiss in the sharp depressions at the
corners of his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) mouth, nor in the rather box-like
construction of his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) forehead. He (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) was dark, clean-shaven and
seemed accustomed to command.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``In front or behind? Which do you prefer? It may be
windy in front.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In front if I may; then we can talk.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But excuse me one moment--I can't think what they're
doing with that parcel.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) strode into the booking-office
and called with a new voice: <div class="bookquote">``Hi! hi, you there! Are you
going to keep me waiting all day? Parcel for Wilcox,
Howards End. Just look sharp!''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>Emerging, he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) said in
quieter tones: <div class="bookquote">``This station's abominably organized; if I
had my way, the whole lot of 'em should get the sack. May I
help you in?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``This is very good of you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Munt</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Munt, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Munt</b></font>)
settled herself into a luxurious cavern of red leather, and
suffered her (<font color='blue'><b>Munt</b></font>) person to be padded with rugs and shawls. She (<font color='blue'><b>Munt</b></font>)
was more civil than she (<font color='blue'><b>Munt</b></font>) had intended, but really this young
man was very kind. Moreover, she (<font color='blue'><b>Munt</b></font>) was a little afraid of
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>): his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) self-possession was extraordinary. <div class="bookquote">``Very good
indeed,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Munt</b></font>) repeated, adding: <div class="bookquote">``It is just what I should
have wished.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very good of you to say so,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) replied, with a slight
look of surprise, which, like most slight looks, escaped
Mrs. Munt's attention. <div class="bookquote">``I was just tooling my father over
to catch the down train.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You see, we heard from Helen this morning.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Young</b></font>)</div><p/>Young Wilcox was pouring in petrol, starting his (<font color='blue'><b>Young</b></font>) engine,
and performing other actions with which this story has no
concern. The great car began to rock, and the form of Mrs.
Munt, trying to explain things, sprang agreeably up and down
among the red cushions. <div class="bookquote">``The mater will be very glad to see
you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Young</b></font>) mumbled. <div class="bookquote">``Hi! I say. Parcel for Howards End.
Bring it out. Hi!''

 (<font color='red'><b>A porter</b></font>)</div><p/>A bearded porter emerged with the parcel in one hand and
an entry book in the other. With the gathering whir of the
motor these ejaculations mingled: <div class="bookquote">``Sign, must I? Why
the--should I sign after all this bother? Not even got a
pencil on you? Remember next time I report you to the
station-master. My time's of value, though yours mayn't
be. Here'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--here being a tip.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Extremely sorry, Mrs. Munt.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not at all, Mr. Wilcox.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And do you object to going through the village? It is
rather a longer spin, but I have one or two commissions.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should love going through the village. Naturally I
am very anxious to talk things over with you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>As she (<font color='blue'><b>Munt</b></font>) said this she (<font color='blue'><b>Munt</b></font>) felt ashamed, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Munt</b></font>) was
disobeying Margaret's instructions. Only disobeying them in
the letter, surely. Margaret had only warned her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) against
discussing the incident with outsiders. Surely it was not
<div class="bookquote">``uncivilized or wrong''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>to discuss it with the young man
himself, since chance had thrown them together.

<p/>A reticent fellow, he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) made no reply. Mounting by her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
side, he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) put on gloves and spectacles, and off they drove,
the bearded porter--life is a mysterious business--looking
after them with admiration.

<p/>The wind was in their faces down the station road,
blowing the dust into Mrs. Munt's eyes. But as soon as they
turned into the Great North Road she (<font color='blue'><b>Munt</b></font>) opened fire. <div class="bookquote">``You can
well imagine,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Munt</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``that the news was a great shock to
us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What news?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Wilcox,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Munt</b></font>) said frankly. <div class="bookquote">``Margaret has told me
everything--everything. I have seen Helen's letter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) could not look her (<font color='blue'><b>Munt</b></font>) in the face, as his (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) eyes were
fixed on his (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) work; he (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) was travelling as quickly as he (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) dared
down the High Street. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) inclined his (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) head in her (<font color='blue'><b>Munt</b></font>)
direction, and said, <div class="bookquote">``I beg your pardon; I didn't catch.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``About Helen. Helen, of course. Helen is a very
exceptional person--I am sure you will let me say this,
feeling towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) as you do--indeed, all the Schlegels are
exceptional. I come in no spirit of interference, but it
was a great shock.''

 (<font color='red'><b>a draper</b></font>)</div><p/>They drew up opposite a draper's. Without replying, he (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>)
turned round in his (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) seat, and contemplated the cloud of dust
that they had raised in their passage through the village.
It was settling again, but not all into the road from which
he (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) had taken it. Some of it had percolated through the open
windows, some had whitened the roses and gooseberries of the
wayside gardens, while a certain proportion had entered the
lungs of the villagers. <div class="bookquote">``I wonder when they'll learn wisdom
and tar the roads,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was his (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) comment. Then a man ran out of
the draper's with a roll of oilcloth, and off they went again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Margaret could not come herself, on account of poor
Tibby, so I am here to represent her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) and to have a good talk.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm sorry to be so dense,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the young man, again
drawing up outside a shop. <div class="bookquote">``But I still haven't quite understood.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Helen, Mr. Wilcox--my niece and you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pushed up his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) goggles and gazed at her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>), absolutely
bewildered. Horror smote her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) to the heart, for even she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)
began to suspect that they were at cross-purposes, and that
she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) had commenced her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) mission by some hideous blunder.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Schlegel and myself.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) asked, compressing his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lips.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I trust there has been no misunderstanding,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Munt</b></font>)</div>quavered
Mrs. Munt. <div class="bookquote">``Her (<font color='blue'><b>Schlegel</b></font>) letter certainly read that way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What way?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That you and she (<font color='blue'><b>Schlegel</b></font>)--''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Munt</b></font>) paused, then drooped her (<font color='blue'><b>Munt</b></font>) eyelids.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think I catch your meaning,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said stickily. <div class="bookquote">``What
an extraordinary mistake!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then you didn't the least--''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Munt</b></font>) stammered, getting
blood-red in the face, and wishing she (<font color='blue'><b>Munt</b></font>) had never been born.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Scarcely, as I am already engaged to another lady.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>There was a moment's silence, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) caught his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) breath
and exploded with, <div class="bookquote">``Oh, good God! Don't tell me it's some
silliness of Paul's.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you are Paul.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then why did you say so at the station?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I said nothing of the sort.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I beg your pardon, you did.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I beg your pardon, I did not. My name is Charles.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Younger''  (<font color='red'><b>son</b></font>)</div>may mean son as opposed to father, or second
brother as opposed to first. There is much to be said for
either view, and later on they said it. But they had other
questions before them now.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you mean to tell me that Paul--''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Munt</b></font>) did not like his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) voice. He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) sounded as if he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) was
talking to a porter, and, certain that he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) had deceived her (<font color='blue'><b>Munt</b></font>)
at the station, she (<font color='blue'><b>Munt</b></font>) too grew angry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you mean to tell me that Paul and your niece--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Munt</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Munt--such is human nature--determined that she (<font color='blue'><b>Munt</b></font>)
would champion the lovers. She (<font color='blue'><b>Munt</b></font>) was not going to be bullied
by a severe young man. <div class="bookquote">``Yes, they care for one another very
much indeed,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Munt</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I dare say they will tell you
about it by-and-by. We heard this morning.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charles/Wilcox/Charles Wilcox</b></font>)</div><p/>And Charles clenched his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) fist and cried, <div class="bookquote">``The idiot, the
idiot, the little fool!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charles/Wilcox/Charles Wilcox</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Munt tried to divest herself of her (<font color='blue'><b>Munt</b></font>) rugs. <div class="bookquote">``If that
is your attitude, Mr. Wilcox, I prefer to walk.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I beg you will do no such thing. I'll take you up this
moment to the house. Let me tell you the thing's
impossible, and must be stopped.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Munt</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Munt did not often lose her (<font color='blue'><b>Munt</b></font>) temper, and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Munt</b></font>)
did it was only to protect those whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Munt</b></font>) loved. On this
occasion she (<font color='blue'><b>Munt</b></font>) blazed out. <div class="bookquote">``I quite agree, sir. The thing is
impossible, and I will come up and stop it. My niece is a
very exceptional person, and I am not inclined to sit still
while she (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) throws herself away on those who will not
appreciate her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charles/Wilcox/Charles Wilcox</b></font>)</div><p/>Charles worked his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) jaws.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Considering she (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) has only known your brother since
Wednesday, and only met your father and mother at a stray hotel--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Could you possibly lower your voice? The shopman will overhear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Esprit de classe'' (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Munt</b></font>)</div>--if one may coin the phrase--was
strong in Mrs. Munt. She (<font color='blue'><b>Munt</b></font>) sat quivering while a member of
the lower orders deposited a metal funnel, a saucepan, and a
garden squirt beside the roll of oilcloth.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Right behind?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>And the lower orders vanished in a cloud of dust.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I warn you: Paul hasn't a penny; it's useless.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No need to warn us, Mr. Wilcox, I assure you. The
warning is all the other way. My niece has been very
foolish, and I shall give her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) a good scolding and take her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>)
back to London with me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) has to make his (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) way out in Nigeria. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) couldn't
think of marrying for years and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) does it must be a
woman who can stand the climate, and is in other ways--Why
hasn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) told us? Of course he (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>)'s ashamed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) knows he (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>)'s
been a fool. And so he (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) has--a damned fool.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Munt</b></font>) grew furious.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Whereas Miss Schlegel has lost no time in publishing
the news.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If I were a man, Mr. Wilcox, for that last remark I'd
box your ears. You're not fit to clean my niece's boots, to
sit in the same room with her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>), and you dare--you actually
dare--I decline to argue with such a person.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``All I know is, she (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>)'s spread the thing and he (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) hasn't,
and my father's away and I--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And all that I know is--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Might I finish my sentence, please?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charles/Wilcox/Charles Wilcox</b></font>)</div><p/>Charles clenched his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) teeth and sent the motor swerving
all over the lane.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Munt</b></font>) screamed.

<p/>So they played the game of Capping Families, a round of
which is always played when love would unite two members of
our race. But they played it with unusual vigour, stating
in so many words that Schlegels were better than Wilcoxes,
Wilcoxes better than Schlegels. They flung decency aside.
The man was young, the woman deeply stirred; in both a vein
of coarseness was latent. Their quarrel was no more
surprising than are most quarrels--inevitable at the time,
incredible afterwards. But it was more than usually
futile. A few minutes, and they were enlightened. The
motor drew up at Howards End, and Helen, looking very pale,
ran out to meet her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) aunt.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Aunt Juley, I have just had a telegram from Margaret;
I--I meant to stop your coming. It isn't--it's over.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Munt</b></font>)</div><p/>The climax was too much for Mrs. Munt. She (<font color='blue'><b>Munt</b></font>) burst into tears.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Aunt Juley dear, don't. Don't let them know I've been
so silly. It wasn't anything. Do bear up for my sake.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Paul,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charles/Wilcox/Charles Wilcox</b></font>)</div>cried Charles Wilcox, pulling his (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) gloves off.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't let them know. They are never to know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, my darling Helen--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Paul! Paul!''

 (<font color='red'><b>A man</b></font>)</div><p/>A very young man came out of the house.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Paul, is there any truth in this?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I didn't--I don't--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes or no, man; plain question, plain answer. Did or
didn't Miss Schlegel--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Charles dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said a voice from the garden. <div class="bookquote">``Charles,
dear Charles, one doesn't ask plain questions. There aren't
such things.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They were all silent. It was Mrs. Wilcox.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) approached just as Helen's letter had described her (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>),
trailing noiselessly over the lawn, and there was actually a
wisp of hay in her (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) hands. She (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) seemed to belong not to the
young people and their motor, but to the house, and to the
tree that overshadowed it. One knew that she (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) worshipped the
past, and that the instinctive wisdom the past can alone
bestow had descended upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>)--that wisdom to which we give
the clumsy name of aristocracy. High born she (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) might not
be. But assuredly she (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) cared about her (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) ancestors, and let
them help her (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>). When she (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) saw Charles angry, Paul frightened,
and Mrs. Munt in tears, she (<font color='blue'><b>Munt</b></font>) heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Munt</b></font>) ancestors say,
<div class="bookquote">``Separate those human beings who will hurt each other most.
The rest can wait.''  (<font color='red'><b>ancestors</b></font>)</div>So she (<font color='blue'><b>Munt</b></font>) did not ask questions. Still
less did she (<font color='blue'><b>Munt</b></font>) pretend that nothing had happened, as a
competent society hostess would have done. She (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Miss
Schlegel, would you take your aunt up to your room or to my
room, whichever you think best. Paul, do find Evie, and
tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Evie</b></font>) lunch for six, but I'm not sure whether we shall
all be downstairs for it.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>And when they had obeyed her (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>)
turned to her (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>) elder son, who still stood in the throbbing
stinking car, and smiled at him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) with tenderness, and without
a word, turned away from him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) towards her (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>) flowers.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) called, <div class="bookquote">``are you aware that Paul has been
playing the fool again?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's all right, dear. They have broken off the engagement.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Engagement--!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They do not love any longer, if you prefer it put that
way,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Wilcox/Mrs. Warrington/Wilcox</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Wilcox, stooping down to smell a rose.


<p/>Chapter 4

<p/>Helen and her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) aunt returned to Wickham Place in a state of
collapse, and for a little time Margaret had three invalids
on her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) hands. Mrs. Munt soon recovered. She (<font color='blue'><b>Munt</b></font>) possessed to a
remarkable degree the power of distorting the past, and
before many days were over she (<font color='blue'><b>Munt</b></font>) had forgotten the part played
by her (<font color='blue'><b>Munt</b></font>) own imprudence in the catastrophe. Even at the
crisis she (<font color='blue'><b>Munt</b></font>) had cried, <div class="bookquote">``Thank goodness, poor Margaret is
saved this!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>which during the journey to London evolved
into, <div class="bookquote">``It had to be gone through by someone,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>which in its
turn ripened into the permanent form of <div class="bookquote">``The one time I
really did help Emily's girls was over the Wilcox
business.''  (<font color='red'><b>Helen</b></font>)</div>But Helen was a more serious patient. New ideas
had burst upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) like a thunder clap, and by them and by
her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) reverberations she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) had been stunned.

<p/>The truth was that she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) had fallen in love, not with an
individual, but with a family.

<p/>Before Paul arrived she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) had, as it were, been tuned up
into his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) key. The energy of the Wilcoxes had fascinated
her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>), had created new images of beauty in her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) responsive
mind. To be all day with them in the open air, to sleep at
night under their roof, had seemed the supreme joy of life,
and had led to that abandonment of personality that is a
possible prelude to love. She (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) had liked giving in to Mr.
Wilcox, or Evie, or Charles; she (<font color='blue'><b>Evie</b></font>) had liked being told that
her (<font color='blue'><b>Evie</b></font>) notions of life were sheltered or academic; that
Equality was nonsense, Votes for Women nonsense, Socialism
nonsense, Art and Literature, except when conducive to
strengthening the character, nonsense. One by one the
Schlegel fetiches had been overthrown, and, though
professing to defend them, she (<font color='blue'><b>Schlegel</b></font>) had rejoiced. When Mr.
Wilcox said that one sound man of business did more good to
the world than a dozen of your social reformers, she (<font color='blue'><b>Schlegel</b></font>) had
swallowed the curious assertion without a gasp, and had
leant back luxuriously among the cushions of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) motor-car.
When Charles said, <div class="bookquote">``Why be so polite to servants? they
don't understand it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charles/Wilcox/Charles Wilcox</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Schlegel</b></font>) had not given the Schlegel retort
of, <div class="bookquote">``If they don't understand it, I do.''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Schlegel/Schlegel</b></font>)</div>No; she (<font color='blue'><b>Schlegel</b></font>) had vowed
to be less polite to servants in the future. <div class="bookquote">``I am swathed
in cant,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Schlegel</b></font>) thought, <div class="bookquote">``and it is good for me to be stripped
of it.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And all that she (<font color='blue'><b>Schlegel</b></font>) thought or did or breathed was a
quiet preparation for Paul. Paul was inevitable. Charles
was taken up with another girl, Mr. Wilcox was so old, Evie
so young, Mrs. Wilcox so different. Round the absent
brother she (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) began to throw the halo of Romance, to irradiate
him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) with all the splendour of those happy days, to feel that
in him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) should draw nearest to the robust ideal. He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) were about the same age, Evie said. Most people thought
Paul handsomer than his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) brother. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was certainly a better
shot, though not so good at golf. And when Paul appeared,
flushed with the triumph of getting through an examination,
and ready to flirt with any pretty girl, Helen met him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
halfway, or more than halfway, and turned towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) on the
Sunday evening.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) had been talking of his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) approaching exile in Nigeria,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) should have continued to talk of it, and allowed
their guest to recover. But the heave of her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) bosom
flattered him (<font color='blue'><b>guest</b></font>). Passion was possible, and he (<font color='blue'><b>guest</b></font>) became
passionate. Deep down in him (<font color='blue'><b>guest</b></font>) something whispered, <div class="bookquote">``This
girl would let you kiss her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>); you might not have such a
chance again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>That was <div class="bookquote">``how it happened,''  (<font color='red'><b>Helen</b></font>)</div>or, rather, how Helen
described it to her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) sister, using words even more
unsympathetic than my own. But the poetry of that kiss, the
wonder of it, the magic that there was in life for hours
after it--who can describe that? It is so easy for an
Englishman to sneer at these chance collisions of human
beings. To the insular cynic and the insular moralist they
offer an equal opportunity. It is so easy to talk of
<div class="bookquote">``passing emotion,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>and how to forget how vivid the emotion
was ere it passed. Our impulse to sneer, to forget, is at
root a good one. We recognize that emotion is not enough,
and that men and women are personalities capable of
sustained relations, not mere opportunities for an
electrical discharge. Yet we rate the impulse too highly.
We do not admit that by collisions of this trivial sort the
doors of heaven may be shaken open. To Helen, at all
events, her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) life was to bring nothing more intense than the
embrace of this boy who played no part in it. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had drawn
her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) out of the house, where there was danger of surprise and
light; he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had led her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) by a path he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) knew, until they stood
under the column of the vast wych-elm. A man in the
darkness, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had whispered <div class="bookquote">``I love you''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>when she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) was
desiring love. In time his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) slender personality faded, the
scene that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had evoked endured. In all the variable years
that followed she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) never saw the like of it again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I understand,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>said Margaret--<div class="bookquote">``at least, I understand
as much as ever is understood of these things. Tell me now
what happened on the Monday morning.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It was over at once.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How, Helen?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I was still happy while I dressed, but as I came
downstairs I got nervous, and when I went into the
dining-room I knew it was no good. There was Evie--I can't
explain--managing the tea-urn, and Mr. Wilcox reading the
TIMES.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Was Paul there?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; and Charles was talking to him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) about Stocks and
Shares, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) looked frightened.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the sisters</b></font>)</div><p/>By slight indications the sisters could convey much to
each other. Margaret saw horror latent in the scene, and
Helen's next remark did not surprise her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Somehow, when that kind of man looks frightened it is
too awful. It is all right for us to be frightened, or for
men of another sort--father, for instance; but for men like
that! When I saw all the others so placid, and Paul mad
with terror in case I said the wrong thing, I felt for a
moment that the whole Wilcox family was a fraud, just a wall
of newspapers and motor-cars and golf-clubs, and that if it
fell I should find nothing behind it but panic and
emptiness. ''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think that. The Wilcoxes struck me as being
genuine people, particularly the wife.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``No, I don't really think that. But Paul was so
broad-shouldered; all kinds of extraordinary things made it
worse, and I knew that it would never do--never. I said to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) after breakfast, when the others were practising
strokes, ``We rather lost our heads,'' and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) looked better at
once, though frightfully ashamed. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) began a speech about
having no money to marry on, but it hurt him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to make it, and
I--stopped him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). Then he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said, ``I must beg your pardon over
this, Miss Schlegel; I can't think what came over me last
night.'' And I said, ``Nor what over me; never mind.<div class="bookquote">'' And then
we parted--at least, until I remembered that I had written
straight off to tell you the night before, and that
frightened him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) again. I asked him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to send a telegram for
me, for he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knew you would be coming or something; and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
tried to get hold of the motor, but Charles and Mr. Wilcox
wanted it to go to the station; and Charles offered to send
the telegram for me, and then I had to say that the telegram
was of no consequence, for Paul said Charles might read it,
and though I wrote it out several times, he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) always said
people would suspect something. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) took it himself at last,
pretending that he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) must walk down to get cartridges, and,
what with one thing and the other, it was not handed in at
the Post Office until too late. It was the most terrible
morning. Paul disliked me more and more, and Evie talked
cricket averages till I nearly screamed. I cannot think how
I stood her (<font color='blue'><b>Evie</b></font>) all the other days. At last Charles and his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
father started for the station, and then came your telegram
warning me that Aunt Juley was coming by that train, and
Paul--oh, rather horrible--said that I had muddled it. But
Mrs. Wilcox knew.''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Knew what?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Everything; though we neither of us told her (<font color='blue'><b>Schlegel</b></font>) a word,
and had known all along, I think.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, she (<font color='blue'><b>Schlegel</b></font>) must have overheard you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose so, but it seemed wonderful. When Charles and
Aunt Juley drove up, calling each other names, Mrs. Wilcox
stepped in from the garden and made everything less
terrible. Ugh! but it has been a disgusting business. To
think that--''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) sighed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``To think that because you and a young man meet for a
moment, there must be all these telegrams and anger,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>supplied Margaret.

<p/>Helen nodded.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've often thought about it, Helen. It's one of the
most interesting things in the world. The truth is that
there is a great outer life that you and I have never
touched--a life in which telegrams and anger count.
Personal relations, that we think supreme, are not supreme
there. There love means marriage settlements, death, death
duties. So far I'm clear. But here my difficulty. This
outer life, though obviously horrid, often seems the real
one--there's grit in it. It does breed character. Do
personal relations lead to sloppiness in the end?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Meg, that's what I felt, only not so clearly, when
the Wilcoxes were so competent, and seemed to have their
hands on all the ropes. ''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't you feel it now?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I remember Paul at breakfast,''  (<font color='red'><b>Helen</b></font>)</div>said Helen quietly. ``I
shall never forget him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) had nothing to fall back upon.
I know that personal relations are the real life, for ever
and ever.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Amen!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charles/Wilcox/Charles Wilcox</b></font>)</div><p/>So the Wilcox episode fell into the background, leaving
behind it memories of sweetness and horror that mingled, and
the sisters pursued the life that Helen had commended. They
talked to each other and to other people, they filled the
tall thin house at Wickham Place with those whom they liked
or could befriend. They even attended public meetings. In
their own fashion they cared deeply about politics, though
not as politicians would have us care; they desired that
public life should mirror whatever is good in the life
within. Temperance, tolerance, and sexual equality were
intelligible cries to them; whereas they did not follow our
Forward Policy in Thibet with the keen attention that it
merits, and would at times dismiss the whole British Empire
with a puzzled, if reverent, sigh. Not out of them are the
shows of history erected: the world would be a grey,
bloodless place were it entirely composed of Miss
Schlegels. But the world being what it is, perhaps they
shine out in it like stars.

<p/>A word on their origin. They were not <div class="bookquote">``English to the
backbone,''  (<font color='red'><b>aunt</b></font>)</div>as their aunt had piously asserted. But, on the
other band, they were not <div class="bookquote">``Germans of the dreadful sort.''
 (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>Their father had belonged to a type that was more prominent
in Germany fifty years ago than now. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was not the
aggressive German, so dear to the English journalist, nor
the domestic German, so dear to the English wit. If one
classed him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) at all it would be as the countryman of Hegel
and Kant, as the idealist, inclined to be dreamy, whose
Imperialism was the Imperialism of the air. Not that his (<font color='blue'><b>Kant</b></font>)
life had been inactive. He (<font color='blue'><b>Kant</b></font>) had fought like blazes against
Denmark, Austria, France. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Kant</b></font>) had fought without
visualizing the results of victory. A hint of the truth
broke on him (<font color='blue'><b>Kant</b></font>) after Sedan, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Kant</b></font>) saw the dyed moustaches of
Napoleon going grey; another when he (<font color='blue'><b>Napoleon</b></font>) entered Paris, and saw
the smashed windows of the Tuileries. Peace came--it was
all very immense, one had turned into an Empire--but he (<font color='blue'><b>Napoleon</b></font>) knew
that some quality had vanished for which not all
Alsace-Lorraine could compensate him (<font color='blue'><b>Napoleon</b></font>). Germany a commercial
Power, Germany a naval Power, Germany with colonies here and
a Forward Policy there, and legitimate aspirations in the
other place, might appeal to others, and be fitly served by
them; for his (<font color='blue'><b>Napoleon</b></font>) own part, he (<font color='blue'><b>Napoleon</b></font>) abstained from the fruits of
victory, and naturalized himself in England. The more
earnest members of his (<font color='blue'><b>Napoleon</b></font>) family never forgave him (<font color='blue'><b>Napoleon</b></font>), and knew
that his (<font color='blue'><b>Napoleon</b></font>) children, though scarcely English of the dreadful
sort, would never be German to the backbone. He (<font color='blue'><b>Napoleon</b></font>) had
obtained work in one of our provincial Universities, and
there married Poor Emily -LRB-or Die Englanderin as the case may
be-RRB-, and as she (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>) had money, they proceeded to London, and
came to know a good many people. But his (<font color='blue'><b>Napoleon</b></font>) gaze was always
fixed beyond the sea. It was his (<font color='blue'><b>Napoleon</b></font>) hope that the clouds of
materialism obscuring the Fatherland would part in time, and
the mild intellectual light re-emerge. <div class="bookquote">``Do you imply that
we Germans are stupid, Uncle Ernst?''  (<font color='red'><b>a nephew</b></font>)</div>exclaimed a haughty and
magnificent nephew. Uncle Ernst replied, <div class="bookquote">``To my mind. You
use the intellect, but you no longer care about it. That I
call stupidity.''  (<font color='red'><b>Uncle Ernst</b></font>)</div>As the haughty nephew did not follow, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ernst</b></font>)
continued, <div class="bookquote">``You only care about the' things that you can
use, and therefore arrange them in the following order:
Money, supremely useful; intellect, rather useful;
imagination, of no use at all. No'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--for the other had
protested--<div class="bookquote">``your Pan-Germanism is no more imaginative than
is our Imperialism over here. It is the vice of a vulgar
mind to be thrilled by bigness, to think that a thousand
square miles are a thousand times more wonderful than one
square mile, and that a million square miles are almost the
same as heaven. That is not imagination. No, it kills it.
When their poets over here try to celebrate bigness they are
dead at once, and naturally. Your poets too are dying, your
philosophers, your musicians, to whom Europe has listened
for two hundred years. Gone. Gone with the little courts
that nurtured them--gone with Esterhaz and Weimar. What?
What's that? Your Universities? Oh, yes, you have learned
men, who collect more facts than do the learned men of
England. They collect facts, and facts, and empires of
facts. But which of them will rekindle the light within?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div><p/>To all this Margaret listened, sitting on the haughty
nephew's knee.

<p/>It was a unique education for the little girls. The
haughty nephew would be at Wickham Place one day, bringing
with him (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) an even haughtier wife, both convinced that Germany
was appointed by God to govern the world. Aunt Juley would
come the next day, convinced that Great Britain had been
appointed to the same post by the same authority. Were both
these loud-voiced parties right? On one occasion they had
met, and Margaret with clasped hands had implored them to
argue the subject out in her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) presence. Whereat they
blushed, and began to talk about the weather. <div class="bookquote">``Papa''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
cried--she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) was a most offensive child--<div class="bookquote">``why will they not
discuss this most clear question?''  (<font color='red'><b>a child</b></font>)</div>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) father, surveying
the parties grimly, replied that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) did not know. Putting
her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) head on one side, Margaret then remarked, <div class="bookquote">``To me one of
two things is very clear; either God does not know his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) own
mind about England and Germany, or else these do not know
the mind of God.''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>A hateful little girl, but at thirteen she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
had grasped a dilemma that most people travel through life
without perceiving. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) brain darted up and down; it grew
pliant and strong. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) conclusion was, that any human being
lies nearer to the unseen than any organization, and from
this she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) never varied.

<p/>Helen advanced along the same lines, though with a more
irresponsible tread. In character she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) resembled her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) sister,
but she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) was pretty, and so apt to have a more amusing time.
People gathered round her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) more readily, especially when they
were new acquaintances, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) did enjoy a little homage
very much. When their father died and they ruled alone at
Wickham Place, she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) often absorbed the whole of the company,
while Margaret--both were tremendous talkers--fell flat.
Neither sister bothered about this. Helen never apologized
afterwards, Margaret did not feel the slightest rancour.
But looks have their influence upon character. The sisters
were alike as little girls, but at the time of the Wilcox
episode their methods were beginning to diverge; the younger
was rather apt to entice people, and, in enticing them, to
be herself enticed; the elder went straight ahead, and
accepted an occasional failure as part of the game.

<p/>Little need be premised about Tibby. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) was now an
intelligent man of sixteen, but dyspeptic and difficile.


<p/>Chapter 5

<p/>It will be generally admitted that Beethoven's Fifth
Symphony is the most sublime noise that has ever penetrated
into the ear of man. All sorts and conditions are satisfied
by it. Whether you are like Mrs. Munt, and tap
surreptitiously when the tunes come--of course, not so as to
disturb the others--; or like Helen, who can see heroes and
shipwrecks in the music's flood; or like Margaret, who can
only see the music; or like Tibby, who is profoundly versed
in counterpoint, and holds the full score open on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knee;
or like their cousin, Fraulein Mosebach, who remembers all
the time that Beethoven is <div class="bookquote">``echt Deutsch'' (<font color='red'><b>Beethoven</b></font>)</div>; or like Fraulein
Mosebach's young man, who can remember nothing but Fraulein
Mosebach: in any case, the passion of your life becomes more
vivid, and you are bound to admit that such a noise is cheap
at two shillings. It is cheap, even if you hear it in the
Queen's Hall, dreariest music-room in London, though not as
dreary as the Free Trade Hall, Manchester; and even if you
sit on the extreme left of that hall, so that the brass
bumps at you before the rest of the orchestra arrives, it is
still cheap.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who is Margaret talking to?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Munt</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Munt, at the
conclusion of the first movement. She (<font color='blue'><b>Munt</b></font>) was again in London
on a visit to Wickham Place.

<p/>Helen looked down the long line of their party, and said
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) did not know.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Would it be some young man or other whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) takes an
interest in?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I expect so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Helen</b></font>)</div>Helen replied. Music enwrapped her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>), and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) could not enter into the distinction that divides young
men whom one takes an interest in from young men whom one knows.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You girls are so wonderful in always having--Oh dear!
one mustn't talk.''

 (<font color='red'><b>family</b></font>)</div><p/>For the Andante had begun--very beautiful, but bearing a
family likeness to all the other beautiful Andantes that
Beethoven had written, and, to Helen's mind, rather
disconnecting the heroes and shipwrecks of the first
movement from the heroes and goblins of the third. She (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>)
heard the tune through once, and then her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) attention
wandered, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) gazed at the audience, or the organ, or
the architecture. Much did she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) censure the attenuated
Cupids who encircle the ceiling of the Queen's Hall,
inclining each to each with vapid gesture, and clad in
sallow pantaloons, on which the October sunlight struck.
<div class="bookquote">``How awful to marry a man like those Cupids!''  (<font color='red'><b>Helen</b></font>)</div>thought
Helen. Here Beethoven started decorating his (<font color='blue'><b>Beethoven</b></font>) tune, so she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>)
heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Beethoven</b></font>) through once more, and then she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) smiled at her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>)
cousin Frieda. But Frieda, listening to Classical Music,
could not respond. Herr Liesecke, too, looked as if wild
horses could not make him (<font color='blue'><b>Liesecke</b></font>) inattentive; there were lines
across his (<font color='blue'><b>Liesecke</b></font>) forehead, his (<font color='blue'><b>Liesecke</b></font>) lips were parted, his (<font color='blue'><b>Liesecke</b></font>) pince-nez at
right angles to his (<font color='blue'><b>Liesecke</b></font>) nose, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Liesecke</b></font>) had laid a thick, white
hand on either knee. And next to her (<font color='blue'><b>Frieda</b></font>) was Aunt Juley, so
British, and wanting to tap. How interesting that row of
people was! What diverse influences had gone to the
making! Here Beethoven, after humming and hawing with great
sweetness, said <div class="bookquote">``Heigho,''  (<font color='red'><b>Beethoven</b></font>)</div>and the Andante came to an end.
Applause, and a round of <div class="bookquote">``wunderschoning''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>and
<div class="bookquote">``prachtvolleying''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>from the German contingent. Margaret
started talking to her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) new young man; Helen said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>)
aunt: <div class="bookquote">``Now comes the wonderful movement: first of all the
goblins, and then a trio of elephants dancing;''  (<font color='red'><b>aunt</b></font>)</div>and Tibby
implored the company generally to look out for the
transitional passage on the drum.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``On the what, dear?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``On the DRUM, Aunt Juley.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; look out for the part where you think you have done
with the goblins and they come back,''  (<font color='red'><b>Helen</b></font>)</div>breathed Helen, as the
music started with a goblin walking quietly over the
universe, from end to end. Others followed him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). They were
not aggressive creatures; it was that that made them so
terrible to Helen. They merely observed in passing that
there was no such thing as splendour or heroism in the
world. After the interlude of elephants dancing, they
returned and made the observation for the second time.
Helen could not contradict them, for, once at all events,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) had felt the same, and had seen the reliable walls of
youth collapse. Panic and emptiness! Panic and emptiness!
The goblins were right.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) brother raised his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) finger: it was the transitional
passage on the drum.

<p/>For, as if things were going too far, Beethoven took
hold of the goblins and made them do what he (<font color='blue'><b>Beethoven</b></font>) wanted. He (<font color='blue'><b>Beethoven</b></font>)
appeared in person. He (<font color='blue'><b>Beethoven</b></font>) gave them a little push, and they
began to walk in major key instead of in a minor, and
then--he (<font color='blue'><b>Beethoven</b></font>) blew with his (<font color='blue'><b>Beethoven</b></font>) mouth and they were scattered! Gusts
of splendour, gods and demigods contending with vast swords,
colour and fragrance broadcast on the field of battle,
magnificent victory, magnificent death! Oh, it all burst
before the girl, and she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) even stretched out her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) gloved hands
as if it was tangible. Any fate was titanic; any contest
desirable; conqueror and conquered would alike be applauded
by the angels of the utmost stars.

<p/>And the goblins--they had not really been there at all?
They were only the phantoms of cowardice and unbelief? One
healthy human impulse would dispel them? Men like the
Wilcoxes, or President Roosevelt, would say yes. Beethoven
knew better. The goblins really had been there. They might
return--and they did. It was as if the splendour of life
might boil over--and waste to steam and froth. In its
dissolution one heard the terrible, ominous note, and a
goblin, with increased malignity, walked quietly over the
universe from end to end. Panic and emptiness! Panic and
emptiness! Even the flaming ramparts of the world might fall.

<p/>Beethoven chose to make all right in the end. He (<font color='blue'><b>Beethoven</b></font>) built
the ramparts up. He (<font color='blue'><b>Beethoven</b></font>) blew with his (<font color='blue'><b>Beethoven</b></font>) mouth for the second time,
and again the goblins were scattered. He (<font color='blue'><b>Beethoven</b></font>) brought back the
gusts of splendour, the heroism, the youth, the magnificence
of life and of death, and, amid vast roarings of a
superhuman joy, he (<font color='blue'><b>Beethoven</b></font>) led his (<font color='blue'><b>Beethoven</b></font>) Fifth Symphony to its
conclusion. But the goblins were there. They could
return. He (<font color='blue'><b>Beethoven</b></font>) had said so bravely, and that is why one can
trust Beethoven when he (<font color='blue'><b>Beethoven</b></font>) says other things.

<p/>Helen pushed her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) way out during the applause. She (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>)
desired to be alone. The music summed up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) all that
had happened or could happen in her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) career. She (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) read it as
a tangible statement, which could never be superseded. The
notes meant this and that to her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>), and they could have no
other meaning, and life could have no other meaning. She (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>)
pushed right out of the building, and walked slowly down the
outside staircase, breathing the autumnal air, and then she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>)
strolled home.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Margaret,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Munt</b></font>)</div>called Mrs. Munt, <div class="bookquote">``is Helen all right?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Munt</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) is always going away in the middle of a programme,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Tibby</b></font>)</div>said Tibby.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The music has evidently moved her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) deeply,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fraulein Mosebach</b></font>)</div>said
Fraulein Mosebach.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Excuse me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>said Margaret's young man, who had for some
time been preparing a sentence, <div class="bookquote">``but that lady has, quite
inadvertently, taken my umbrella.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret man</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, good gracious me! --I am so sorry. Tibby, run
after Helen.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall miss the Four Serious Songs if I do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Tibby love, you must go.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It isn't of any consequence,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the young man, in
truth a little uneasy about his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) umbrella.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But of course it is. Tibby! Tibby!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tibby</b></font>)</div><p/>Tibby rose to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) feet, and wilfully caught his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) person
on the backs of the chairs. By the time he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had tipped up
the seat and had found his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hat, and had deposited his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) full
score in safety, it was <div class="bookquote">``too late''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>to go after Helen. The
Four Serious Songs had begun, and one could not move during
their performance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My sister is so careless,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>whispered Margaret.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not at all,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>replied the young man; but his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) voice was
dead and cold.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you would give me your address--''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, not at all, not at all;''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wrapped his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
greatcoat over his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knees.

<p/>Then the Four Serious Songs rang shallow in Margaret's
ears. Brahms, for all his (<font color='blue'><b>Brahms</b></font>) grumbling and grizzling, had
never guessed what it felt like to be suspected of stealing
an umbrella. For this fool of a young man thought that she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
and Helen and Tibby had been playing the confidence trick on
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and that if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) gave his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) address they would break into
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) rooms some midnight or other and steal his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) walkingstick
too. Most ladies would have laughed, but Margaret really
minded, for it gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) a glimpse into squalor. To trust
people is a luxury in which only the wealthy can indulge;
the poor cannot afford it. As soon as Brahms had grunted
himself out, she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Brahms</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) card and said, <div class="bookquote">``That is where
we live; if you preferred, you could call for the umbrella
after the concert, but I didn't like to trouble you when it
has all been our fault.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Brahms</b></font>) face brightened a little when he (<font color='blue'><b>Brahms</b></font>) saw that Wickham
Place was W. It was sad to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Brahms</b></font>) corroded with suspicion,
and yet not daring to be impolite, in case these
well-dressed people were honest after all. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) took it as a
good sign that he (<font color='blue'><b>Brahms</b></font>) said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``It's a fine programme this
afternoon, is it not?''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>for this was the remark with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Brahms</b></font>)
had originally opened, before the umbrella intervened.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The Beethoven's fine,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>said Margaret, who was not a
female of the encouraging type. <div class="bookquote">``I don't like the Brahms,
though, nor the Mendelssohn that came first--and ugh! I
don't like this Elgar that's coming.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What, what?''  (<font color='red'><b>Herr Liesecke/Herr</b></font>)</div>called Herr Liesecke, overhearing. <div class="bookquote">``The
POMP AND CIRCUMSTANCE will not be fine?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Margaret, you tiresome girl!''  (<font color='red'><b>aunt</b></font>)</div>cried her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) aunt.
<div class="bookquote">``Here have I been persuading Herr Liesecke to stop for POMP
AND CIRCUMSTANCE, and you are undoing all my work. I am so
anxious for him (<font color='blue'><b>Liesecke</b></font>) to hear what we are doing in music. Oh, you
mustn't run down our English composers, Margaret.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``For my part, I have heard the composition at Stettin,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Fraulein Mosebach</b></font>)</div>said Fraulein Mosebach. <div class="bookquote">``On two occasions. It is dramatic,
a little.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Frieda, you despise English music. You know you do.
And English art. And English Literature, except Shakespeare
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Shakespeare</b></font>)'s a German. Very well, Frieda, you may go.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The lovers</b></font>)</div><p/>The lovers laughed and glanced at each other. Moved by
a common impulse, they rose to their feet and fled from POMP
AND CIRCUMSTANCE.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We have this call to play in Finsbury Circus, it is
true,''  (<font color='red'><b>Herr Liesecke/Herr</b></font>)</div>said Herr Liesecke, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Liesecke</b></font>) edged past her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) and reached
the gangway just as the music started.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Margaret--''  (<font color='red'><b>Aunt Juley/Juley</b></font>)</div>loudly whispered by Aunt Juley. <div class="bookquote">``Margaret,
Margaret! Fraulein Mosebach has left her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) beautiful little
bag behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) on the seat.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Frieda/Frieda Mosebach</b></font>)</div><p/>Sure enough, there was Frieda's reticule, containing her (<font color='blue'><b>Frieda</b></font>)
address book, her (<font color='blue'><b>Frieda</b></font>) pocket dictionary, her (<font color='blue'><b>Frieda</b></font>) map of London, and
her (<font color='blue'><b>Frieda</b></font>) money.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, what a bother--what a family we are! Fr-Frieda!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hush!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said all those who thought the music fine.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But it's the number they want in Finsbury Circus--''

 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Might I--couldn't I--''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the suspicious young man,
and got very red.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I would be so grateful.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) took the bag--money clinking inside it--and slipped
up the gangway with it. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was just in time to catch them
at the swing-door, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) received a pretty smile from the
German girl and a fine bow from her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) cavalier. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) returned
to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) seat up-sides with the world. The trust that they
had reposed in him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was trivial, but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) felt that it
cancelled his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mistrust for them, and that probably he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would
not be <div class="bookquote">``had''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>over his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) umbrella. This young man had been
<div class="bookquote">``had''  (<font color='red'><b>This man</b></font>)</div>in the past--badly, perhaps overwhelmingly--and now
most of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) energies went in defending himself against the
unknown. But this afternoon--perhaps on account of
music--he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) perceived that one must slack off occasionally, or
what is the good of being alive? Wickham Place, W., though
a risk, was as safe as most things, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) would risk it.

<p/>So when the concert was over and Margaret said, <div class="bookquote">``We live
quite near; I am going there now. Could you walk around
with me, and we'll find your umbrella?''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Thank
you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>peaceably, and followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) out of the Queen's Hall.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) wished that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) was not so anxious to hand a lady
downstairs, or to carry a lady's programme for her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)--his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>)
class was near enough her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) own for its manners to vex her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>).
But she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) found him (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) interesting on the whole--every one
interested the Schlegels on the whole at that time--and
while her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) lips talked culture, her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) heart was planning to
invite him (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) to tea.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How tired one gets after music!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) began.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you find the atmosphere of Queen's Hall oppressive?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, horribly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But surely the atmosphere of Covent Garden is even more
oppressive.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you go there much?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``When my work permits, I attend the gallery for, the
Royal Opera.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Helen</b></font>)</div><p/>Helen would have exclaimed, <div class="bookquote">``So do I. I love the
gallery,''  (<font color='red'><b>Helen</b></font>)</div>and thus have endeared herself to the young man.
Helen could do these things. But Margaret had an almost
morbid horror of <div class="bookquote">``drawing people out,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>of <div class="bookquote">``making things
go.''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) had been to the gallery at Covent Garden, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
did not <div class="bookquote">``attend''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>it, preferring the more expensive seats;
still less did she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) love it. So she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) made no reply.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This year I have been three times--to FAUST, TOSCA,
and--''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Was it <div class="bookquote">``Tannhouser''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>or <div class="bookquote">``Tannhoyser'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>? Better not risk
the word.

<p/>Margaret disliked TOSCA and FAUST. And so, for one
reason and another, they walked on in silence, chaperoned by
the voice of Mrs. Munt, who was getting into difficulties
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Munt</b></font>) nephew.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I do in a WAY remember the passage, Tibby, but when
every instrument is so beautiful, it is difficult to pick
out one thing rather than another. I am sure that you and
Helen take me to the very nicest concerts. Not a dull note
from beginning to end. I only wish that our German friends
would have stayed till it finished.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But surely you haven't forgotten the drum steadily
beating on the low C, Aunt Juley?''  (<font color='red'><b>Tibby</b></font>)</div>came Tibby's voice. <div class="bookquote">``No
one could. It's unmistakable.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A specially loud part?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Munt</b></font>)</div>hazarded Mrs. Munt. <div class="bookquote">``Of course
I do not go in for being musical,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Munt</b></font>) added, the shot
failing. <div class="bookquote">``I only care for music--a very different thing.
But still I will say this for myself--I do know when I like
a thing and when I don't. Some people are the same about
pictures. They can go into a picture gallery--Miss Conder
can--and say straight off what they feel, all round the
wall. I never could do that. But music is so different to
pictures, to my mind. When it comes to music I am as safe
as houses, and I assure you, Tibby, I am by no means pleased
by everything. There was a thing--something about a faun in
French--which Helen went into ecstasies over, but I thought
it most tinkling and superficial, and said so, and I held to
my opinion too.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you agree?''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>asked Margaret. <div class="bookquote">``Do you think music is
so different to pictures?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I--I should have thought so, kind of,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So should I. Now, my sister declares they're just the
same. We have great arguments over it. She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) says I'm dense;
I say she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)'s sloppy.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Getting under way, she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) cried: ``Now,
doesn't it seem absurd to you? What is the good of the Arts
if they are interchangeable? What is the good of the ear if
it tells you the same as the eye? Helen's one aim is to
translate tunes into the language of painting, and pictures
into the language of music. It's very ingenious, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>)
says several pretty things in the process, but what's
gained, I'd like to know? Oh, it's all rubbish, radically
false. If Monet's really Debussy, and Debussy's really
Monet, neither gentleman is worth his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) salt--that's my opinion.

<p/>Evidently these sisters quarrelled.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, this very symphony that we've just been
having--she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) won't let it alone. She (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) labels it with meanings
from start to finish; turns it into literature. I wonder if
the day will ever return when music will be treated as
music. Yet I don't know. There's my brother--behind us.
He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) treats music as music, and oh, my goodness! He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) makes me
angrier than anyone, simply furious. With him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) I daren't
even argue.''

 (<font color='red'><b>An family</b></font>)</div><p/>An unhappy family, if talented.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But, of course, the real villain is Wagner. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wagner</b></font>) has
done more than any man in the nineteenth century towards the
muddling of arts. I do feel that music is in a very serious
state just now, though extraordinarily interesting. Every
now and then in history there do come these terrible
geniuses, like Wagner, who stir up all the wells of thought
at once. For a moment it's splendid. Such a splash as
never was. But afterwards--such a lot of mud; and the
wells--as it were, they communicate with each other too
easily now, and not one of them will run quite clear.
That's what Wagner's done.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) speeches fluttered away from the young man like
birds. If only he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could talk like this, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would have
caught the world. Oh to acquire culture! Oh, to pronounce
foreign names correctly! Oh, to be well informed,
discoursing at ease on every subject that a lady started!
But it would take one years. With an hour at lunch and a
few shattered hours in the evening, how was it possible to
catch up with leisured women, who had been reading steadily
from childhood? His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) brain might be full of names, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) might
have even heard of Monet and Debussy; the trouble was that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Monet</b></font>) could not string them together into a sentence, he (<font color='blue'><b>Monet</b></font>) could
not make them <div class="bookquote">``tell,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Monet</b></font>) could not quite forget about his (<font color='blue'><b>Monet</b></font>)
stolen umbrella. Yes, the umbrella was the real trouble.
Behind Monet and Debussy the umbrella persisted, with the
steady beat of a drum. <div class="bookquote">``I suppose my umbrella will be all
right,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Monet</b></font>) was thinking. <div class="bookquote">``I don't really mind about it. I
will think about music instead. I suppose my umbrella will
be all right.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Earlier in the afternoon he (<font color='blue'><b>Monet</b></font>) had worried about
seats. Ought he (<font color='blue'><b>Monet</b></font>) to have paid as much as two shillings?
Earlier still he (<font color='blue'><b>Monet</b></font>) had wondered, <div class="bookquote">``Shall I try to do without a
programme?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>There had always been something to worry him (<font color='blue'><b>Monet</b></font>)
ever since he (<font color='blue'><b>Monet</b></font>) could remember, always something that
distracted him (<font color='blue'><b>Monet</b></font>) in the pursuit of beauty. For he (<font color='blue'><b>Monet</b></font>) did pursue
beauty, and therefore, Margaret's speeches did flutter away
from him (<font color='blue'><b>Monet</b></font>) like birds.

<p/>Margaret talked ahead, occasionally saying, <div class="bookquote">``Don't you
think so? don't you feel the same?''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>And once she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) stopped,
and said <div class="bookquote">``Oh, do interrupt me!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>which terrified him (<font color='blue'><b>Monet</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
did not attract him (<font color='blue'><b>Monet</b></font>), though she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) filled him (<font color='blue'><b>Monet</b></font>) with awe. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
figure was meagre, her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) face seemed all teeth and eyes, her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
references to her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) sister and brother were uncharitable. For
all her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) cleverness and culture, she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) was probably one of
those soulless, atheistical women who have been so shown up
by Miss Corelli. It was surprising -LRB-and alarming-RRB- that she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
should suddenly say, <div class="bookquote">``I do hope that you'll come in and have
some tea.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do hope that you'll come in and have some tea. We
should be so glad. I have dragged you so far out of your way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Wickham</b></font>)</div><p/>They had arrived at Wickham Place. The sun had set, and
the backwater, in deep shadow, was filling with a gentle
haze. To the right of the fantastic skyline of the flats
towered black against the hues of evening; to the left the
older houses raised a square-cut, irregular parapet against
the grey. Margaret fumbled for her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) latchkey. Of course she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
had forgotten it. So, grasping her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) umbrella by its ferrule,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) leant over the area and tapped at the dining-room window.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Helen! Let us in!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``All right,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said a voice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You've been taking this gentleman's umbrella.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Taken a what?''  (<font color='red'><b>Helen</b></font>)</div>said Helen, opening the door. <div class="bookquote">``Oh,
what's that? Do come in! How do you do?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Helen, you must not be so ramshackly. You took this
gentleman's umbrella away from Queen's Hall, and he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) has had
the trouble of coming for it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I am so sorry!''  (<font color='red'><b>Helen</b></font>)</div>cried Helen, all her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) hair flying.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) had pulled off her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) hat as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) returned, and had
flung herself into the big dining-room chair. <div class="bookquote">``I do nothing
but steal umbrellas. I am so very sorry! Do come in and
choose one. Is yours a hooky or a nobbly? Mine's a
nobbly--at least, I THINK it is.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Helen</b></font>)</div><p/>The light was turned on, and they began to search the
hall, Helen, who had abruptly parted with the Fifth
Symphony, commenting with shrill little cries.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't you talk, Meg! You stole an old gentleman's silk
top-hat. Yes, she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) did, Aunt Juley. It is a positive fact.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Juley</b></font>) thought it was a muff. Oh, heavens! I've knocked the
In and Out card down. Where's Frieda? Tibby, why don't you
ever--No, I can't remember what I was going to say. That
wasn't it, but do tell the maids to hurry tea up. What
about this umbrella?''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) opened it. <div class="bookquote">``No, it's all gone
along the seams. It's an appalling umbrella. It must be mine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>But it was not.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) took it from her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>), murmured a few words of thanks, and
then fled, with the lilting step of the clerk.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But if you will stop--''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>cried Margaret. <div class="bookquote">``Now, Helen,
how stupid you've been!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Whatever have I done?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't you see that you've frightened him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) away? I meant
him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) to stop to tea. You oughtn't to talk about stealing or
holes in an umbrella. I saw his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) nice eyes getting so
miserable. No, it's not a bit of good now.''  (<font color='red'><b>Helen</b></font>)</div>For Helen had
darted out into the street, shouting, <div class="bookquote">``Oh, do stop!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Helen</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I dare say it is all for the best,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Munt</b></font>)</div>opined Mrs. Munt.
<div class="bookquote">``We know nothing about the young man, Margaret, and your
drawing-room is full of very tempting little things.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Helen</b></font>)</div><p/>But Helen cried: <div class="bookquote">``Aunt Juley, how can you! You make me
more and more ashamed. I'd rather he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) HAD been a thief and
taken all the apostle spoons than that I--Well, I must shut
the front-door, I suppose. One more failure for Helen.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Helen</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I think the apostle spoons could have gone as
rent,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>said Margaret. Seeing that her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) aunt did not
understand, she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) added: ``You remember ``rent.'' It was one of
father's words--Rent to the ideal, to his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) own faith in human
nature. You remember how he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) would trust strangers, and if
they fooled him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) would say, <div class="bookquote">``It's better to be fooled than
to be suspicious'--that the confidence trick is the work of
man, but the want-of-confidence-trick is the work of the devil.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I remember something of the sort now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Munt</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Munt,
rather tartly, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Munt</b></font>) longed to add, <div class="bookquote">``It was lucky that
your father married a wife with money.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>But this was unkind,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Munt</b></font>) contented herself with, <div class="bookquote">``Why, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) might have stolen
the little Ricketts picture as well.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Better that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had,''  (<font color='red'><b>Helen</b></font>)</div>said Helen stoutly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I agree with Aunt Juley,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>said Margaret. <div class="bookquote">``I'd
rather mistrust people than lose my little Ricketts. There
are limits.''

 (<font color='red'><b>brother</b></font>)</div><p/>Their brother, finding the incident commonplace, had
stolen upstairs to see whether there were scones for tea.
He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) warmed the teapot--almost too deftly--rejected the Orange
Pekoe that the parlour-maid had provided, poured in five
spoonfuls of a superior blend, filled up with really boiling
water, and now called to the ladies to be quick or they
would lose the aroma.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``All right, Auntie Tibby,''  (<font color='red'><b>Helen</b></font>)</div>called Helen, while Margaret,
thoughtful again, said: <div class="bookquote">``In a way, I wish we had a real boy
in the house--the kind of boy who cares for men. It would
make entertaining so much easier.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So do I,''  (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) sister. <div class="bookquote">``Tibby only cares for
cultured females singing Brahms.''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>And when they joined him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)
she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) said rather sharply: <div class="bookquote">``Why didn't you make that young man
welcome, Tibby? You must do the host a little, you know.
You ought to have taken his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hat and coaxed him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) into
stopping, instead of letting him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) be swamped by screaming women.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Tibby sighed, and drew a long strand of hair over his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) forehead.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, it's no good looking superior. I mean what I say.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Leave Tibby alone!''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>said Margaret, who could not bear
her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) brother to be scolded.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here's the house a regular hen-coop!''  (<font color='red'><b>Helen</b></font>)</div>grumbled Helen.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, my dear!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Munt</b></font>)</div>protested Mrs. Munt. <div class="bookquote">``How can you say
such dreadful things! The number of men you get here has
always astonished me. If there is any danger it's the other
way round.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, but it's the wrong sort of men, Helen means.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I don't,''  (<font color='red'><b>Helen</b></font>)</div>corrected Helen. <div class="bookquote">``We get the right sort
of man, but the wrong side of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and I say that's Tibby's

don't know what.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``A touch of the W.<div class="bookquote">``s, perhaps?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Helen</b></font>)</div><p/>Helen put out her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) tongue.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who are the W.'s?''  (<font color='red'><b>Tibby</b></font>)</div>asked Tibby.

<p/>``The W.<div class="bookquote">``s are things I and Meg and Aunt Juley know about
and you don't, so there!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose that ours is a female house,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>said Margaret,
<div class="bookquote">``and one must just accept it. No, Aunt Juley, I don't mean
that this house is full of women. I am trying to say
something much more clever. I mean that it was irrevocably
feminine, even in father's time. Now I'm sure you
understand! Well, I'll give you another example. It'll
shock you, but I don't care. Suppose Queen Victoria gave a
dinner-party, and that the guests had been Leighton,
Millais, Swinburne, Rossetti, Meredith, Fitzgerald, etc.. Do
you suppose that the atmosphere of that dinner would have
been artistic? Heavens no! The very chairs on which they
sat would have seen to that. So with our house--it must be
feminine, and all we can do is to see that it isn't
effeminate. Just as another house that I can mention, but I
won't, sounded irrevocably masculine, and all its inmates
can do is to see that it isn't brutal.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div><p/>``That house being the W.<div class="bookquote">``s house, I presume,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Tibby.

<p/>``You're not going to be told about the W.``s, my child,''
Helen cried, <div class="bookquote">``so don't you think it. And on the other hand,
I don't the least mind if you find out, so don't you think
you've done anything clever, in either case. Give me a cigarette.''

 (<font color='red'><b>child</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You do what you can for the house,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>said Margaret.
<div class="bookquote">``The drawing-room reeks of smoke.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you smoked too, the house might suddenly turn
masculine. Atmosphere is probably a question of touch and
go. Even at Queen Victoria's dinner-party--if something had
been just a little different--perhaps if she (<font color='blue'><b>Victoria</b></font>)'d worn a
clinging Liberty tea-gown instead of a magenta satin--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``With an Indian shawl over her (<font color='blue'><b>Victoria</b></font>) shoulders--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Fastened at the bosom with a Cairngorm-pin--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div><p/>Bursts of disloyal laughter--you must remember that they
are half German--greeted these suggestions, and Margaret
said pensively, <div class="bookquote">``How inconceivable it would be if the Royal
Family cared about Art.''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>And the conversation drifted away
and away, and Helen's cigarette turned to a spot in the
darkness, and the great flats opposite were sown with
lighted windows, which vanished and were relit again, and
vanished incessantly. Beyond them the thoroughfare roared
gently--a tide that could never be quiet, while in the east,
invisible behind the smokes of Wapping, the moon was rising.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That reminds me, Margaret. We might have taken that
young man into the dining-room, at all events. Only the
majolica plate--and that is so firmly set in the wall. I am
really distressed that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had no tea.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the women</b></font>)</div><p/>For that little incident had impressed the three women
more than might be supposed. It remained as a goblin
football, as a hint that all is not for the best in the best
of all possible worlds, and that beneath these
superstructures of wealth and art there wanders an ill-fed
boy, who has recovered his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) umbrella indeed, but who has left
no address behind him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), and no name.


<p/>Chapter 6

<p/>We are not concerned with the very poor. They are
unthinkable, and only to be approached by the statistician
or the poet. This story deals with gentlefolk, or with
those who are obliged to pretend that they are gentlefolk.

<p/>The boy, Leonard Bast, stood at the extreme verge of
gentility. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bast</b></font>) was not in the abyss, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Bast</b></font>) could see it,
and at times people whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Bast</b></font>) knew had dropped in, and counted
no more. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bast</b></font>) knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bast</b></font>) was poor, and would admit it: he (<font color='blue'><b>Bast</b></font>)
would have died sooner than confess any inferiority to the
rich. This may be splendid of him (<font color='blue'><b>Bast</b></font>). But he (<font color='blue'><b>Bast</b></font>) was inferior to
most rich people, there is not the least doubt of it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bast</b></font>)
was not as courteous as the average rich man, nor as
intelligent, nor as healthy, nor as lovable. His (<font color='blue'><b>Bast</b></font>) mind and
his (<font color='blue'><b>Bast</b></font>) body had been alike underfed, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Bast</b></font>) was poor, and
because he (<font color='blue'><b>Bast</b></font>) was modern they were always craving better food.
Had he (<font color='blue'><b>Bast</b></font>) lived some centuries ago, in the brightly coloured
civilizations of the past, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bast</b></font>) would have had a definite
status, his (<font color='blue'><b>Bast</b></font>) rank and his (<font color='blue'><b>Bast</b></font>) income would have corresponded.
But in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bast</b></font>) day the angel of Democracy had arisen,
enshadowing the classes with leathern wings, and
proclaiming, <div class="bookquote">``All men are equal--all men, that is to say,
who possess umbrellas,''  (<font color='red'><b>the angel</b></font>)</div>and so he (<font color='blue'><b>Bast</b></font>) was obliged to assert
gentility, lest he (<font color='blue'><b>Bast</b></font>) slipped into the abyss where nothing
counts, and the statements of Democracy are inaudible.

<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Bast</b></font>) walked away from Wickham Place, his (<font color='blue'><b>Bast</b></font>) first care was
to prove that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bast</b></font>) was as good as the Miss Schlegels.
Obscurely wounded in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bast</b></font>) pride, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bast</b></font>) tried to wound them in
return. They were probably not ladies. Would real ladies
have asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Bast</b></font>) to tea? They were certainly ill-natured and
cold. At each step his (<font color='blue'><b>Bast</b></font>) feeling of superiority increased.
Would a real lady have talked about stealing an umbrella?
Perhaps they were thieves after all, and if he (<font color='blue'><b>Bast</b></font>) had gone into
the house they could have clapped a chloroformed
handkerchief over his (<font color='blue'><b>Bast</b></font>) face. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bast</b></font>) walked on complacently as
far as the Houses of Parliament. There an empty stomach
asserted itself, and told him (<font color='blue'><b>Bast</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Bast</b></font>) was a fool.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Evening, Mr. Bast.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Evening, Mr. Dealtry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nice evening.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Evening.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Dealtry</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Dealtry, a fellow clerk, passed on, and Leonard
stood wondering whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) would take the tram as far as a
penny would take him (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>), or whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) would walk. He (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) decided
to walk--it is no good giving in, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) had spent money
enough at Queen's Hall--and he (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) walked over Westminster
Bridge, in front of St. Thomas's Hospital, and through the
immense tunnel that passes under the South-Western main line
at Vauxhall. In the tunnel he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) paused and listened to the
roar of the trains. A sharp pain darted through his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) head,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) was conscious of the exact form of his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) eye sockets.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) pushed on for another mile, and did not slacken speed
until he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) stood at the entrance of a road called Camelia
Road, which was at present his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) home.

<p/>Here he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) stopped again, and glanced suspiciously to right
and left, like a rabbit that is going to bolt into its
hole. A block of flats, constructed with extreme cheapness,
towered on either hand. Farther down the road two more
blocks were being built, and beyond these an old house was
being demolished to accommodate another pair. It was the
kind of scene that may be observed all over London, whatever
the locality--bricks and mortar rising and falling with the
restlessness of the water in a fountain, as the city
receives more and more men upon her (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) soil. Camelia Road
would soon stand out like a fortress, and command, for a
little, an extensive view. Only for a little. Plans were
out for the erection of flats in Magnolia Road also. And
again a few years, and all the flats in either road might be
pulled down, and new buildings, of a vastness at present
unimaginable, might arise where they had fallen.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Evening, Mr. Bast.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Evening, Mr. Cunningham.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very serious thing this decline of the birth-rate in Manchester.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I beg your pardon?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very serious thing this decline of the birth-rate in
Manchester,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cunningham</b></font>)</div>repeated Mr. Cunningham, tapping the Sunday
paper, in which the calamity in question had just been
announced to him (<font color='blue'><b>Cunningham</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Leonard/Leonard Bast/Bast</b></font>)</div>said Leonard, who was not going to let on
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) had not bought a Sunday paper.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If this kind of thing goes on the population of England
will be stationary in 1960.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't say so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I call it a very serious thing, eh?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good-evening, Mr. Cunningham.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good-evening, Mr. Bast.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Leonard/Leonard Bast/Bast</b></font>)</div><p/>Then Leonard entered Block B of the flats, and turned,
not upstairs, but down, into what is known to house agents
as a semi-basement, and to other men as a cellar. He (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) opened
the door, and cried <div class="bookquote">``Hullo!''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>with the pseudo-geniality of
the Cockney. There was no reply. <div class="bookquote">``Hullo!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) repeated.
The sitting-room was empty, though the electric light had
been left burning. A look of relief came over his (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) face, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) flung himself into the armchair.

<p/>The sitting-room contained, besides the armchair, two
other chairs, a piano, a three-legged table, and a cosy
corner. Of the walls, one was occupied by the window, the
other by a draped mantelshelf bristling with Cupids.
Opposite the window was the door, and beside the door a
bookcase, while over the piano there extended one of the
masterpieces of Maud Goodman. It was an amorous and not
unpleasant little hole when the curtains were drawn, and the
lights turned on, and the gas-stove unlit. But it struck
that shallow makeshift note that is so often heard in the
modem dwelling-place. It had been too easily gained, and
could be relinquished too easily.

<p/>As Leonard was kicking off his (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) boots he (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) jarred the
three-legged table, and a photograph frame, honourably
poised upon it, slid sideways, fell off into the fireplace,
and smashed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) swore in a colourless sort of way, and
picked the photograph up. It represented a young lady
called Jacky, and had been taken at the time when young
ladies called Jacky were often photographed with their
mouths open. Teeth of dazzling whiteness extended along
either of Jacky's jaws, and positively weighted her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) head
sideways, so large were they and so numerous. Take my word
for it, that smile was simply stunning, and it is only you
and I who will be fastidious, and complain that true joy
begins in the eyes, and that the eyes of Jacky did not
accord with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) smile, but were anxious and hungry.

<p/>Leonard tried to pull out the fragments of glass, and
cut his (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) fingers and swore again. A drop of blood fell on
the frame, another followed, spilling over on to the exposed
photograph. He (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) swore more vigorously, and dashed to the
kitchen, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) bathed his (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) hands. The kitchen was the
same size as the sitting room; through it was a bedroom.
This completed his (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) home. He (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) was renting the flat furnished:
of all the objects that encumbered it none were his (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) own
except the photograph frame, the Cupids, and the books.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Damn, damn, damnation!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) murmured, together with such
other words as he (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) had learnt from older men. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) raised
his (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) hand to his (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) forehead and said, <div class="bookquote">``Oh, damn it all--''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>which
meant something different. He (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) pulled himself together. He (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>)
drank a little tea, black and silent, that still survived
upon an upper shelf. He (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) swallowed some dusty crumbs of
cake. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) went back to the sitting-room, settled
himself anew, and began to read a volume of Ruskin.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Seven miles to the north of Venice--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>How perfectly the famous chapter opens! How supreme its
command of admonition and of poetry! The rich man is
speaking to us from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) gondola.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Seven miles to the north of Venice the banks of sand
which nearer the city rise little above low-water mark
attain by degrees a higher level, and knit themselves at
last into fields of salt morass, raised here and there into
shapeless mounds, and intercepted by narrow creeks of sea.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Leonard/Leonard Bast/Bast</b></font>)</div><p/>Leonard was trying to form his (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) style on Ruskin: he (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>)
understood him (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) to be the greatest master of English Prose.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) read forward steadily, occasionally making a few notes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let us consider a little each of these characters in
succession, and first -LRB-for of the shafts enough has been
said already-RRB-, what is very peculiar to this church--its luminousness.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Was there anything to be learnt from this fine
sentence? Could he (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) adapt it to the needs of daily life?
Could he (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) introduce it, with modifications, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) next
wrote a letter to his (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) brother, the lay-reader? For example--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let us consider a little each of these characters in
succession, and first -LRB-for of the absence of ventilation
enough has been said already-RRB-, what is very peculiar to this
flat--its obscurity. ''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>Something told him (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) that the modifications would not do;
and that something, had he (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) known it, was the spirit of
English Prose. <div class="bookquote">``My flat is dark as well as stuffy.''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Those
were the words for him (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>).

<p/>And the voice in the gondola rolled on, piping
melodiously of Effort and Self-Sacrifice, full of high
purpose, full of beauty, full even of sympathy and the love
of men, yet somehow eluding all that was actual and
insistent in Leonard's life. For it was the voice of one
who had never been dirty or hungry, and had not guessed
successfully what dirt and hunger are.

<p/>Leonard listened to it with reverence. He (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>)
was being done good to, and that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) kept on with Ruskin,
and the Queen's Hall Concerts, and some pictures by Watts,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Ruskin</b></font>) would one day push his (<font color='blue'><b>Ruskin</b></font>) head out of the grey waters and
see the universe. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ruskin</b></font>) believed in sudden conversion, a
belief which may be right, but which is peculiarly
attractive to a half-baked mind. It is the bias of much
popular religion: in the domain of business it dominates the
Stock Exchange, and becomes that <div class="bookquote">``bit of luck''  (<font color='red'><b>Stock Exchange</b></font>)</div>by which all
successes and failures are explained. <div class="bookquote">``If only I had a bit
of luck, the whole thing would come straight... He (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>)'s
got a most magnificent place down at Streatham and a 20
h.-p. Fiat, but then, mind you, he (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>)'s had luck... I'm
sorry the wife's so late, but she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) never has any luck over
catching trains.''  (<font color='red'><b>Leonard/Leonard Bast/Bast</b></font>)</div>Leonard was superior to these people; he (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>)
did believe in effort and in a steady preparation for the
change that he (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) desired. But of a heritage that may expand
gradually, he (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) had no conception: he (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) hoped to come to Culture
suddenly, much as the Revivalist hopes to come to Jesus.
Those Miss Schlegels had come to it; they had done the
trick; their hands were upon the ropes, once and for all.
And meanwhile, his (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) flat was dark, as well as stuffy.

<p/>Presently there was a noise on the staircase. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) shut
up Margaret's card in the pages of Ruskin, and opened the
door. A woman entered, of whom it is simplest to say that
she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was not respectable. Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) appearance was awesome. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
seemed all strings and bell-pulls--ribbons, chains, bead
necklaces that clinked and caught--and a boa of azure
feathers hung round her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) neck, with the ends uneven. Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
throat was bare, wound with a double row of pearls, her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) arms
were bare to the elbows, and might again be detected at the
shoulder, through cheap lace. Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hat, which was flowery,
resembled those punnets, covered with flannel, which we
sowed with mustard and cress in our childhood, and which
germinated here yes, and there no. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) wore it on the back
of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) head. As for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hair, or rather hairs, they are too
complicated to describe, but one system went down her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) back,
lying in a thick pad there, while another, created for a
lighter destiny, rippled around her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) forehead. The face--the
face does not signify. It was the face of the photograph,
but older, and the teeth were not so numerous as the
photographer had suggested, and certainly not so white.
Yes, Jacky was past her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) prime, whatever that prime may have
been. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was descending quicker than most women into the
colourless years, and the look in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) eyes confessed it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What ho!''  (<font color='red'><b>Leonard/Leonard Bast/Bast</b></font>)</div>said Leonard, greeting that apparition with
much spirit, and helping it off with its boa.

<p/>Jacky, in husky tones, replied, <div class="bookquote">``What ho!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jacky</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Been out?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) asked. The question sounds superfluous,
but it cannot have been really, for the lady answered, <div class="bookquote">``No,''
 (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>adding, <div class="bookquote">``Oh, I am so tired.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You tired?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Eh?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm tired,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>), hanging the boa up.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Len, I am so tired.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I've been to that classical concert I told you about,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Leonard/Leonard Bast/Bast</b></font>)</div>said Leonard.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What's that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I came back as soon as it was over.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Any one been round to our place?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jacky</b></font>)</div>asked Jacky.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not that I've seen. I met Mr. Cunningham outside, and
we passed a few remarks.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What, not Mr. Cunnginham?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, you mean Mr. Cunningham.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. Mr. Cunningham.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I've been out to tea at a lady friend's.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the lady-friend</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) secret being at last given to the world, and the
name of the lady-friend being even adumbrated, Jacky made no
further experiments in the difficult and tiring art of
conversation. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) never had been a great talker. Even in
her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) photographic days she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had relied upon her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) smile and her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
figure to attract, and now that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``On the shelf,
On the shelf,
Boys, boys, I'm on the shelf,''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was not likely to find her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) tongue. Occasional
bursts of song -LRB-of which the above is an example-RRB- still
issued from her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) lips, but the spoken word was rare.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) sat down on Leonard's knee, and began to fondle
him (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was now a massive woman of thirty-three, and her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
weight hurt him (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>), but he (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) could not very well say anything.
Then she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Is that a book you're reading?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) said,
<div class="bookquote">``That's a book,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and drew it from her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) unreluctant grasp.
Margaret's card fell out of it. It fell face downwards, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) murmured, <div class="bookquote">``Bookmarker.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Len--''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What is it?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) asked, a little wearily, for she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) only
had one topic of conversation when she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) sat upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) knee.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You do love me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Jacky, you know that I do. How can you ask such questions!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you do love me, Len, don't you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course I do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>A pause. The other remark was still due.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Len--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well? What is it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Len, you will make it all right?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't have you ask me that again,''  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div>said the boy,
flaring up into a sudden passion. <div class="bookquote">``I've promised to marry

and I can't keep on being worried. I've worries enough. It
isn't likely I'd throw you over, let alone my word, when
I've spent all this money. Besides, I'm an Englishman, and
I never go back on my word. Jacky, do be reasonable. Of
course I'll marry you. Only do stop badgering me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``When's your birthday, Len?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I've told you again and again, the eleventh of November
next. Now get off my knee a bit; someone must get supper, I
suppose.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jacky</b></font>)</div><p/>Jacky went through to the bedroom, and began to see to
her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) hat. This meant blowing at it with short sharp puffs.
Leonard tidied up the sitting-room, and began to prepare
their evening meal. He (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) put a penny into the slot of the
gas-meter, and soon the flat was reeking with metallic
fumes. Somehow he (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) could not recover his (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) temper, and all the
time he (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) was cooking he (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) continued to complain bitterly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It really is too bad when a fellow isn't trusted. It
makes one feel so wild, when I've pretended to the people
here that you're my wife--all right, you shall be my
wife--and I've bought you the ring to wear, and I've taken
this flat furnished, and it's far more than I can afford,
and yet you aren't content, and I've also not told the truth
when I've written home.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) lowered his (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) voice. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)'d stop
it.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>In a tone of horror, that was a little luxurious, he (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>)
repeated: ``My brother'd stop it. I'm going against the
whole world, Jacky.

<p/>``That's what I am, Jacky. I don't take any heed of what
anyone says. I just go straight forward, I do. That's
always been my way. I'm not one of your weak knock-kneed
chaps. If a woman's in trouble, I don't leave her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) in the
lurch. That's not my street. No, thank you.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll tell you another thing too. I care a good deal
about improving myself by means of Literature and Art, and
so getting a wider outlook. For instance, when you came in
I was reading Ruskin's STONES OF VENICE. I don't say this to
boast, but just to show you the kind of man I am. I can
tell you, I enjoyed that classical concert this afternoon.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jacky</b></font>)</div><p/>To all his (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) moods Jacky remained equally indifferent.
When supper was ready--and not before--she (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) emerged from the
bedroom, saying: <div class="bookquote">``But you do love me, don't you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>They began with a soup square, which Leonard had just
dissolved in some hot water. It was followed by the
tongue--a freckled cylinder of meat, with a little jelly at
the top, and a great deal of yellow fat at the
bottom--ending with another square dissolved in water
-LRB-jelly: pineapple-RRB-, which Leonard had prepared earlier in
the day. Jacky ate contentedly enough, occasionally looking
at her (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) man with those anxious eyes, to which nothing else in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) appearance corresponded, and which yet seemed to mirror
her (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) soul. And Leonard managed to convince his (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) stomach that
it was having a nourishing meal.

<p/>After supper they smoked cigarettes and exchanged a few
statements. She (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) observed that her (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``likeness''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>had been
broken. He (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) found occasion to remark, for the second time,
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) had come straight back home after the concert at
Queen's Hall. Presently she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) sat upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) knee. The
inhabitants of Camelia Road tramped to and fro outside the
window, just on a level with their heads, and the family in
the flat on the ground-floor began to sing, <div class="bookquote">``Hark, my soul,
it is the Lord.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the family</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That tune fairly gives me the hump,''  (<font color='red'><b>Leonard/Leonard Bast/Bast</b></font>)</div>said Leonard.

<p/>Jacky followed this, and said that, for her (<font color='blue'><b>Road</b></font>) part, she (<font color='blue'><b>Road</b></font>)
thought it a lovely tune.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No; I'll play you something lovely. Get up, dear, for
a minute.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) went to the piano and jingled out a little Grieg. He (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>)
played badly and vulgarly, but the performance was not
without its effect, for Jacky said she (<font color='blue'><b>Road</b></font>) thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Road</b></font>)'d be
going to bed. As she (<font color='blue'><b>Road</b></font>) receded, a new set of interests
possessed the boy, and he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) began to think of what had been
said about music by that odd Miss Schlegel--the one that
twisted her (<font color='blue'><b>Schlegel</b></font>) face about so when she (<font color='blue'><b>Schlegel</b></font>) spoke. Then the thoughts
grew sad and envious. There was the girl named Helen, who
had pinched his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) umbrella, and the German girl who had smiled
at him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) pleasantly, and Herr someone, and Aunt someone, and
the brother--all, all with their hands on the ropes. They
had all passed up that narrow, rich staircase at Wickham
Place, to some ample room, whither he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) could never follow
them, not if he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) read for ten hours a day. Oh, it was not
good, this continual aspiration. Some are born cultured;
the rest had better go in for whatever comes easy. To see
life steadily and to see it whole was not for the likes of him (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>).

<p/>From the darkness beyond the kitchen a voice called, <div class="bookquote">``Len?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You in bed?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) asked, his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) forehead twitching.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``M'm.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``All right.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Presently she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) called him (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I must clean my boots ready for the morning,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) answered.

<p/>Presently she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) called him (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I rather want to get this chapter done.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) closed his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) ears against her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What's that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``All right, Jacky, nothing; I'm reading a book.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) answered, catching her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) degraded deafness.

<p/>Presently she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) called him (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) again.

<p/>Ruskin had visited Torcello by this time, and was
ordering his (<font color='blue'><b>Ruskin</b></font>) gondoliers to take him (<font color='blue'><b>Ruskin</b></font>) to Murano. It occurred
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Ruskin</b></font>), as he (<font color='blue'><b>Ruskin</b></font>) glided over the whispering lagoons, that the
power of Nature could not be shortened by the folly, nor her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>)
beauty altogether saddened by the misery, of such as
Leonard.


<p/>Chapter 7

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Margaret,''  (<font color='red'><b>aunt</b></font>)</div>cried her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) aunt next morning, <div class="bookquote">``such a most
unfortunate thing has happened. I could not get you alone.''

 (<font color='red'><b>aunt</b></font>)</div><p/>The most unfortunate thing was not very serious. One of
the flats in the ornate block opposite had been taken
furnished by the Wilcox family, <div class="bookquote">``coming up, no doubt, in the
hope of getting into London society.''  (<font color='red'><b>the Wilcox family</b></font>)</div>That Mrs. Munt should
be the first to discover the misfortune was not remarkable,
for she (<font color='blue'><b>Munt</b></font>) was so interested in the flats, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Munt</b></font>) watched
their every mutation with unwearying care. In theory she (<font color='blue'><b>Munt</b></font>)
despised them--they took away that old-world look--they cut
off the sun--flats house a flashy type of person. But if
the truth had been known, she (<font color='blue'><b>Munt</b></font>) found her (<font color='blue'><b>Munt</b></font>) visits to Wickham
Place twice as amusing since Wickham Mansions had arisen,
and would in a couple of days learn more about them than her (<font color='blue'><b>Munt</b></font>)
nieces in a couple of months, or her (<font color='blue'><b>Munt</b></font>) nephew in a couple of
years. She (<font color='blue'><b>Munt</b></font>) would stroll across and make friends with the
porters, and inquire what the rents were, exclaiming for
example: <div class="bookquote">``What! a hundred and twenty for a basement?
You'll never get it!''  (<font color='red'><b>the porters</b></font>)</div>And they would answer: <div class="bookquote">``One can but
try, madam.''  (<font color='red'><b>The passenger</b></font>)</div>The passenger lifts, the provision lifts, the
arrangement for coals -LRB-a great temptation for a dishonest
porter-RRB-, were all familiar matters to her (<font color='blue'><b>Munt</b></font>), and perhaps a
relief from the politico-economical-aesthetic atmosphere that
reigned at the Schlegels'.

<p/>Margaret received the information calmly, and did not
agree that it would throw a cloud over poor Helen's life.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, but Helen isn't a girl with no interests,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>)
explained. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) has plenty of other things and other people
to think about. She (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) made a false start with the Wilcoxes,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>)'ll be as willing as we are to have nothing more to
do with them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``For a clever girl, dear, how very oddly you do talk.
Helen'll HAVE to have something more to do with them, now
that they're all opposite. She (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) may meet that Paul in the
street. She (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) cannot very well not bow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) must bow. But look here; let's do the
flowers. I was going to say, the will to be interested in
him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) has died, and what else matters? I look on that
disastrous episode -LRB-over which you were so kind-RRB- as the
killing of a nerve in Helen. It's dead, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>)'ll never be
troubled with it again. The only things that matter are the
things that interest one. Bowing, even calling and leaving
cards, even a dinner-party--we can do all those things to
the Wilcoxes, if they find it agreeable; but the other
thing, the one important thing--never again. Don't you see?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Munt</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Munt did not see, and indeed Margaret was making a
most questionable statement--that any emotion, any interest
once vividly aroused, can wholly die.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I also have the honour to inform you that the Wilcoxes
are bored with us. I didn't tell you at the time--it might
have made you angry, and you had enough to worry you--but I
wrote a letter to Mrs. W., and apologized for the trouble
that Helen had given them. She (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) didn't answer it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How very rude!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wonder. Or was it sensible?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, Margaret, most rude.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In either case one can class it as reassuring.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Munt</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Munt sighed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Munt</b></font>) was going back to Swanage on the
morrow, just as her (<font color='blue'><b>Munt</b></font>) nieces were wanting her (<font color='blue'><b>Munt</b></font>) most. Other
regrets crowded upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Munt</b></font>): for instance, how magnificently
she (<font color='blue'><b>Munt</b></font>) would have cut Charles if she (<font color='blue'><b>Munt</b></font>) had met him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) face to face.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Munt</b></font>) had already seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>), giving an order to the porter--and
very common he (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) looked in a tall hat. But unfortunately his (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>)
back was turned to her (<font color='blue'><b>Munt</b></font>), and though she (<font color='blue'><b>Munt</b></font>) had cut his (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) back, she (<font color='blue'><b>Munt</b></font>)
could not regard this as a telling snub.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But you will be careful, won't you?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Munt</b></font>) exhorted.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, certainly. Fiendishly careful.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And Helen must be careful, too,''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Careful over what?''  (<font color='red'><b>Helen</b></font>)</div>cried Helen, at that moment coming
into the room with her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) cousin.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>said Margaret, seized with a momentary awkwardness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Careful over what, Aunt Juley?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Munt</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Munt assumed a cryptic air. <div class="bookquote">``It is only that a
certain family, whom we know by name but do not mention, as
you said yourself last night after the concert, have taken
the flat opposite from the Mathesons--where the plants are
in the balcony.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Helen</b></font>)</div><p/>Helen began some laughing reply, and then disconcerted
them all by blushing. Mrs. Munt was so disconcerted that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Munt</b></font>) exclaimed, <div class="bookquote">``What, Helen, you don't mind them coming, do
you?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and deepened the blush to crimson.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course I don't mind,''  (<font color='red'><b>Helen</b></font>)</div>said Helen a little crossly.
<div class="bookquote">``It is that you and Meg are both so absurdly grave about it,
when there's nothing to be grave about at all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm not grave,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>protested Margaret, a little cross in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) turn.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, you look grave; doesn't she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>), Frieda?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't feel grave, that's all I can say; you're going
quite on the wrong tack.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, she (<font color='blue'><b>Frieda</b></font>) does not feel grave,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Munt</b></font>)</div>echoed Mrs. Munt. <div class="bookquote">``I can
bear witness to that. She (<font color='blue'><b>Frieda</b></font>) disagrees--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hark!''  (<font color='red'><b>Fraulein Mosebach</b></font>)</div>interrupted Fraulein Mosebach. <div class="bookquote">``I hear Bruno
entering the hall.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Herr Liesecke/Herr</b></font>)</div><p/>For Herr Liesecke was due at Wickham Place to call for
the two younger girls. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) was not entering the hall--in
fact, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) did not enter it for quite five minutes. But
Frieda detected a delicate situation, and said that she (<font color='blue'><b>Frieda</b></font>) and
Helen had much better wait for Bruno down below, and leave
Margaret and Mrs. Munt to finish arranging the flowers.
Helen acquiesced. But, as if to prove that the situation
was not delicate really, she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) stopped in the doorway and said:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Did you say the Mathesons' flat, Aunt Juley? How
wonderful you are! I never knew that the woman who laced
too tightly's name was Matheson.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, Helen,''  (<font color='red'><b>cousin</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) cousin.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Go, Helen,''  (<font color='red'><b>aunt</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) aunt; and continued to Margaret
almost in the same breath: <div class="bookquote">``Helen cannot deceive me, She (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>)
does mind.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, hush!''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>breathed Margaret. <div class="bookquote">``Frieda'll hear you, and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Frieda</b></font>) can be so tiresome.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Frieda</b></font>) minds,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Munt</b></font>)</div>persisted Mrs. Munt, moving thoughtfully
about the room, and pulling the dead chrysanthemums out of
the vases. <div class="bookquote">``I knew she (<font color='blue'><b>Frieda</b></font>)'d mind--and I'm sure a girl ought
to! Such an experience! Such awful coarse-grained people!
I know more about them than you do, which you forget, and if
Charles had taken you that motor drive--well, you'd have
reached the house a perfect wreck. Oh, Margaret, you don't
know what you are in for. They're all bottled up against
the drawing-room window. There's Mrs. Wilcox--I've seen
her (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>). There's Paul. There's Evie, who is a minx. There's
Charles--I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) to start with. And who would an elderly
man with a moustache and a copper-coloured face be?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Wilcox, possibly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I knew it. And there's Mr. Wilcox.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's a shame to call his (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) face copper colour,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>complained Margaret. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) has a remarkably good complexion
for a man of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) age.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Munt</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Munt, triumphant elsewhere, could afford to concede
Mr. Wilcox his (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) complexion. She (<font color='blue'><b>Munt</b></font>) passed on from it to the
plan of campaign that her (<font color='blue'><b>Munt</b></font>) nieces should pursue in the
future. Margaret tried to stop her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Helen did not take the news quite as I expected, but
the Wilcox nerve is dead in her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) really, so there's no need
for plans.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's as well to be prepared.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No--it's as well not to be prepared.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Because--'

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) thought drew being from the obscure borderland. She (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>)
could not explain in so many words, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) felt that those
who prepare for all the emergencies of life beforehand may
equip themselves at the expense of joy. It is necessary to
prepare for an examination, or a dinner-party, or a possible
fall in the price of stock: those who attempt human
relations must adopt another method, or fail. <div class="bookquote">``Because I'd
sooner risk it,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) lame conclusion.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But imagine the evenings,''  (<font color='red'><b>aunt</b></font>)</div>exclaimed her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) aunt, pointing
to the Mansions with the spout of the watering-can. <div class="bookquote">``Turn
the electric light on her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) or there, and it's almost the same
room. One evening they may forget to draw their blinds
down, and you'll see them; and the next, you yours, and
they'll see you. Impossible to sit out on the balconies.
Impossible to water the plants, or even speak. Imagine
going out of the front-door, and they come out opposite at
the same moment. And yet you tell me that plans are
unnecessary, and you'd rather risk it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope to risk things all my life.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Margaret, most dangerous.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But after all,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) continued with a smile, <div class="bookquote">``there's
never any great risk as long as you have money.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, shame! What a shocking speech!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Money pads the edges of things,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Schlegel/Schlegel</b></font>)</div>said Miss Schlegel.
<div class="bookquote">``God help those who have none.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But this is something quite new!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Munt</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Munt, who
collected new ideas as a squirrel collects nuts, and was
especially attracted by those that are portable.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``New for me; sensible people have acknowledged it for
years. You and I and the Wilcoxes stand upon money as upon
islands. It is so firm beneath our feet that we forget its
very existence. It's only when we see someone near us
tottering that we realize all that an independent income
means. Last night, when we were talking up here round the
fire, I began to think that the very soul of the world is
economic, and that the lowest abyss is not the absence of
love, but the absence of coin.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I call that rather cynical.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So do I. But Helen and I, we ought to remember, when we
are tempted to criticize others, that we are standing on
these islands, and that most of the others, are down below
the surface of the sea. The poor cannot always reach those
whom they want to love, and they can hardly ever escape from
those whom they love no longer. We rich can. Imagine the
tragedy last June, if Helen and Paul Wilcox had been poor
people, and couldn't invoke railways and motor-cars to part them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's more like Socialism,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Munt</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Munt suspiciously.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Call it what you like. I call it going through life
with one's hand spread open on the table. I'm tired of
these rich people who pretend to be poor, and think it shows
a nice mind to ignore the piles of money that keep their
feet above the waves. I stand each year upon six hundred
pounds, and Helen upon the same, and Tibby will stand upon
eight, and as fast as our pounds crumble away into the sea
they are renewed--from the sea, yes, from the sea. And all
our thoughts are the thoughts of six-hundred-pounders, and
all our speeches; and because we don't want to steal
umbrellas ourselves, we forget that below the sea people do
want to steal them, and do steal them sometimes, and that
what's a joke up here is down there reality--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There they go--there goes Fraulein Mosebach. Really,
for a German she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) does dress charmingly. Oh--!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What is it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Helen was looking up at the Wilcoxes' flat.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why shouldn't she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I beg your pardon, I interrupted you. What was it you
were saying about reality?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I had worked round to myself, as usual,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>answered
Margaret in tones that were suddenly preoccupied.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do tell me this, at all events. Are you for the rich
or for the poor?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Too difficult. Ask me another. Am I for poverty or
for riches? For riches. Hurrah for riches!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``For riches!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Munt</b></font>)</div>echoed Mrs. Munt, having, as it were, at
last secured her (<font color='blue'><b>Munt</b></font>) nut.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. For riches. Money for ever!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So am I, and so, I am afraid, are most of my
acquaintances at Swanage, but I am surprised that you agree
with us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you so much, Aunt Juley. While I have talked
theories, you have done the flowers.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not at all, dear. I wish you would let me help you in
more important things.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, would you be very kind? Would you come round
with me to the registry office? There's a housemaid who
won't say yes but doesn't say no.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Wilcoxes</b></font>)</div><p/>On their way thither they too looked up at the Wilcoxes'
flat. Evie was in the balcony, <div class="bookquote">``staring most rudely,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Evie/Evie Wilcox</b></font>)</div>according to Mrs. Munt. Oh yes, it was a nuisance, there
was no doubt of it. Helen was proof against a passing
encounter but--Margaret began to lose confidence. Might it
reawake the dying nerve if the family were living close
against her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) eyes? And Frieda Mosebach was stopping with
them for another fortnight, and Frieda was sharp, abominably
sharp, and quite capable of remarking, <div class="bookquote">``You love one of the
young gentlemen opposite, yes?''  (<font color='red'><b>Frieda/Frieda Mosebach</b></font>)</div>The remark would be untrue,
but of the kind which, if stated often enough, may become
true; just as the remark, <div class="bookquote">``England and Germany are bound to
fight,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>renders war a little more likely each time that it
is made, and is therefore made the more readily by the
gutter press of either nation. Have the private emotions
also their gutter press? Margaret thought so, and feared
that good Aunt Juley and Frieda were typical specimens of
it. They might, by continual chatter, lead Helen into a
repetition of the desires of June. Into a repetition--they
could not do more; they could not lead her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) into lasting
love. They were--she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) saw it clearly--Journalism; her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>)
father, with all his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) defects and wrong-headedness, had been
Literature, and had he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) lived, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) would have persuaded his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
daughter rightly.

<p/>The registry office was holding its morning reception.
A string of carriages filled the street. Miss Schlegel
waited her (<font color='blue'><b>Schlegel</b></font>) turn, and finally had to be content with an
insidious <div class="bookquote">``temporary,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Schlegel/Schlegel</b></font>)</div>being rejected by genuine housemaids
on the ground of her (<font color='blue'><b>Schlegel</b></font>) numerous stairs. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Schlegel</b></font>) failure depressed
her (<font color='blue'><b>Schlegel</b></font>), and though she (<font color='blue'><b>Schlegel</b></font>) forgot the failure, the depression
remained. On her (<font color='blue'><b>Schlegel</b></font>) way home she (<font color='blue'><b>Schlegel</b></font>) again glanced up at the
Wilcoxes' flat, and took the rather matronly step of
speaking about the matter to Helen.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Helen, you must tell me whether this thing worries you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If what?''  (<font color='red'><b>Helen</b></font>)</div>said Helen, who was washing her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) hands for lunch.

<p/>``The W.<div class="bookquote">``s coming.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, of course not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Really?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Really.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) admitted that she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) was a little
worried on Mrs. Wilcox's account; she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) implied that Mrs.
Wilcox might reach backward into deep feelings, and be
pained by things that never touched the other members of
that clan. ``I shan't mind if Paul points at our house and
says, ``There lives the girl who tried to catch me.<div class="bookquote">'' But she (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) might.''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If even that worries you, we could arrange something.
There's no reason we should be near people who displease us
or whom we displease, thanks to our money. We might even go
away for a little.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I am going away. Frieda's just asked me to
Stettin, and I shan't be back till after the New Year. Will
that do? Or must I fly the country altogether? Really,
Meg, what has come over you to make such a fuss?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I'm getting an old maid, I suppose. I thought I
minded nothing, but really I--I should be bored if you fell
in love with the same man twice and'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--she (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) cleared her (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>)
throat--<div class="bookquote">``you did go red, you know, when Aunt Juley attacked
you this morning. I shouldn't have referred to it otherwise.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>But Helen's laugh rang true, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) raised a soapy hand
to heaven and swore that never, nowhere and nohow, would she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>)
again fall in love with any of the Wilcox family, down to
its remotest collaterals.


<p/>Chapter 8

<p/>The friendship between Margaret and Mrs. Wilcox, which was
to develop so--quickly and with such strange results, may
perhaps have had its beginnings at Speyer, in the spring.
Perhaps the elder lady, as she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) gazed at the vulgar, ruddy
cathedral, and listened to the talk of Helen and her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>)
husband, may have detected in the other and less charming of
the sisters a deeper sympathy, a sounder judgment. She (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) was
capable of detecting such things. Perhaps it was she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) who
had desired the Miss Schlegels to be invited to Howards End,
and Margaret whose presence she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) had particularly desired.
All this is speculation: Mrs. Wilcox has left few clear
indications behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>). It is certain that she (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) came to call
at Wickham Place a fortnight later, the very day that Helen
was going with her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) cousin to Stettin.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Helen!''  (<font color='red'><b>Fraulein Mosebach</b></font>)</div>cried Fraulein Mosebach in awestruck tones -LRB-she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>)
was now in her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) cousin's confidence-RRB---<div class="bookquote">``his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mother has
forgiven you!''  (<font color='red'><b>cousin</b></font>)</div>And then, remembering that in England the
new-comer ought not to call before she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) is called upon, she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>)
changed her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) tone from awe to disapproval, and opined that
Mrs. Wilcox was <div class="bookquote">``keine Dame.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Wilcox/Mrs. Warrington/Wilcox</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Bother the whole family!''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>snapped Margaret. <div class="bookquote">``Helen,
stop giggling and pirouetting, and go and finish your
packing. Why can't the woman leave us alone?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know what I shall do with Meg,''  (<font color='red'><b>Helen</b></font>)</div>Helen retorted,
collapsing upon the stairs. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>)'s got Wilcox and Box upon
the brain. Meg, Meg, I don't love the young gentleman; I
don't love the young gentleman, Meg, Meg. Can a body speak plainer?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Most certainly her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) love has died,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fraulein Mosebach</b></font>)</div>asserted Fraulein Mosebach.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Most certainly it has, Frieda, but that will not
prevent me from being bored with the Wilcoxes if I return
the call.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Helen</b></font>)</div><p/>Then Helen simulated tears, and Fraulein Mosebach, who
thought her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) extremely amusing, did the same. ``Oh, boo hoo!
boo hoo hoo! Meg's going to return the call, and I can't.
``Cos why? <div class="bookquote">``Cos I'm going to German-eye.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you are going to Germany, go and pack; if you
aren't, go and call on the Wilcoxes instead of me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But, Meg, Meg, I don't love the young gentleman; I
don't love the young--0 lud, who's that coming down the
stairs? I vow `tis my brother. 0 crimini!''

 (<font color='red'><b>A male male</b></font>)</div><p/>A male--even such a male as Tibby--was enough to stop
the foolery. The barrier of sex, though decreasing among
the civilized, is still high, and higher on the side of
women. Helen could tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) sister all, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) cousin much
about Paul; she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) told her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) brother nothing. It was not
prudishness, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) now spoke of <div class="bookquote">``the Wilcox ideal''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>with
laughter, and even with a growing brutality. Nor was it
precaution, for Tibby seldom repeated any news that did not
concern himself. It was rather the feeling that she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>)
betrayed a secret into the camp of men, and that, however
trivial it was on this side of the barrier, it would become
important on that. So she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) stopped, or rather began to fool
on other subjects, until her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) long-suffering relatives drove
her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) upstairs. Fraulein Mosebach followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>), but lingered
to say heavily over the banisters to Margaret, <div class="bookquote">``It is all
right--she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) does not love the young man--he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has not been
worthy of her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I know; thanks very much.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought I did right to tell you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ever so many thanks.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What's that?''  (<font color='red'><b>Tibby</b></font>)</div>asked Tibby. No one told him (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>)
proceeded into the dining-room, to eat Elvas plums.

<p/>That evening Margaret took decisive action. The house
was very quiet, and the fog--we are in November now--pressed
against the windows like an excluded ghost. Frieda and
Helen and all their luggage had gone. Tibby, who was not
feeling well, lay stretched on a sofa by the fire. Margaret
sat by him (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>), thinking. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) mind darted from impulse to
impulse, and finally marshalled them all in review. The
practical person, who knows what he (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) wants at once, and
generally knows nothing else, will excuse her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) of
indecision. But this was the way her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) mind worked. And when
she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) did act, no one could accuse her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) of indecision then.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) hit out as lustily as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) had not considered the
matter at all. The letter that she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) wrote Mrs. Wilcox glowed
with the native hue of resolution. The pale cast of thought
was with her (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) a breath rather than a tarnish, a breath that
leaves the colours all the more vivid when it has been wiped
away.


<p/>Dear Mrs. Wilcox,

<p/>I have to write something discourteous. It would be
better if we did not meet. Both my sister and my aunt
have given displeasure to your family, and, in my
sister's case, the grounds for displeasure might recur.
As far as I know, she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) no longer occupies her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) thoughts
with your son. But it would not be fair, either to her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)
or to you, if they met, and it is therefore right that
our acquaintance which began so pleasantly, should end.

<p/>I fear that you will not agree with this; indeed, I
know that you will not, since you have been good enough
to call on us. It is only an instinct on my part, and no
doubt the instinct is wrong. My sister would,
undoubtedly, say that it is wrong. I write without her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)
knowledge, and I hope that you will not associate her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)
with my discourtesy.

<p/>Believe me,
Yours truly,
M. J. Schlegel


<p/>Margaret sent this letter round by post. Next morning
she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) received the following reply by hand:


<p/>Dear Miss Schlegel,

<p/>You should not have written me such a letter. I
called to tell you that Paul has gone abroad.

<p/>Ruth Wilcox


<p/>Margaret's cheeks burnt. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) could not finish her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
breakfast. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) was on fire with shame. Helen had told her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>)
that the youth was leaving England, but other things had
seemed more important, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) had forgotten. All her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>)
absurd anxieties fell to the ground, and in their place
arose the certainty that she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) had been rude to Mrs. Wilcox.
Rudeness affected Margaret like a bitter taste in the
mouth. It poisoned life. At times it is necessary, but woe
to those who employ it without due need. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) flung on a hat
and shawl, just like a poor woman, and plunged into the fog,
which still continued. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) lips were compressed, the letter
remained in her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) hand, and in this state she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) crossed the
street, entered the marble vestibule of the flats, eluded
the concierges, and ran up the stairs till she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) reached the
second-floor.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) sent in her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) name, and to her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) surprise was shown
straight into Mrs. Wilcox's bedroom.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Mrs. Wilcox, I have made the baddest blunder. I am
more, more ashamed and sorry than I can say.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Wilcox/Mrs. Warrington/Wilcox</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Wilcox bowed gravely. She (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) was offended, and did
not pretend to the contrary. She (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) was sitting up in bed,
writing letters on an invalid table that spanned her (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) knees.
A breakfast tray was on another table beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>). The light
of the fire, the light from the window, and the light of a
candle-lamp, which threw a quivering halo round her (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) hands,
combined to create a strange atmosphere of dissolution.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I knew he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was going to India in November, but I forgot.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sailed on the 17th for Nigeria, in Africa.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I knew--I know. I have been too absurd all through. I
am very much ashamed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Wilcox/Mrs. Warrington/Wilcox</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Wilcox did not answer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am more sorry than I can say, and I hope that you
will forgive me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It doesn't matter, Miss Schlegel. It is good of you to
have come round so promptly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It does matter,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>cried Margaret. ``I have been rude to
you; and my sister is not even at home, so there was not
even that excuse.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) has just gone to Germany.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) gone as well,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>murmured the other. <div class="bookquote">``Yes,
certainly, it is quite safe--safe, absolutely, now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You've been worrying too!''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Margaret, getting
more and more excited, and taking a chair without
invitation. <div class="bookquote">``How perfectly extraordinary! I can see that
you have. You felt as I do; Helen mustn't meet him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I did think it best.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now why?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's a most difficult question,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Wilcox/Mrs. Warrington/Wilcox</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Wilcox,
smiling, and a little losing her (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) expression of annoyance.
<div class="bookquote">``I think you put it best in your letter--it was an instinct,
which may be wrong.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It wasn't that your son still--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh no; he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) often--my Paul is very young, you see.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then what was it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) repeated: <div class="bookquote">``An instinct which may be wrong.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In other words, they belong to types that can fall in
love, but couldn't live together. That's dreadfully
probable. I'm afraid that in nine cases out of ten Nature
pulls one way and human nature another.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``These are indeed `other words,'''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Wilcox/Mrs. Warrington/Wilcox</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Wilcox.<div class="bookquote">'' I
had nothing so coherent in my head. I was merely alarmed
when I knew that my boy cared for your sister.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Wilcox/Mrs. Warrington/Wilcox</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, I have always been wanting to ask you. How did you
know? Helen was so surprised when our aunt drove up, and
you stepped forward and arranged things. Did Paul tell you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There is nothing to be gained by discussing that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Wilcox/Mrs. Warrington/Wilcox</b></font>)</div>said
Mrs. Wilcox after a moment's pause.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Wilcox, were you very angry with us last June? I
wrote you a letter and you didn't answer it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I was certainly against taking Mrs. Matheson's flat. I
knew it was opposite your house.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But it's all right now?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You only think? You aren't sure? I do love these
little muddles tidied up?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh yes, I'm sure,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Wilcox/Mrs. Warrington/Wilcox</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Wilcox, moving with
uneasiness beneath the clothes. <div class="bookquote">``I always sound uncertain
over things. It is my way of speaking.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's all right, and I'm sure too.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the maid</b></font>)</div><p/>Here the maid came in to remove the breakfast-tray.
They were interrupted, and when they resumed conversation it
was on more normal lines.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I must say good-bye now--you will be getting up.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No--please stop a little longer--I am taking a day in
bed. Now and then I do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought of you as one of the early risers.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``At Howards End--yes; there is nothing to get up for in London.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing to get up for?''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>cried the scandalized
Margaret. <div class="bookquote">``When there are all the autumn exhibitions, and
Ysaye playing in the afternoon! Not to mention people.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The truth is, I am a little tired. First came the
wedding, and then Paul went off, and, instead of resting
yesterday, I paid a round of calls.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A wedding?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; Charles, my elder son, is married.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We took the flat chiefly on that account, and also that
Paul could get his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) African outfit. The flat belongs to a
cousin of my husband's, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) most kindly offered it to
us. So before the day came we were able to make the
acquaintance of Dolly's people, which we had not yet done.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div><p/>Margaret asked who Dolly's people were.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Fussell. The father is in the Indian army--retired;
the brother is in the army. The mother is dead.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>So perhaps these were the <div class="bookquote">``chinless sunburnt men''  (<font color='red'><b>Helen</b></font>)</div>whom
Helen had espied one afternoon through the window. Margaret
felt mildly interested in the fortunes of the Wilcox
family. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) had acquired the habit on Helen's account, and
it still clung to her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) asked for more information about
Miss Dolly Fussell that was, and was given it in even,
unemotional tones. Mrs. Wilcox's voice, though sweet and
compelling, had little range of expression. It suggested
that pictures, concerts, and people are all of small and
equal value. Only once had it quickened--when speaking of
Howards End.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Charles and Albert Fussell have known one another some
time. They belong to the same club, and are both devoted to
golf. Dolly plays golf too, though I believe not so well,
and they first met in a mixed foursome. We all like her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>),
and are very much pleased. They were married on the 11th, a
few days before Paul sailed. Charles was very anxious to
have his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) brother as best man, so he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) made a great point of
having it on the 11th. The Fussells would have preferred it
after Christmas, but they were very nice about it. There is
Dolly's photograph--in that double frame.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you quite certain that I'm not interrupting, Mrs. Wilcox?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, quite.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then I will stay. I'm enjoying this.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dolly</b></font>)</div><p/>Dolly's photograph was now examined. It was signed <div class="bookquote">``For
dear Mims,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Wilcox/Mrs. Warrington/Wilcox</b></font>)</div>which Mrs. Wilcox interpreted as <div class="bookquote">``the name she (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>)
and Charles had settled that she (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) should call me.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Wilcox/Mrs. Warrington/Wilcox</b></font>)</div>Dolly
looked silly, and had one of those triangular faces that so
often prove attractive to a robust man. She (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) was very
pretty. From her (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) Margaret passed to Charles, whose features
prevailed opposite. She (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) speculated on the forces that had
drawn the two together till God parted them. She (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) found time
to hope that they would be happy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They have gone to Naples for their honeymoon.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Lucky people!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can hardly imagine Charles in Italy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Doesn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) care for travelling?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) likes travel, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) does see through foreigners
so. What he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) enjoys most is a motor tour in England, and I
think that would have carried the day if the weather had not
been so abominable. His (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) father gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) a car of his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) own
for a wedding present, which for the present is being stored
at Howards End.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose you have a garage there?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. My husband built a little one only last month, to
the west of the house, not far from the wych-elm, in what
used to be the paddock for the pony.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The last words had an indescribable ring about them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where's the pony gone?''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>asked Margaret after a pause.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The pony? Oh, dead, ever so long ago.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``The wych-elm I
remember. Helen spoke of it as a very splendid tree.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is the finest wych-elm in Hertfordshire. Did your
sister tell you about the teeth?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, it might interest you. There are pigs' teeth stuck
into the trunk, about four feet from the ground. The
country people put them in long ago, and they think that if
they chew a piece of the bark, it will cure the toothache.
The teeth are almost grown over now, and no one comes to the
tree.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should. I love folklore and all festering superstitions.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you think that the tree really did cure toothache,
if one believed in it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course it did. It would cure anything--once.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly I remember cases--you see I lived at Howards
End long, long before Mr. Wilcox knew it. I was born there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The conversation again shifted. At the time it seemed
little more than aimless chatter. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) was interested when
her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) hostess explained that Howards End was her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) own
property. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) was bored when too minute an account was
given of the Fussell family, of the anxieties of Charles
concerning Naples, of the movements of Mr. Wilcox and Evie,
who were motoring in Yorkshire. Margaret could not bear
being bored. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) grew inattentive, played with the
photograph frame, dropped it, smashed Dolly's glass,
apologized, was pardoned, cut her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) finger thereon, was
pitied, and finally said she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) must be going--there was all
the housekeeping to do, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) had to interview Tibby's
riding-master.

<p/>Then the curious note was struck again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good-bye, Miss Schlegel, good-bye. Thank you for
coming. You have cheered me up.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm so glad!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I--I wonder whether you ever think about yourself.?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think of nothing else,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>said Margaret, blushing, but
letting her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) hand remain in that of the invalid.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wonder. I wondered at Heidelberg.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'M sure!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I almost think--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes?''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>asked Margaret, for there was a long pause--a
pause that was somehow akin to the flicker of the fire, the
quiver of the reading-lamp upon their hands, the white blur
from the window; a pause of shifting and eternal shadows.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I almost think you forget you're a girl.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div><p/>Margaret was startled and a little annoyed. <div class="bookquote">``I'm
twenty-nine,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) remarked. <div class="bookquote">``That not so wildly girlish.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Wilcox/Mrs. Warrington/Wilcox</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Wilcox smiled.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What makes you say that? Do you mean that I have been
gauche and rude?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>A shake of the head. <div class="bookquote">``I only meant that I am fifty-one,
and that to me both of you--Read it all in some book or
other; I cannot put things clearly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I've got it--inexperience. I'm no better than
Helen, you mean, and yet I presume to advise her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. You have got it. Inexperience is the word.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Inexperience,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>repeated Margaret, in serious yet
buoyant tones. <div class="bookquote">``Of course, I have everything to
learn--absolutely everything--just as much as Helen. Life's
very difficult and full of surprises. At all events, I've
got as far as that. To be humble and kind, to go straight
ahead, to love people rather than pity them, to remember the
submerged--well, one can't do all these things at once,
worse luck, because they're so contradictory. It's then
that proportion comes in--to live by proportion. Don't
BEGIN with proportion. Only prigs do that. Let proportion
come in as a last resource, when the better things have
failed, and a deadlock--Gracious me, I've started preaching!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed, you put the difficulties of life splendidly,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Wilcox/Mrs. Warrington/Wilcox</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Wilcox, withdrawing her (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) hand into the deeper
shadows. <div class="bookquote">``It is just what I should have liked to say about
them myself.''


 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Wilcox/Mrs. Warrington/Wilcox</b></font>)</div><p/>Chapter 9

<p/>Mrs. Wilcox cannot be accused of giving Margaret much
information about life. And Margaret, on the other hand,
has made a fair show of modesty, and has pretended to an
inexperience that she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) certainly did not feel. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) had kept
house for over ten years; she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) had entertained, almost with
distinction; she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) had brought up a charming sister, and was
bringing up a brother. Surely, if experience is attainable,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) had attained it.

<p/>Yet the little luncheon-party that she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) gave in Mrs.
Wilcox's honour was not a success. The new friend did not
blend with the <div class="bookquote">``one or two delightful people''  (<font color='red'><b>The friend</b></font>)</div>who had been
asked to meet her (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>), and the atmosphere was one of polite
bewilderment. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) tastes were simple, her (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) knowledge of
culture slight, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) was not interested in the New
English Art Club, nor in the dividing-line between
Journalism and Literature, which was started as a
conversational hare. The delightful people darted after it
with cries of joy, Margaret leading them, and not till the
meal was half over did they realize that the principal guest
had taken no part in the chase. There was no common topic.
Mrs. Wilcox, whose life had been spent in the service of
husband and sons, had little to say to strangers who had
never shared it, and whose age was half her (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) own. Clever
talk alarmed her (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>), and withered her (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) delicate imaginings; it
was the social; counterpart of a motorcar, all jerks, and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) was a wisp of hay, a flower. Twice she (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) deplored the
weather, twice criticized the train service on the Great
Northern Railway. They vigorously assented, and rushed on,
and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) inquired whether there was any news of Helen,
her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) hostess was too much occupied in placing Rothenstein to
answer. The question was repeated: <div class="bookquote">``I hope that your sister
is safe in Germany by now.''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>Margaret checked herself and
said, <div class="bookquote">``Yes, thank you; I heard on Tuesday.''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>But the demon of
vociferation was in her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>), and the next moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) was off again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Only on Tuesday, for they live right away at Stettin.
Did you ever know any one living at Stettin?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Wilcox/Mrs. Warrington/Wilcox</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Wilcox gravely, while her (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) neighbour,
a young man low down in the Education Office, began to
discuss what people who lived at Stettin ought to look
like. Was there such a thing as Stettininity? Margaret
swept on.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``People at Stettin drop things into boats out of
overhanging warehouses. At least, our cousins do, but
aren't particularly rich. The town isn't interesting,
except for a clock that rolls its eyes, and the view of the
Oder, which truly is something special. Oh, Mrs. Wilcox,
you would love the Oder! The river, or rather rivers--there
seem to be dozens of them--are intense blue, and the plain
they run through an intensest green.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed! That sounds like a most beautiful view, Miss Schlegel.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So I say, but Helen, who will muddle things, says no,
it's like music. The course of the Oder is to be like
music. It's obliged to remind her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) of a symphonic poem. The
part by the landing-stage is in B minor, if I remember
rightly, but lower down things get extremely mixed. There
is a slodgy theme in several keys at once, meaning
mud-banks, and another for the navigable canal, and the exit
into the Baltic is in C sharp major, pianissimo.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What do the overhanging warehouses make of that?''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>asked
the man, laughing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They make a great deal of it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>replied Margaret,
unexpectedly rushing off on a new track. ``I think it's
affectation to compare the Oder to music, and so do you, but
the overhanging warehouses of Stettin take beauty seriously,
which we don't, and the average Englishman doesn't, and
despises all who do. Now don't say <div class="bookquote">``Germans have no taste,''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>or I shall scream. They haven't. But--but--such a
tremendous but! --they take poetry seriously. They do take
poetry seriously.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is anything gained by that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Yes, yes. The German is always on the lookout for
beauty. He (<font color='blue'><b>German</b></font>) may miss it through stupidity, or misinterpret
it, but he (<font color='blue'><b>German</b></font>) is always asking beauty to enter his (<font color='blue'><b>German</b></font>) life, and I
believe that in the end it will come. At Heidelberg I met a
fat veterinary surgeon whose voice broke with sobs as he (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>)
repeated some mawkish poetry. So easy for me to laugh--I,
who never repeat poetry, good or bad, and cannot remember
one fragment of verse to thrill myself with. My blood
boils--well, I'm half German, so put it down to
patriotism--when I listen to the tasteful contempt of the
average islander for things Teutonic, whether they're
Bocklin or my veterinary surgeon. ``Oh, Bocklin,<div class="bookquote">'' they say;
`he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) strains after beauty, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) peoples Nature with gods too
consciously.''  (<font color='red'><b>Bocklin</b></font>)</div>Of course Bocklin strains, because he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wants
something--beauty and all the other intangible gifts that
are floating about the world. So his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) landscapes don't come
off, and Leader's do.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not sure that I agree. Do you?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), turning
to Mrs. Wilcox.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) replied: <div class="bookquote">``I think Miss Schlegel puts everything
splendidly'' (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>; and a chill fell on the conversation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Mrs. Wilcox, say something nicer than that. It's
such a snub to be told you put things splendidly. ''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not mean it as a snub. Your last speech
interested me so much. Generally people do not seem quite
to like Germany. I have long wanted to hear what is said on
the other side.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The other side? Then you do disagree. Oh, good! Give
us your side.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have no side. But my husband'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--her (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) voice softened,
the chill increased--<div class="bookquote">``has very little faith in the
Continent, and our children have all taken after him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``On what grounds? Do they feel that the Continent is in
bad form?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Wilcox/Mrs. Warrington/Wilcox</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Wilcox had no idea; she (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) paid little attention to
grounds. She (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) was not intellectual, nor even alert, and it
was odd that, all the same, she (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) should give the idea of
greatness. Margaret, zigzagging with her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) friends over
Thought and Art, was conscious of a personality that
transcended their own and dwarfed their activities. There
was no bitterness in Mrs. Wilcox; there was not even
criticism; she (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) was lovable, and no ungracious or
uncharitable word had passed her (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) lips. Yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) and daily
life were out of focus: one or the other must show blurred.
And at lunch she (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) seemed more out of focus than usual, and
nearer the line that divides life from a life that may be of
greater importance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You will admit, though, that the Continent--it seems
silly to speak of `the Continent,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>but really it is all more
like itself than any part of it is like England. England is
unique. Do have another jelly first. I was going to say
that the Continent, for good or for evil, is interested in
ideas. Its Literature and Art have what one might call the
kink of the unseen about them, and this persists even
through decadence and affectation. There is more liberty of
action in England, but for liberty of thought go to
bureaucratic Prussia. People will there discuss with
humility vital questions that we here think ourselves too
good to touch with tongs.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not want to go to Prussian''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Wilcox/Mrs. Warrington/Wilcox</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Wilcox--<div class="bookquote">``not
even to see that interesting view that you were describing.
And for discussing with humility I am too old. We never
discuss anything at Howards End.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Wilcox/Mrs. Warrington/Wilcox</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then you ought to!''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>said Margaret. <div class="bookquote">``Discussion keeps a
house alive. It cannot stand by bricks and mortar alone.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It cannot stand without them,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Wilcox/Mrs. Warrington/Wilcox</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Wilcox,
unexpectedly catching on to the thought, and rousing, for
the first and last time, a faint hope in the breasts of the
delightful people. <div class="bookquote">``It cannot stand without them, and I
sometimes think--But I cannot expect your generation to
agree, for even my daughter disagrees with me here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never mind us or her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>). Do say!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I sometimes think that it is wiser to leave action and
discussion to men.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>There was a little silence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``One admits that the arguments against the suffrage are
extraordinarily strong,''  (<font color='red'><b>girl</b></font>)</div>said a girl opposite, leaning
forward and crumbling her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) bread.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are they? I never follow any arguments. I am only too
thankful not to have a vote myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We didn't mean the vote, though, did we?''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>supplied
Margaret. <div class="bookquote">``Aren't we differing on something much wider,
Mrs. Wilcox? Whether women are to remain what they have
been since the dawn of history; or whether, since men have
moved forward so far, they too may move forward a little
now. I say they may. I would even admit a biological change.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know, I don't know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I must be getting back to my overhanging warehouse,''
 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the man. ``They've turned disgracefully strict.

<p/>Mrs. Wilcox also rose.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, but come upstairs for a little. Miss Quested
plays. Do you like MacDowell? Do you mind him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) only having
two noises? If you must really go, I'll see you out. Won't
you even have coffee?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Wilcox/Mrs. Warrington/Wilcox</b></font>)</div><p/>They left the dining-room, closing the door behind them,
and as Mrs. Wilcox buttoned up her (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) jacket, she (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) said: <div class="bookquote">``What
an interesting life you all lead in London!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, we don't,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>said Margaret, with a sudden revulsion.
<div class="bookquote">``We lead the lives of gibbering monkeys. Mrs.
Wilcox--really--We have something quiet and stable at the
bottom. We really have. All my friends have. Don't
pretend you enjoyed lunch, for you loathed it, but forgive
me by coming again, alone, or by asking me to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am used to young people,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Wilcox/Mrs. Warrington/Wilcox</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Wilcox, and with
each word she (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) spoke the outlines of known things grew dim.
<div class="bookquote">``I hear a great deal of chatter at home, for we, like you,
entertain a great deal. With us it is more sport and
politics, but--I enjoyed my lunch very much, Miss Schlegel,
dear, and am not pretending, and only wish I could have
joined in more. For one thing, I'm not particularly well
just today. For another, you younger people move so quickly
that it dazes me. Charles is the same, Dolly the same. But
we are all in the same boat, old and young. I never forget that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They were silent for a moment. Then, with a newborn
emotion, they shook hands. The conversation ceased suddenly
when Margaret re-entered the dining-room: her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) friends had
been talking over her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) new friend, and had dismissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) as
uninteresting.


<p/>Chapter 10

<p/>Several days passed.

<p/>Was Mrs. Wilcox one of the unsatisfactory people--there
are many of them--who dangle intimacy and then withdraw it?
They evoke our interests and affections, and keep the life
of the spirit dawdling round them. Then they withdraw.
When physical passion is involved, there is a definite name
for such behaviour--flirting--and if carried far enough it
is punishable by law. But no law--not public opinion
even--punishes those who coquette with friendship, though
the dull ache that they inflict, the sense of misdirected
effort and exhaustion, may be as intolerable. Was she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) one
of these?

<p/>Margaret feared so at first, for, with a Londoner's
impatience, she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) wanted everything to be settled up
immediately. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) mistrusted the periods of quiet that are
essential to true growth. Desiring to book Mrs. Wilcox as a
friend, she (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) pressed on the ceremony, pencil, as it were, in
hand, pressing the more because the rest of the family were
away, and the opportunity seemed favourable. But the elder
woman would not be hurried. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) refused to fit in with the
Wickham Place set, or to reopen discussion of Helen and
Paul, whom Margaret would have utilized as a short-cut. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
took her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) time, or perhaps let time take her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>), and when the
crisis did come all was ready.

<p/>The crisis opened with a message: would Miss Schlegel
come shopping? Christmas was nearing, and Mrs. Wilcox felt
behind-hand with the presents. She (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) had taken some more days
in bed, and must make up for lost time. Margaret accepted,
and at eleven o'clock one cheerless morning they started out
in a brougham.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``First of all,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>began Margaret, <div class="bookquote">``we must make a list and
tick off the people's names. My aunt always does, and this
fog may thicken up any moment. Have you any ideas?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought we would go to Harrod's or the Haymarket
Stores,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Wilcox/Mrs. Warrington/Wilcox</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Wilcox rather hopelessly. <div class="bookquote">``Everything is
sure to be there. I am not a good shopper. The din is so
confusing, and your aunt is quite right--one ought to make a
list. Take my notebook, then, and write your own name at
the top of the page.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, hooray!''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>said Margaret, writing it. <div class="bookquote">``How very kind
of you to start with me!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) did not want to receive
anything expensive. Their acquaintance was singular rather
than intimate, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) divined that the Wilcox clan would
resent any expenditure on outsiders; the more compact
families do. She (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) did not want to be thought a second Helen,
who would snatch presents since she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) could not snatch young
men, nor to be exposed, like a second Aunt Juley, to the
insults of Charles. A certain austerity of demeanour was
best, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) added: <div class="bookquote">``I don't really want a Yuletide gift,
though. In fact, I'd rather not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because I've odd ideas about Christmas. Because I have
all that money can buy. I want more people, but no more things.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should like to give you something worth your
acquaintance, Miss Schlegel, in memory of your kindness to
me during my lonely fortnight. It has so happened that I
have been left alone, and you have stopped me from
brooding. I am too apt to brood.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If that is so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>said Margaret, <div class="bookquote">``if I have happened to
be of use to you, which I didn't know, you cannot pay me
back with anything tangible.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">'' I suppose not, but one would like to. Perhaps I shall
think of something as we go about.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) name remained at the head of the list, but nothing
was written opposite it. They drove from shop to shop. The
air was white, and when they alighted it tasted like cold
pennies. At times they passed through a clot of grey. Mrs.
Wilcox's vitality was low that morning, and it was Margaret
who decided on a horse for this little girl, a golliwog for
that, for the rector's wife a copper warming-tray. <div class="bookquote">``We
always give the servants money.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, do you, yes, much
easier,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>replied Margaret, but felt the grotesque impact of
the unseen upon the seen, and saw issuing from a forgotten
manger at Bethlehem this torrent of coins and toys.
Vulgarity reigned. Public-houses, besides their usual
exhortation against temperance reform, invited men to <div class="bookquote">``Join
our Christmas goose club'' (<font color='red'><b>Public-houses men bottle</b></font>)</div>--one bottle of gin, etc., or two,
according to subscription. A poster of a woman in tights
heralded the Christmas pantomime, and little red devils, who
had come in again that year, were prevalent upon the
Christmas-cards. Margaret was no morbid idealist. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) did
not wish this spate of business and self-advertisement
checked. It was only the occasion of it that struck her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
with amazement annually. How many of these vacillating
shoppers and tired shop-assistants realized that it was a
divine event that drew them together? She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) realized it,
though standing outside in the matter. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) was not a
Christian in the accepted sense; she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) did not believe that
God had ever worked among us as a young artisan. These
people, or most of them, believed it, and if pressed, would
affirm it in words. But the visible signs of their belief
were Regent Street or Drury Lane, a little mud displaced, a
little money spent, a little food cooked, eaten, and
forgotten. Inadequate. But in public who shall express the
unseen adequately? It is private life that holds out the
mirror to infinity; personal intercourse, and that alone,
that ever hints at a personality beyond our daily vision.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I do like Christmas on the whole,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) announced.
<div class="bookquote">``In its clumsy way, it does approach Peace and Goodwill.
But oh, it is clumsier every year.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it? I am only used to country Christmases.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We are usually in London, and play the game with
vigour--carols at the Abbey, clumsy midday meal, clumsy
dinner for the maids, followed by Christmas-tree and dancing
of poor children, with songs from Helen. The drawing-room
does very well for that. We put the tree in the
powder-closet, and draw a curtain when the candles are
lighted, and with the looking-glass behind it looks quite
pretty. I wish we might have a powder-closet in our next
house. Of course, the tree has to be very small, and the
presents don't hang on it. No; the presents reside in a
sort of rocky landscape made of crumpled brown paper.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You spoke of your `next house,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Schlegel/Schlegel</b></font>)</div>Miss Schlegel. Then
are you leaving Wickham Place?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, in two or three years, when the lease expires. We
must.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you been there long?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``All our lives.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You will be very sorry to leave it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose so. We scarcely realize it yet. My
father--''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) broke off, for they had reached the stationery
department of the Haymarket Stores, and Mrs. Wilcox wanted
to order some private greeting cards.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If possible, something distinctive,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) sighed. At
the counter she (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) found a friend, bent on the same errand, and
conversed with her (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) insipidly, wasting much time. <div class="bookquote">``My
husband and our daughter are motoring.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Bertha too? Oh, fancy, what a coincidence!''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>Margaret,
though not practical, could shine in such company as this.
While they talked, she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) went through a volume of specimen
cards, and submitted one for Mrs. Wilcox's inspection. Mrs.
Wilcox was delighted--so original, words so sweet; she (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) would
order a hundred like that, and could never be sufficiently
grateful. Then, just as the assistant was booking the
order, she (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) said: <div class="bookquote">``Do you know, I'll wait. On second
thoughts, I'll wait. There's plenty of time still, isn't
there, and I shall be able to get Evie's opinion.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>They returned to the carriage by devious paths; when
they were in, she (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``But couldn't you get it renewed?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I beg your pardon?''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>asked Margaret.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The lease, I mean.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, the lease! Have you been thinking of that all the
time? How very kind of you!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Surely something could be done.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; values have risen too enormously. They mean to
pull down Wickham Place, and build flats like yours.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But how horrible!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Landlords are horrible.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) said vehemently: <div class="bookquote">``It is monstrous, Miss
Schlegel; it isn't right. I had no idea that this was
hanging over you. I do pity you from the bottom of my
heart. To be parted from your house, your father's
house--it oughtn't to be allowed. It is worse than dying.
I would rather die than--Oh, poor girls! Can what they call
civilization be right, if people mayn't die in the room
where they were born? My dear, I am so sorry--''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Margaret did not know what to say. Mrs. Wilcox had been
overtired by the shopping, and was inclined to hysteria.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Howards End was nearly pulled down once. It would have
killed me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Howards End must be a very different house to ours. We
are fond of ours, but there is nothing distinctive about
it. As you saw, it is an ordinary London house. We shall
easily find another.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So you think.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Again my lack of experience, I suppose!''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>said Margaret,
easing away from the subject. <div class="bookquote">``I can't say anything when
you take up that line, Mrs. Wilcox. I wish I could see
myself as you see me--foreshortened into a backfisch. Quite
the ingenue. Very charming--wonderfully well read for my
age, but incapable--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Wilcox/Mrs. Warrington/Wilcox</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Wilcox would not be deterred. <div class="bookquote">``Come down with me
to Howards End now,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) said, more vehemently than ever.
<div class="bookquote">``I want you to see it. You have never seen it. I want to
hear what you say about it, for you do put things so wonderfully.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div><p/>Margaret glanced at the pitiless air and then at the
tired face of her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) companion. <div class="bookquote">``Later on I should love it,''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) continued, <div class="bookquote">``but it's hardly the weather for such an
expedition, and we ought to start when we're fresh. Isn't
the house shut up, too?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) received no answer. Mrs. Wilcox appeared to be annoyed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Might I come some other day?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Wilcox/Mrs. Warrington/Wilcox</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Wilcox bent forward and tapped the glass. <div class="bookquote">``Back to
Wickham Place, please!''  (<font color='red'><b>the coachman</b></font>)</div>was her (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) order to the coachman.
Margaret had been snubbed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A thousand thanks, Miss Schlegel, for all your help.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not at all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is such a comfort to get the presents off my
mind--the Christmas-cards especially. I do admire your choice.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>It was her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) turn to receive no answer. In her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) turn
Margaret became annoyed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My husband and Evie will be back the day after
tomorrow. That is why I dragged you out shopping today. I
stayed in town chiefly to shop, but got through nothing, and
now he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) writes that they must cut their tour short, the
weather is so bad, and the police-traps have been so
bad--nearly as bad as in Surrey. Ours is such a careful
chauffeur, and my husband feels it particularly hard that
they should be treated like roadhogs.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, naturally he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)--he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) isn't a road-hog.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was exceeding the speed-limit, I conclude. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) must
expect to suffer with the lower animals.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Wilcox/Mrs. Warrington/Wilcox</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Wilcox was silenced. In growing discomfort they
drove homewards. The city seemed Satanic, the narrower
streets oppressing like the galleries of a mine. No harm
was done by the fog to trade, for it lay high, and the
lighted windows of the shops were thronged with customers.
It was rather a darkening of the spirit which fell back upon
itself, to find a more grievous darkness within. Margaret
nearly spoke a dozen times, but something throttled her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>).
She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) felt petty and awkward, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) meditations on Christmas
grew more cynical. Peace? It may bring other gifts, but is
there a single Londoner to whom Christmas is peaceful? The
craving for excitement and for elaboration has ruined that
blessing. Goodwill? Had she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) seen any example of it in the
hordes of purchasers? Or in herself. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) had failed to
respond to this invitation merely because it was a little
queer and imaginative--she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>), whose birthright it was to
nourish imagination! Better to have accepted, to have tired
themselves a little by the journey, than coldly to reply,
<div class="bookquote">``Might I come some other day?''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) cynicism left her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>).
There would be no other day. This shadowy woman would never
ask her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) again.

<p/>They parted at the Mansions. Mrs. Wilcox went in after
due civilities, and Margaret watched the tall, lonely figure
sweep up the hall to the lift. As the glass doors closed on
it she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) had the sense of an imprisonment. The beautiful head
disappeared first, still buried in the muff, the long
trailing skirt followed. A woman of undefinable rarity was
going up heaven-ward, like a specimen in a bottle. And into
what a heaven--a vault as of hell, sooty black, from which
soots descended!

<p/>At lunch her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) brother, seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) inclined for silence,
insisted on talking. Tibby was not ill-natured, but from
babyhood something drove him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) to do the unwelcome and the
unexpected. Now he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) gave her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) a long account of the
day-school that he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) sometimes patronized. The account was
interesting, and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had often pressed him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) for it before,
but she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) could not attend now, for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) mind was focussed on
the invisible. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) discerned that Mrs. Wilcox, though a
loving wife and mother, had only one passion in life--her (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>)
house--and that the moment was solemn when she (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) invited a
friend to share this passion with her (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>). To answer <div class="bookquote">``another
day''  (<font color='red'><b>a fool</b></font>)</div>was to answer as a fool. <div class="bookquote">``Another day''  (<font color='red'><b>Howards</b></font>)</div>will do for
brick and mortar, but not for the Holy of Holies into which
Howards End had been transfigured. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) own curiosity was
slight. She (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) had heard more than enough about it in the
summer. The nine windows, the vine, and the wych-elm had no
pleasant connections for her (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) would have preferred
to spend the afternoon at a concert. But imagination
triumphed. While her (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) brother held forth she (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) determined to
go, at whatever cost, and to compel Mrs. Wilcox to go, too.
When lunch was over she (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) stepped over to the flats.

<p/>Mrs. Wilcox had just gone away for the night.

<p/>Margaret said that it was of no consequence, hurried
downstairs, and took a hansom to King's Cross. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) was
convinced that the escapade was important, though it would
have puzzled her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) to say why. There was a question of
imprisonment and escape, and though she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) did not know the
time of the train, she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) strained her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) eyes for the St.
Pancras' clock.

<p/>Then the clock of King's Cross swung into sight, a
second moon in that infernal sky, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) cab drew up at the
station. There was a train for Hilton in five minutes. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
took a ticket, asking in her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) agitation for a single. As she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
did so, a grave and happy voice saluted her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) and thanked her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I will come if I still may,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>said Margaret, laughing nervously.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are coming to sleep, dear, too. It is in the
morning that my house is most beautiful. You are coming to
stop. I cannot show you my meadow properly except at
sunrise. These fogs'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) pointed at the station
roof--``never spread far. I dare say they are sitting in the
sun in Hertfordshire, and you will never repent joining them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall never repent joining you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is the same.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They began the walk up the long platform. Far at its
end stood the train, breasting the darkness without. They
never reached it. Before imagination could triumph, there
were cries of <div class="bookquote">``Mother! Mother!''  (<font color='red'><b>a girl</b></font>)</div>and a heavy-browed girl
darted out of the cloak-room and seized Mrs. Wilcox by the arm.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Evie!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) gasped. <div class="bookquote">``Evie, my pet--''

 (<font color='red'><b>The girl Father</b></font>)</div><p/>The girl called, <div class="bookquote">``Father! I say! look who's here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The girl Father</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Evie, dearest girl, why aren't you in Yorkshire?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No--motor smash--changed plans--Father's coming.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, Ruth!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wilcox/Wilcox</b></font>)</div>cried Mr. Wilcox, joining them. <div class="bookquote">``What in
the name of all that's wonderful are you doing here, Ruth?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Wilcox/Mrs. Warrington/Wilcox</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Wilcox had recovered herself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Henry dear! --here's a lovely surprise--but let me
introduce--but I think you know Miss Schlegel.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) replied, not greatly interested. <div class="bookquote">``But
how's yourself, Ruth?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Fit as a fiddle,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) answered gaily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So are we and so was our car, which ran A-1 as far as
Ripon, but there a wretched horse and cart which a fool of a
driver--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Schlegel, our little outing must be for another day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I was saying that this fool of a driver, as the
policeman himself admits--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Another day, Mrs. Wilcox. Of course.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">''--But as we've insured against third party risks, it
won't so much matter--''

 (<font color='red'><b>the family</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">''--Cart and car being practically at right angles--''

 (<font color='red'><b>the family</b></font>)</div><p/>The voices of the happy family rose high. Margaret was
left alone. No one wanted her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>). Mrs. Wilcox walked out of
King's Cross between her (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) husband and her (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) daughter, listening
to both of them.


<p/>Chapter 11

<p/>The funeral was over. The carriages rolled away through the
soft mud, and only the poor remained. They approached to
the newly-dug shaft and looked their last at the coffin, now
almost hidden beneath the spadefuls of clay. It was their
moment. Most of them were women from the dead woman's
district, to whom black garments had been served out by Mr.
Wilcox's orders. Pure curiosity had brought others. They
thrilled with the excitement of a death, and of a rapid
death, and stood in groups or moved between the graves, like
drops of ink. The son of one of them, a wood-cutter, was
perched high above their heads, pollarding one of the
churchyard elms. From where he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) sat he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) could see the village
of Hilton, strung upon the North Road, with its accreting
suburbs; the sunset beyond, scarlet and orange, winking at
him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) beneath brows of grey; the church; the plantations; and
behind him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) an unspoilt country of fields and farms. But he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>),
too, was rolling the event luxuriously in his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) mouth. He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)
tried to tell his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) mother down below all that he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) had felt
when he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) saw the coffin approaching: how he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) could not leave
his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) work, and yet did not like to go on with it; how he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) had
almost slipped out of the tree, he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) was so upset; the rooks
had cawed, and no wonder--it was as if rooks knew too. His (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)
mother claimed the prophetic power herself--she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had seen a
strange look about Mrs. Wilcox for some time. London had
done the mischief, said others. She (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) had been a kind lady;
her (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) grandmother had been kind, too--a plainer person, but
very kind. Ah, the old sort was dying out! Mr. Wilcox, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>)
was a kind gentleman. They advanced to the topic again and
again, dully, but with exaltation. The funeral of a rich
person was to them what the funeral of Alcestis or Ophelia
is to the educated. It was Art; though remote from life, it
enhanced life's values, and they witnessed it avidly.

<p/>The grave-diggers, who had kept up an undercurrent of
disapproval--they disliked Charles; it was not a moment to
speak of such things, but they did not like Charles
Wilcox--the grave-diggers finished their work and piled up
the wreaths and crosses above it. The sun set over Hilton:
the grey brows of the evening flushed a little, and were
cleft with one scarlet frown. Chattering sadly to each
other, the mourners passed through the lych-gate and
traversed the chestnut avenues that led down to the
village. The young wood-cutter stayed a little longer,
poised above the silence and swaying rhythmically. At last
the bough fell beneath his (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) saw. With a grunt, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) descended,
his (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) thoughts dwelling no longer on death, but on love, for
he (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) was mating. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) stopped as he (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) passed the new grave; a
sheaf of tawny chrysanthemums had caught his (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) eye. <div class="bookquote">``They
didn't ought to have coloured flowers at buryings,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>)
reflected. Trudging on a few steps, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) stopped again,
looked furtively at the dusk, turned back, wrenched a
chrysanthemum from the sheaf, and hid it in his (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) pocket.

<p/>After him (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) came silence absolute. The cottage that
abutted on the churchyard was empty, and no other house
stood near. Hour after hour the scene of the interment
remained without an eye to witness it. Clouds drifted over
it from the west; or the church may have been a ship,
high-prowed, steering with all its company towards
infinity. Towards morning the air grew colder, the sky
clearer, the surface of the earth hard and sparkling above
the prostrate dead. The wood-cutter, returning after a
night of joy, reflected: <div class="bookquote">``They lilies, they chrysants; it's
a pity I didn't take them all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The wood-cutter</b></font>)</div><p/>Up at Howards End they were attempting breakfast.
Charles and Evie sat in the dining-room, with Mrs. Charles.
Their father, who could not bear to see a face, breakfasted
upstairs. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) suffered acutely. Pain came over him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) in
spasms, as if it was physical, and even while he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was about
to eat, his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) eyes would fill with tears, and he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) would lay
down the morsel untasted.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) remembered his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) wife's even goodness during thirty
years. Not anything in detail--not courtship or early
raptures--but just the unvarying virtue, that seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
a woman's noblest quality. So many women are capricious,
breaking into odd flaws of passion or frivolity. Not so his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
wife. Year after year, summer and winter, as bride and
mother, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had been the same, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had always trusted her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>).
Her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) tenderness! Her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) innocence! The wonderful innocence
that was hers by the gift of God. Ruth knew no more of
worldly wickedness and wisdom than did the flowers in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruth</b></font>)
garden, or the grass in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruth</b></font>) field. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruth</b></font>) idea of
business--<div class="bookquote">``Henry, why do people who have enough money try to
get more money?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruth</b></font>) idea of politics--<div class="bookquote">``I am sure that if
the mothers of various nations could meet, there would be no
more wars.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruth</b></font>) idea of religion--ah, this had been a cloud,
but a cloud that passed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ruth</b></font>) came of Quaker stock, and he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)
and his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) family, formerly Dissenters, were now members of the
Church of England. The rector's sermons had at first
repelled her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruth</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruth</b></font>) had expressed a desire for <div class="bookquote">``a more
inward light,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>adding, <div class="bookquote">``not so much for myself as for baby''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>-LRB-Charles-RRB-. Inward light must have been granted, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
heard no complaints in later years. They brought up their
three children without dispute. They had never disputed.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ruth</b></font>) lay under the earth now. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ruth</b></font>) had gone, and as if to
make her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruth</b></font>) going the more bitter, had gone with a touch of
mystery that was all unlike her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruth</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Why didn't you tell me
you knew of it?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) had moaned, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruth</b></font>) faint voice had
answered: <div class="bookquote">``I didn't want to, Henry--I might have been
wrong--and every one hates illnesses.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) had been told of
the horror by a strange doctor, whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruth</b></font>) had consulted
during his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) absence from town. Was this altogether just?
Without fully explaining, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruth</b></font>) had died. It was a fault on
her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruth</b></font>) part, and--tears rushed into his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) eyes--what a little
fault! It was the only time she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruth</b></font>) had deceived him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) in those
thirty years.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) rose to his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) feet and looked out of the window, for
Evie had come in with the letters, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) could meet no
one's eye. Ah yes--she (<font color='blue'><b>Evie</b></font>) had been a good woman--she (<font color='blue'><b>Evie</b></font>) had been
steady. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) chose the word deliberately. To him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) steadiness
included all praise.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) himself, gazing at the wintry garden, is in
appearance a steady man. His (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) face was not as square as his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
son's, and, indeed, the chin, though firm enough in outline,
retreated a little, and the lips, ambiguous, were curtained
by a moustache. But there was no external hint of
weakness. The eyes, if capable of kindness and
goodfellowship, if ruddy for the moment with tears, were the
eyes of one who could not be driven. The forehead, too, was
like Charles's. High and straight, brown and polished,
merging abruptly into temples and skull, it has the effect
of a bastion that protected his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) head from the world. At
times it had the effect of a blank wall. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) had dwelt
behind it, intact and happy, for fifty years.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The post's come, Father,''  (<font color='red'><b>Evie/Evie Wilcox</b></font>)</div>said Evie awkwardly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thanks. Put it down.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Has the breakfast been all right?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, thanks.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The girl</b></font>)</div><p/>The girl glanced at him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) and at it with constraint. She (<font color='blue'><b>Evie</b></font>)
did not know what to do.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Charles says do you want the TIMES?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I'll read it later.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ring if you want anything, Father, won't you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I've all I want.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Having sorted the letters from the circulars, she (<font color='blue'><b>Evie</b></font>) went
back to the dining-room.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Father's eaten nothing,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Evie</b></font>) announced, sitting down
with wrinkled brows behind the tea-urn--

<p/>Charles did not answer, but after a moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) ran
quickly upstairs, opened the door, and said: <div class="bookquote">``Look here,
Father, you must eat, you know'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>; and having paused for a
reply that did not come, stole down again. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>)'s going to
read his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) letters first, I think,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) said evasively; <div class="bookquote">``I dare
say he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) will go on with his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) breakfast afterwards.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
took up the TIMES, and for some time there was no sound
except the clink of cup against saucer and of knife on plate.

<p/>Poor Mrs. Charles sat between her (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) silent companions,
terrified at the course of events, and a little bored. She (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
was a rubbishy little creature, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) knew it. A telegram
had dragged her (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) from Naples to the death-bed of a woman whom
she (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) had scarcely known. A word from her (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) husband had plunged
her (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) into mourning. She (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) desired to mourn inwardly as well,
but she (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) wished that Mrs. Wilcox, since fated to die, could
have died before the marriage, for then less would have been
expected of her (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>). Crumbling her (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) toast, and too nervous to
ask for the butter, she (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) remained almost motionless, thankful
only for this, that her (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) father-in-law was having his (<font color='blue'><b>father-in-law</b></font>)
breakfast upstairs.

<p/>At last Charles spoke. <div class="bookquote">``They had no business to be
pollarding those elms yesterday,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) said to his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) sister.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No indeed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I must make a note of that,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) continued. <div class="bookquote">``I am
surprised that the rector allowed it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps it may not be the rector's affair.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Whose else could it be?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The lord of the manor.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Impossible.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Butter, Dolly?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you, Evie dear. Charles--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, dear?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I didn't know one could pollard elms. I thought one
only pollarded willows.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh no, one can pollard elms.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then why oughtn't the elms in the churchyard to be pollarded?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charles/Wilcox/Charles Wilcox</b></font>)</div><p/>Charles frowned a little, and turned again to his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
sister. <div class="bookquote">``Another point. I must speak to Chalkeley.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Yes, rather; you must complain to Chalkeley.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's no good him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) saying he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) is not responsible for those
men. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) is responsible.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, rather.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Brother sister</b></font>)</div><p/>Brother and sister were not callous. They spoke thus,
partly because they desired to keep Chalkeley up to the
mark--a healthy desire in its way--partly because they
avoided the personal note in life. All Wilcoxes did. It
did not seem to them of supreme importance. Or it may be as
Helen supposed: they realized its importance, but were
afraid of it. Panic and emptiness, could one glance behind.
They were not callous, and they left the breakfast-table
with aching hearts. Their mother never had come in to
breakfast. It was in the other rooms, and especially in the
garden, that they felt her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) loss most. As Charles went out
to the garage, he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) was reminded at every step of the woman
who had loved him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) and whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) could never replace. What
battles he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) had fought against her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) gentle conservatism! How
she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had disliked improvements, yet how loyally she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had
accepted them when made! He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) father--what trouble
they had had to get this very garage! With what difficulty
had they persuaded her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to yield them to the paddock for
it--the paddock that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) loved more dearly than the garden
itself! The vine--she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had got her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) way about the vine. It
still encumbered the south wall with its unproductive
branches. And so with Evie, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Evie</b></font>) stood talking to the
cook. Though she (<font color='blue'><b>Evie</b></font>) could take up her (<font color='blue'><b>Evie</b></font>) mother's work inside the
house, just as the man could take it up without, she (<font color='blue'><b>Evie</b></font>) felt
that something unique had fallen out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Evie</b></font>) life. Their
grief, though less poignant than their father's, grew from
deeper roots, for a wife may be replaced; a mother never.

<p/>Charles would go back to the office. There was little
to do at Howards End. The contents of his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) mother's will had
been long known to them. There were no legacies, no
annuities, none of the posthumous bustle with which some of
the dead prolong their activities. Trusting her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) husband,
she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had left him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) everything without reserve. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was quite
a poor woman--the house had been all her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) dowry, and the
house would come to Charles in time. Her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) water-colours Mr.
Wilcox intended to reserve for Paul, while Evie would take
the jewellery and lace. How easily she (<font color='blue'><b>Evie</b></font>) slipped out of
life! Charles thought the habit laudable, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) did not
intend to adopt it himself, whereas Margaret would have seen
in it an almost culpable indifference to earthly fame.
Cynicism--not the superficial cynicism that snarls and
sneers, but the cynicism that can go with courtesy and
tenderness--that was the note of Mrs. Wilcox's will. She (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>)
wanted not to vex people. That accomplished, the earth
might freeze over her (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) for ever.

<p/>No, there was nothing for Charles to wait for. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) could
not go on with his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) honeymoon, so he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) would go up to London
and work--he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) felt too miserable hanging about. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) and Dolly
would have the furnished flat while his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) father rested
quietly in the country with Evie. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) could also keep an eye
on his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) own little house, which was being painted and
decorated for him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) in one of the Surrey suburbs, and in which
he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) hoped to install himself soon after Christmas. Yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
would go up after lunch in his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) new motor, and the town
servants, who had come down for the funeral, would go up by train.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) found his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) father's chauffeur in the garage, said,
<div class="bookquote">``Morning''  (<font color='red'><b>father chauffeur</b></font>)</div>without looking at the man's face, and, bending
over the car, continued: <div class="bookquote">``Hullo! my new car's been driven!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Has it, sir?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charles/Wilcox/Charles Wilcox</b></font>)</div>said Charles, getting rather red; <div class="bookquote">``and whoever's
driven it hasn't cleaned it properly, for there's mud on the
axle. Take it off.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charles/Wilcox/Charles Wilcox</b></font>)</div><p/>The man went for the cloths without a word. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) was a
chauffeur as ugly as sin--not that this did him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) disservice
with Charles, who thought charm in a man rather rot, and had
soon got rid of the little Italian beast with whom they had started.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Charles--''  (<font color='red'><b>bride</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) bride was tripping after him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) over the
hoar-frost, a dainty black column, her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) little face and
elaborate mourning hat forming the capital thereof.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``One minute, I'm busy. Well, Crane, who's been driving
it, do you suppose?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't know, I'm sure, sir. No one's driven it since
I've been back, but, of course, there's the fortnight I've
been away with the other car in Yorkshire.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The mud came off easily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Charles, your father's down. Something's happened. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
wants you in the house at once. Oh, Charles!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Wait, dear, wait a minute. Who had the key to the
garage while you were away, Crane?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The gardener, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you mean to tell me that old Penny can drive a motor?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, sir; no one's had the motor out, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then how do you account for the mud on the axle?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't, of course, say for the time I've been in
Yorkshire. No more mud now, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charles/Wilcox/Charles Wilcox</b></font>)</div><p/>Charles was vexed. The man was treating him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) as a fool,
and if his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) heart had not been so heavy he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) would have
reported him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) father. But it was not a morning for
complaints. Ordering the motor to be round after lunch, he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
joined his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) wife, who had all the while been pouring out some
incoherent story about a letter and a Miss Schlegel.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, Dolly, I can attend to you. Miss Schlegel? What
does she (<font color='blue'><b>Schlegel</b></font>) want?''

 (<font color='red'><b>people</b></font>)</div><p/>When people wrote a letter Charles always asked what
they wanted. Want was to him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) the only cause of action. And
the question in this case was correct, for his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) wife replied,
<div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Schlegel</b></font>) wants Howards End.''

 (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Howards End? Now, Crane, just don't forget to put on
the Stepney wheel.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, mind you don't forget, for I--Come, little woman.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the chauffeur</b></font>)</div>When they were out of the chauffeur's sight he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) put his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) arm
around her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) waist and pressed her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) against him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>). All his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
affection and half his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) attention--it was what he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) granted her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
throughout their happy married life.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But you haven't listened, Charles--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What's wrong?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I keep on telling you--Howards End. Miss Schlegels got
it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Got what?''  (<font color='red'><b>Charles/Wilcox/Charles Wilcox</b></font>)</div>asked Charles, unclasping her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``What the
dickens are you talking about?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, Charles, you promised not to say those naughty--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Look here, I'm in no mood for foolery. It's no morning
for it either.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I tell you--I keep on telling you--Miss Schlegel--she (<font color='blue'><b>Schlegel</b></font>)'s
got it--your mother's left it to her (<font color='blue'><b>Schlegel</b></font>)--and you've all got to
move out!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``HOWARDS END?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``HOWARDS END!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) screamed, mimicking him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>), and as she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
did so Evie came dashing out of the shrubbery.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dolly, go back at once! My father's much annoyed with
you. Charles'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--she (<font color='blue'><b>Evie</b></font>) hit herself wildly--<div class="bookquote">``come in at once to
Father. He (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>)'s had a letter that's too awful.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Charles began to run, but checked himself, and stepped
heavily across the gravel path. There the house was--the
nine windows, the unprolific vine. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) exclaimed, <div class="bookquote">``Schlegels
again!''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>and as if to complete chaos, Dolly said, <div class="bookquote">``Oh no, the
matron of the nursing home has written instead of her (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dolly</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Come in, all three of you!''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>cried his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) father, no longer
inert. <div class="bookquote">``Dolly, why have you disobeyed me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Mr. Wilcox--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I told you not to go out to the garage. I've heard you
all shouting in the garden. I won't have it. Come in.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) stood in the porch, transformed, letters in his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Into the dining-room, every one of you. We can't
discuss private matters in the middle of all the servants.
Here, Charles, here; read these. See what you make.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charles/Wilcox/Charles Wilcox</b></font>)</div><p/>Charles took two letters, and read them as he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) followed
the procession. The first was a covering note from the
matron. Mrs. Wilcox had desired her (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>), when the funeral
should be over, to forward the enclosed. The enclosed--it
was from his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) mother herself. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had written: <div class="bookquote">``To my
husband: I should like Miss Schlegel -LRB-Margaret-RRB- to have
Howards End.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose we're going to have a talk about this?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
remarked, ominously calm.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly. I was coming out to you when Dolly--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, let's sit down.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, Evie, don't waste time, sit down.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>In silence they drew up to the breakfast-table. The
events of yesterday--indeed, of this morning--suddenly
receded into a past so remote that they seemed scarcely to
have lived in it. Heavy breathings were heard. They were
calming themselves. Charles, to steady them further, read
the enclosure out loud: ``A note in my mother's handwriting,
in an envelope addressed to my father, sealed. Inside: ``I
should like Miss Schlegel -LRB-Margaret-RRB- to have Howards End.<div class="bookquote">''
No date, no signature. Forwarded through the matron of that
nursing home. Now, the question is--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Howards</b></font>)</div><p/>Dolly interrupted him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``But I say that note isn't
legal. Houses ought to be done by a lawyer, Charles, surely.''

 (<font color='red'><b>husband</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) husband worked his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) jaw severely. Little lumps
appeared in front of either ear--a symptom that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) had not
yet learnt to respect, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) asked whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) might see
the note. Charles looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) father for permission, who
said abstractedly, <div class="bookquote">``Give it her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) seized it, and at once
exclaimed: <div class="bookquote">``Why, it's only in pencil! I said so. Pencil
never counts.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We know that it is not legally binding, Dolly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wilcox/Wilcox</b></font>)</div>said
Mr. Wilcox, speaking from out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) fortress. <div class="bookquote">``We are
aware of that. Legally, I should be justified in tearing it
up and throwing it into the fire. Of course, my dear, we
consider you as one of the family, but it will be better if
you do not interfere with what you do not understand.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charles/Wilcox/Charles Wilcox</b></font>)</div><p/>Charles, vexed both with his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) father and his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) wife, then
repeated: <div class="bookquote">``The question is--''  (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) had cleared a space of the
breakfast-table from plates and knives, so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) could
draw patterns on the tablecloth. <div class="bookquote">``The question is whether
Miss Schlegel, during the fortnight we were all away,
whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Schlegel</b></font>) unduly--''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) stopped.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think that,''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) father, whose nature was
nobler than his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) son's

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't think what?''

 (<font color='red'><b>son</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That she (<font color='blue'><b>Schlegel</b></font>) would have--that it is a case of undue
influence. No, to my mind the question is the--the
invalid's condition at the time she (<font color='blue'><b>Schlegel</b></font>) wrote.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear father, consult an expert if you like, but I
don't admit it is my mother's writing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, you just said it was!''  (<font color='red'><b>Dolly</b></font>)</div>cried Dolly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Never mind if I did,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) blazed out; <div class="bookquote">``and hold your tongue.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The poor little wife coloured at this, and, drawing her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
handkerchief from her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) pocket, shed a few tears. No one
noticed her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>). Evie was scowling like an angry boy. The two
men were gradually assuming the manner of the
committee-room. They were both at their best when serving
on committees. They did not make the mistake of handling
human affairs in the bulk, but disposed of them item by
item, sharply. Calligraphy was the item before them now,
and on it they turned their well-trained brains. Charles,
after a little demur, accepted the writing as genuine, and
they passed on to the next point. It is the best--perhaps
the only--way of dodging emotion. They were the average
human article, and had they considered the note as a whole
it would have driven them miserable or mad. Considered item
by item, the emotional content was minimized, and all went
forward smoothly. The clock ticked, the coals blazed
higher, and contended with the white radiance that poured in
through the windows. Unnoticed, the sun occupied his (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) sky,
and the shadows of the tree stems, extraordinarily solid,
fell like trenches of purple across the frosted lawn. It
was a glorious winter morning. Evie's fox terrier, who had
passed for white, was only a dirty grey dog now, so intense
was the purity that surrounded him (<font color='blue'><b>terrier</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>terrier</b></font>) was discredited, but
the blackbirds that he (<font color='blue'><b>terrier</b></font>) was chasing glowed with Arabian
darkness, for all the conventional colouring of life had
been altered. Inside, the clock struck ten with a rich and
confident note. Other clocks confirmed it, and the
discussion moved towards its close.

<p/>To follow it is unnecessary. It is rather a moment when
the commentator should step forward. Ought the Wilcoxes to
have offered their home to Margaret? I think not. The
appeal was too flimsy. It was not legal; it had been
written in illness, and under the spell of a sudden
friendship; it was contrary to the dead woman's intentions
in the past, contrary to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) very nature, so far as that
nature was understood by them. To them Howards End was a
house: they could not know that to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) it had been a spirit,
for which she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) sought a spiritual heir. And--pushing one
step farther in these mists--may they not have decided even
better than they supposed? Is it credible that the
possessions of the spirit can be bequeathed at all? Has the
soul offspring? A wych-elm tree, a vine, a wisp of hay with
dew on it--can passion for such things be transmitted where
there is no bond of blood? No; the Wilcoxes are not to be
blamed. The problem is too terrific, and they could not
even perceive a problem. No; it is natural and fitting that
after due debate they should tear the note up and throw it
on to their dining-room fire. The practical moralist may
acquit them absolutely. He (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) who strives to look deeper may
acquit them--almost. For one hard fact remains. They did
neglect a personal appeal. The woman who had died did say
to them, <div class="bookquote">``Do this,''  (<font color='red'><b>The woman</b></font>)</div>and they answered, <div class="bookquote">``We will not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The woman</b></font>)</div><p/>The incident made a most painful impression on them.
Grief mounted into the brain and worked there
disquietingly. Yesterday they had lamented: <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was a dear
mother, a true wife: in our absence she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) neglected her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) health
and died.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Today they thought: <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was not as true, as
dear, as we supposed.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The desire for a more inward light
had found expression at last, the unseen had impacted on the
seen, and all that they could say was <div class="bookquote">``Treachery.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Wilcox/Mrs. Warrington/Wilcox</b></font>)</div>Mrs.
Wilcox had been treacherous to the family, to the laws of
property, to her (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) own written word. How did she (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) expect
Howards End to be conveyed to Miss Schlegel? Was her (<font color='blue'><b>Schlegel</b></font>)
husband, to whom it legally belonged, to make it over to her (<font color='blue'><b>Schlegel</b></font>)
as a free gift? Was the said Miss Schlegel to have a life
interest in it, or to own it absolutely? Was there to be no
compensation for the garage and other improvements that they
had made under the assumption that all would be theirs some
day? Treacherous! treacherous and absurd! When we think
the dead both treacherous and absurd, we have gone far
towards reconciling ourselves to their departure. That
note, scribbled in pencil, sent through the matron, was
unbusinesslike as well as cruel, and decreased at once the
value of the woman who had written it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, well!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wilcox/Wilcox</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Wilcox, rising from the table. <div class="bookquote">``I
shouldn't have thought it possible.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mother couldn't have meant it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Evie/Evie Wilcox</b></font>)</div>said Evie, still frowning.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, my girl, of course not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mother believed so in ancestors too--it isn't like her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>)
to leave anything to an outsider, who'd never appreciate. ''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The whole thing is unlike her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) announced. <div class="bookquote">``If Miss
Schlegel had been poor, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Schlegel</b></font>) had wanted a house, I could
understand it a little. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Schlegel</b></font>) has a house of her (<font color='blue'><b>Schlegel</b></font>) own.
Why should she (<font color='blue'><b>Schlegel</b></font>) want another? She (<font color='blue'><b>Schlegel</b></font>) wouldn't have any use of
Howards End.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That time may prove,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charles/Wilcox/Charles Wilcox</b></font>)</div>murmured Charles.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How?''  (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div>asked his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) sister.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Presumably she (<font color='blue'><b>Schlegel</b></font>) knows--mother will have told her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
got twice or three times into the nursing home. Presumably
she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) is awaiting developments.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What a horrid woman!''  (<font color='red'><b>Dolly</b></font>)</div>And Dolly, who had recovered,
cried, <div class="bookquote">``Why, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) may be coming down to turn us out now!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dolly</b></font>)</div><p/>Charles put her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) right. <div class="bookquote">``I wish she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) said
ominously. <div class="bookquote">``I could then deal with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So could I,''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>echoed his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) father, who was feeling rather
in the cold. Charles had been kind in undertaking the
funeral arrangements and in telling him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) to eat his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
breakfast, but the boy as he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) grew up was a little
dictatorial, and assumed the post of chairman too readily.
<div class="bookquote">``I could deal with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), if she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) comes, but she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) won't come.
You're all a bit hard on Miss Schlegel.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That Paul business was pretty scandalous, though.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I want no more of the Paul business, Charles, as I said

with the matron. I'm absolutely certain of it. Nor was she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
with the doctor. I'm equally certain of that. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) did not
hide anything from us, for up to that very afternoon she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) was

 (<font color='red'><b>Charles/Wilcox/Charles Wilcox</b></font>)</div><p/>Charles and his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) father sometimes disagreed. But they
always parted with an increased regard for one another, and
each desired no doughtier comrade when it was necessary to
voyage for a little past the emotions. So the sailors of
Ulysses voyaged past the Sirens, having first stopped one
another's ears with wool.


<p/>Chapter 12

<p/>Charles need not have been anxious. Miss Schlegel had never
heard of his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) mother's strange request. She (<font color='blue'><b>Schlegel</b></font>) was to hear of
it in after years, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Schlegel</b></font>) had built up her (<font color='blue'><b>Schlegel</b></font>) life
differently, and it was to fit into position as the
headstone of the corner. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Schlegel</b></font>) mind was bent on other
questions now, and by her (<font color='blue'><b>Schlegel</b></font>) also it would have been rejected
as the fantasy of an invalid.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Schlegel</b></font>) was parting from these Wilcoxes for the second
time. Paul and his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) mother, ripple and great wave, had
flowed into her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) life and ebbed out of it for ever. The
ripple had left no traces behind: the wave had strewn at her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
feet fragments torn from the unknown. A curious seeker, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
stood for a while at the verge of the sea that tells so
little, but tells a little, and watched the outgoing of this
last tremendous tide. Her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) friend had vanished in agony, but
not, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) believed, in degradation. Her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) withdrawal had
hinted at other things besides disease and pain. Some leave
our life with tears, others with an insane frigidity; Mrs.
Wilcox had taken the middle course, which only rarer natures
can pursue. She (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) had kept proportion. She (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) had told a little
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) grim secret to her (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) friends, but not too much; she (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) had
shut up her (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) heart--almost, but not entirely. It is thus, if
there is any rule, that we ought to die--neither as victim
nor as fanatic, but as the seafarer who can greet with an
equal eye the deep that he (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>) is entering, and the shore that
he (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>) must leave.

<p/>The last word--whatever it would be--had certainly not
been said in Hilton churchyard. She (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) had not died there. A
funeral is not death, any more than baptism is birth or
marriage union. All three are the clumsy devices, coming
now too late, now too early, by which Society would register
the quick motions of man. In Margaret's eyes Mrs. Wilcox
had escaped registration. She (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) had gone out of life vividly,
her (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) own way, and no dust was so truly dust as the contents
of that heavy coffin, lowered with ceremonial until it
rested on the dust of the earth, no flowers so utterly
wasted as the chrysanthemums that the frost must have
withered before morning. Margaret had once said she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``loved
superstition.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>It was not true. Few women had tried more
earnestly to pierce the accretions in which body and soul
are enwrapped. The death of Mrs. Wilcox had helped her (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) work. She (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) saw a little more clearly than hitherto what
a human being is, and to what he (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) may aspire. Truer
relationships gleamed. Perhaps the last word would be
hope--hope even on this side of the grave.

<p/>Meanwhile, she (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) could take an interest in the survivors.
In spite of her (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) Christmas duties, in spite of her (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) brother,
the Wilcoxes continued to play a considerable part in her (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>)
thoughts. She (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) had seen so much of them in the final week.
They were not <div class="bookquote">``her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) sort,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>they were often suspicious and
stupid, and deficient where she (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) excelled; but collision with
them stimulated her (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) felt an interest that verged
into liking, even for Charles. She (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) desired to protect them,
and often felt that they could protect her (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>), excelling where
she (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) was deficient. Once past the rocks of emotion, they
knew so well what to do, whom to send for; their hands were
on all the ropes, they had grit as well as grittiness, and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) valued grit enormously. They led a life that she (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) could
not attain to--the outer life of <div class="bookquote">``telegrams and anger,''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>which had detonated when Helen and Paul had touched in June,
and had detonated again the other week. To Margaret this
life was to remain a real force. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) could not despise it,
as Helen and Tibby affected to do. It fostered such virtues
as neatness, decision, and obedience, virtues of the second
rank, no doubt, but they have formed our civilization. They
form character, too; Margaret could not doubt it: they keep
the soul from becoming sloppy. How dare Schlegels despise
Wilcoxes, when it takes all sorts to make a world?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't brood too much,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) wrote to Helen, <div class="bookquote">``on the
superiority of the unseen to the seen. It's true, but to
brood on it is mediaeval. Our business is not to contrast
the two, but to reconcile them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Helen</b></font>)</div><p/>Helen replied that she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) had no intention of brooding on
such a dull subject. What did her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) sister take her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) for? The
weather was magnificent. She (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) and the Mosebachs had gone
tobogganing on the only hill that Pomerania boasted. It was
fun, but overcrowded, for the rest of Pomerania had gone
there too. Helen loved the country, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) letter glowed
with physical exercise and poetry. She (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) spoke of the
scenery, quiet, yet august; of the snow-clad fields, with
their scampering herds of deer; of the river and its quaint
entrance into the Baltic Sea; of the Oderberge, only three
hundred feet high, from which one slid all too quickly back
into the Pomeranian plains, and yet these Oderberge were
real mountains, with pine-forests, streams, and views
complete. <div class="bookquote">``It isn't size that counts so much as the way
things are arranged.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>In another paragraph she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) referred to
Mrs. Wilcox sympathetically, but the news had not bitten
into her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) had not realized the accessories of death,
which are in a sense more memorable than death itself. The
atmosphere of precautions and recriminations, and in the
midst a human body growing more vivid because it was in
pain; the end of that body in Hilton churchyard; the
survival of something that suggested hope, vivid in its turn
against life's workaday cheerfulness;--all these were lost
to Helen, who only felt that a pleasant lady could now be
pleasant no longer. She (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) returned to Wickham Place full of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) own affairs--she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) had had another proposal--and Margaret,
after a moment's hesitation, was content that this should be
so.

<p/>The proposal had not been a serious matter. It was the
work of Fraulein Mosebach, who had conceived the large and
patriotic notion of winning back her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) cousins to the
Fatherland by matrimony. England had played Paul Wilcox,
and lost; Germany played Herr Forstmeister someone--Helen
could not remember his (<font color='blue'><b>Forstmeister</b></font>) name.

<p/>Herr Forstmeister lived in a wood, and standing on the
summit of the Oderberge, he (<font color='blue'><b>Forstmeister</b></font>) had pointed out his (<font color='blue'><b>Forstmeister</b></font>) house to
Helen, or rather, had pointed out the wedge of pines in
which it lay. She (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) had exclaimed, <div class="bookquote">``Oh, how lovely! That's
the place for me!''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>and in the evening Frieda appeared in her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>)
bedroom. <div class="bookquote">``I have a message, dear Helen,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>etc., and so she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>)
had, but had been very nice when Helen laughed; quite
understood--a forest too solitary and damp--quite agreed,
but Herr Forstmeister believed he (<font color='blue'><b>Forstmeister</b></font>) had assurance to the
contrary. Germany had lost, but with good-humour; holding
the manhood of the world, she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) felt bound to win. <div class="bookquote">``And there
will even be someone for Tibby,''  (<font color='red'><b>Helen</b></font>)</div>concluded Helen. <div class="bookquote">``There
now, Tibby, think of that; Frieda is saving up a little girl
for you, in pig-tails and white worsted stockings, but the
feet of the stockings are pink, as if the little girl had
trodden in strawberries. I've talked too much. My head
aches. Now you talk.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tibby</b></font>)</div><p/>Tibby consented to talk. He (<font color='blue'><b>Forstmeister</b></font>) too was full of his (<font color='blue'><b>Forstmeister</b></font>) own
affairs, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Forstmeister</b></font>) had just been up to try for a scholarship at
Oxford. The men were down, and the candidates had been
housed in various colleges, and had dined in hall. Tibby
was sensitive to beauty, the experience was new, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Forstmeister</b></font>) gave
a description of his (<font color='blue'><b>Forstmeister</b></font>) visit that was almost glowing. The
august and mellow University, soaked with the richness of
the western counties that it has served for a thousand
years, appealed at once to the boy's taste: it was the kind
of thing he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) could understand, and he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) understood it all the
better because it was empty. Oxford is--Oxford: not a mere
receptacle for youth, like Cambridge. Perhaps it wants its
inmates to love it rather than to love one another: such at
all events was to be its effect on Tibby. His (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) sisters sent
him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) there that he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) might make friends, for they knew that his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
education had been cranky, and had severed him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) from other
boys and men. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) made no friends. His (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) Oxford remained
Oxford empty, and he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) took into life with him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), not the memory
of a radiance, but the memory of a colour scheme.

<p/>It pleased Margaret to hear her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) brother and sister
talking. They did not get on overwell as a rule. For a few
moments she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) listened to them, feeling elderly and benign.
Then something occurred to her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) interrupted:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Helen, I told you about poor Mrs. Wilcox; that sad business?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have had a correspondence with her (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) son. He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) was
winding up the estate, and wrote to ask me whether his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)
mother had wanted me to have anything. I thought it good of
him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>), considering I knew her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) so little. I said that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had
once spoken of giving me a Christmas present, but we both
forgot about it afterwards.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope Charles took the hint.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes--that is to say, her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) husband wrote later on, and
thanked me for being a little kind to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), and actually gave
me her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) silver vinaigrette. Don't you think that is
extraordinarily generous? It has made me like him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) very
much. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) hopes that this will not be the end of our
acquaintance, but that you and I will go and stop with Evie
some time in the future. I like Mr. Wilcox. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) is taking
up his (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) work--rubber--it is a big business. I gather he (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) is
launching out rather. Charles is in it, too. Charles is
married--a pretty little creature, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Evie</b></font>) doesn't seem
wise. They took on the flat, but now they have gone off to
a house of their own.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Helen</b></font>)</div><p/>Helen, after a decent pause, continued her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) account of
Stettin. How quickly a situation changes! In June she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) had
been in a crisis; even in November she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) could blush and be
unnatural; now it was January, and the whole affair lay
forgotten. Looking back on the past six months, Margaret
realized the chaotic nature of our daily life, and its
difference from the orderly sequence that has been
fabricated by historians. Actual life is full of false
clues and sign-posts that lead nowhere. With infinite
effort we nerve ourselves for a crisis that never comes.
The most successful career must show a waste of strength
that might have removed mountains, and the most unsuccessful
is not that of the man who is taken unprepared, but of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
who has prepared and is never taken. On a tragedy of that
kind our national morality is duly silent. It assumes that
preparation against danger is in itself a good, and that
men, like nations, are the better for staggering through
life fully armed. The tragedy of preparedness has scarcely
been handled, save by the Greeks. Life is indeed dangerous,
but not in the way morality would have us believe. It is
indeed unmanageable, but the essence of it is not a battle.
It is unmanageable because it is a romance, and its essence
is romantic beauty.

<p/>Margaret hoped that for the future she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) would be less
cautious, not more cautious, than she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) had been in the past.


<p/>Chapter 13

<p/>Over two years passed, and the Schlegel household continued
to lead its life of cultured but not ignoble ease, still
swimming gracefully on the grey tides of London. Concerts
and plays swept past them, money had been spent and renewed,
reputations won and lost, and the city herself, emblematic
of their lives, rose and fell in a continual flux, while her (<font color='blue'><b>Schlegel</b></font>)
shallows washed more widely against the hills of Surrey and
over the fields of Hertfordshire. This famous building had
arisen, that was doomed. Today Whitehall had been
transformed: it would be the turn of Regent Street
tomorrow. And month by month the roads smelt more strongly
of petrol, and were more difficult to cross, and human
beings heard each other speak with greater difficulty,
breathed less of the air, and saw less of the sky. Nature
withdrew: the leaves were falling by midsummer; the sun
shone through dirt with an admired obscurity.

<p/>To speak against London is no longer fashionable. The
Earth as an artistic cult has had its day, and the
literature of the near future will probably ignore the
country and seek inspiration from the town. One can
understand the reaction. Of Pan and the elemental forces,
the public has heard a little too much--they seem Victorian,
while London is Georgian--and those who care for the earth
with sincerity may wait long ere the pendulum swings back to
her (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) again. Certainly London fascinates. One visualizes it
as a tract of quivering grey, intelligent without purpose,
and excitable without love; as a spirit that has altered
before it can be chronicled; as a heart that certainly
beats, but with no pulsation of humanity. It lies beyond
everything: Nature, with all her (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) cruelty, comes nearer to us
than do these crowds of men. A friend explains himself: the
earth is explicable--from her (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) we came, and we must return to
her (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>). But who can explain Westminster Bridge Road or
Liverpool Street in the morning--the city inhaling--or the
same thoroughfares in the evening--the city exhaling her (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>)
exhausted air? We reach in desperation beyond the fog,
beyond the very stars, the voids of the universe are
ransacked to justify the monster, and stamped with a human
face. London is religion's opportunity--not the decorous
religion of theologians, but anthropomorphic, crude. Yes,
the continuous flow would be tolerable if a man of our own
sort--not anyone pompous or tearful--were caring for us up
in the sky.

<p/>The Londoner seldom understands his (<font color='blue'><b>Londoner</b></font>) city until it sweeps
him (<font color='blue'><b>Londoner</b></font>), too, away from his (<font color='blue'><b>Londoner</b></font>) moorings, and Margaret's eyes were
not opened until the lease of Wickham Place expired. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
had always known that it must expire, but the knowledge only
became vivid about nine months before the event. Then the
house was suddenly ringed with pathos. It had seen so much
happiness. Why had it to be swept away? In the streets of
the city she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) noted for the first time the architecture of
hurry, and heard the language of hurry on the mouths of its
inhabitants--clipped words, formless sentences, potted
expressions of approval or disgust. Month by month things
were stepping livelier, but to what goal? The population
still rose, but what was the quality of the men born? The
particular millionaire who owned the freehold of Wickham
Place, and desired to erect Babylonian flats upon it--what
right had he (<font color='blue'><b>Place</b></font>) to stir so large a portion of the quivering
jelly? He (<font color='blue'><b>Place</b></font>) was not a fool--she (<font color='blue'><b>millionaire</b></font>) had heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Place</b></font>) expose
Socialism--but true insight began just where his (<font color='blue'><b>Place</b></font>)
intelligence ended, and one gathered that this was the case
with most millionaires. What right had such men--But
Margaret checked herself. That way lies madness. Thank
goodness she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>), too, had some money, and could purchase a new home.

<p/>Tibby, now in his (<font color='blue'><b>Place</b></font>) second year at Oxford, was down for
the Easter vacation, and Margaret took the opportunity of
having a serious talk with him (<font color='blue'><b>Place</b></font>). Did he (<font color='blue'><b>Place</b></font>) at all know where he (<font color='blue'><b>Place</b></font>)
wanted to live? Tibby didn't know that he (<font color='blue'><b>Place</b></font>) did know. Did he (<font color='blue'><b>Place</b></font>)
at all know what he (<font color='blue'><b>Place</b></font>) wanted to do? He (<font color='blue'><b>Place</b></font>) was equally uncertain,
but when pressed remarked that he (<font color='blue'><b>Place</b></font>) should prefer to be quite
free of any profession. Margaret was not shocked, but went
on sewing for a few minutes before she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) replied:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I was thinking of Mr. Vyse. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vyse</b></font>) never strikes me as
particularly happy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ye-es,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tibby</b></font>)</div>said Tibby, and then held his (<font color='blue'><b>Place</b></font>) mouth open in a
curious quiver, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Place</b></font>), too, had thoughts of Mr. Vyse, had
seen round, through, over, and beyond Mr. Vyse, had weighed
Mr. Vyse, grouped him (<font color='blue'><b>Vyse</b></font>), and finally dismissed him (<font color='blue'><b>Vyse</b></font>) as having
no possible bearing on the subject under discussion. That
bleat of Tibby's infuriated Helen. But Helen was now down
in the dining-room preparing a speech about political
economy. At times her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) voice could be heard declaiming
through the floor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But Mr. Vyse is rather a wretched, weedy man, don't you
think? Then there's Guy. That was a pitiful business.
Besides'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--shifting to the general--<div class="bookquote">'' every one is the better
for some regular work.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Groans.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall stick to it,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) continued, smiling. <div class="bookquote">``I am
not saying it to educate you; it is what I really think. I
believe that in the last century men have developed the
desire for work, and they must not starve it. It's a new
desire. It goes with a great deal that's bad, but in itself
it's good, and I hope that for women, too, `not to work'
will soon become as shocking as `not to be married' was a
hundred years ago.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have no experience of this profound desire to which
you allude,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tibby</b></font>)</div>enunciated Tibby.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then we'll leave the subject till you do. I'm not
going to rattle you round. Take your time. Only do think
over the lives of the men you like most, and see how they've
arranged them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I like Guy and Mr. Vyse most,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tibby</b></font>)</div>said Tibby faintly, and
leant so far back in his (<font color='blue'><b>Vyse</b></font>) chair that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vyse</b></font>) extended in a
horizontal line from knees to throat.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And don't think I'm not serious because I don't use the
traditional arguments--making money, a sphere awaiting you,
and so on--all of which are, for various reasons, cant.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>)
sewed on. <div class="bookquote">``I'm only your sister. I haven't any authority
over you, and I don't want to have any. Just to put before
you what I think the truth. You see'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) shook off the
pince-nez to which she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) had recently taken--<div class="bookquote">``in a few years
we shall be the same age practically, and I shall want you
to help me. Men are so much nicer than women.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Labouring under such a delusion, why do you not marry?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I sometimes jolly well think I would if I got the chance.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Has nobody arst you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Only ninnies.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do people ask Helen?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Plentifully.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell me about them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell me about your ninnies, then.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They were men who had nothing better to do,''  (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>Vyse</b></font>)
sister, feeling that she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) was entitled to score this point.
``So take warning: you must work, or else you must pretend to
work, which is what I do. Work, work, work if you'd save
your soul and your body. It is honestly a necessity, dear
boy. Look at the Wilcoxes, look at Mr. Pembroke. With all
their defects of temper and understanding, such men give me
more pleasure than many who are better equipped and I think
it is because they have worked regularly and honestly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Spare me the Wilcoxes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Vyse</b></font>) moaned.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall not. They are the right sort.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, goodness me, Meg!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Vyse</b></font>) protested, suddenly sitting
up, alert and angry. Tibby, for all his (<font color='blue'><b>Vyse</b></font>) defects, had a
genuine personality.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, they're as near the right sort as you can imagine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no--oh, no!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I was thinking of the younger son, whom I once classed
as a ninny, but who came back so ill from Nigeria. He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)'s
gone out there again, Evie Wilcox tells me--out to his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) duty.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Duty''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>always elicited a groan.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) doesn't want the money, it is work he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) wants, though
it is beastly work--dull country, dishonest natives, an

produce men of that sort may well be proud. No wonder
England has become an Empire.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``EMPIRE!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't bother over results,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>said Margaret, a little
sadly. <div class="bookquote">``They are too difficult for me. I can only look at

the heroism that builds it up. London bores me, but what
thousands of splendid people are labouring to make London--''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What it is,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Vyse</b></font>) sneered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What it is, worse luck. I want activity without
civilization. How paradoxical! Yet I expect that is what
we shall find in heaven.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And I,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tibby</b></font>)</div>said Tibby, <div class="bookquote">``want civilization without
activity, which, I expect, is what we shall find in the
other place.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tibby</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You needn't go as far as the other place, Tibbi-kins,
if you want that. You can find it at Oxford.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Stupid--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If I'm stupid, get me back to the house-hunting. I'll
even live in Oxford if you like--North Oxford. I'll live
anywhere except Bournemouth, Torquay, and Cheltenham. Oh
yes, or Ilfracombe and Swanage and Tunbridge Wells and
Surbiton and Bedford. There on no account.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``London, then.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I agree, but Helen rather wants to get away from
London. However, there's no reason we shouldn't have a
house in the country and also a flat in town, provided we
all stick together and contribute. Though of course--Oh,
how one does maunder on, and to think, to think of the
people who are really poor. How do they live? Not to move
about the world would kill me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>As she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) spoke, the door was flung open, and Helen burst
in in a state of extreme excitement.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, my dears, what do you think? You'll never guess.
A woman's been here asking me for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) husband. Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) WHAT?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Helen</b></font>)</div>-LRB-Helen was fond of supplying her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) own surprise.-RRB- <div class="bookquote">``Yes, for
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) husband, and it really is so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not anything to do with Bracknell?''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>cried Margaret, who
had lately taken on an unemployed of that name to clean the
knives and boots.

<p/>``I offered Bracknell, and he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was rejected. So was
Tibby. -LRB-Cheer up, Tibby!-RRB- It's no one we know. I said,
``Hunt, my good woman; have a good look round, hunt under the
tables, poke up the chimney, shake out the antimacassars.
Husband? husband?<div class="bookquote">'' Oh, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) so magnificently dressed and
tinkling like a chandelier.''

 (<font color='red'><b>husband</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, Helen, what did happen really?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``What I say. I was, as it were, orating my speech.
Annie opens the door like a fool, and shows a female
straight in on me, with my mouth open. Then we began--very
civilly. ``I want my husband, what I have reason to believe
is here.'' No--how unjust one is. She (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) said ``whom,'' not
``what.'' She (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) got it perfectly. So I said, ``Name, please?''
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Lan, Miss,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>and there we were.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Lan?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Lan or Len. We were not nice about our vowels. Lanoline.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But what an extraordinary--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Lanoline</b></font>)</div><p/>``I said, <div class="bookquote">``My good Mrs. Lanoline, we have some grave
misunderstanding here. Beautiful as I am, my modesty is
even more remarkable than my beauty, and never, never has
Mr. Lanoline rested his (<font color='blue'><b>Lanoline</b></font>) eyes on mine.'''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope you were pleased,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tibby</b></font>)</div>said Tibby.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course,''  (<font color='red'><b>Helen</b></font>)</div>Helen squeaked. <div class="bookquote">``A perfectly delightful
experience. Oh, Mrs. Lanoline's a dear--she (<font color='blue'><b>Lanoline</b></font>) asked for a
husband as if he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was an umbrella. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lanoline</b></font>) mislaid him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) Saturday
afternoon--and for a long time suffered no inconvenience.
But all night, and all this morning her (<font color='blue'><b>Lanoline</b></font>) apprehensions grew.
Breakfast didn't seem the same--no, no more did lunch, and
so she (<font color='blue'><b>Lanoline</b></font>) strolled up to 2, Wickham Place as being the most
likely place for the missing article.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But how on earth--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Don't begin how on earthing. ``I know what I know,<div class="bookquote">'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>)
kept repeating, not uncivilly, but with extreme gloom. In
vain I asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) what she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) did know. Some knew what others
knew, and others didn't, and if they didn't, then others
again had better be careful. Oh dear, she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) was incompetent!
She (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) had a face like a silkworm, and the dining-room reeks of
orris-root. We chatted pleasantly a little about husbands,
and I wondered where hers was too, and advised her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) to go to
the police. She (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) thanked me. We agreed that Mr. Lanoline's
a notty, notty man, and hasn't no business to go on the
lardy-da. But I think she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) suspected me up to the last.
Bags I writing to Aunt Juley about this. Now, Meg,
remember--bags I.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Bag it by all means,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>murmured Margaret, putting down
her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) work. <div class="bookquote">``I'm not sure that this is so funny, Helen. It
means some horrible volcano smoking somewhere, doesn't it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think so--she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) doesn't really mind. The
admirable creature isn't capable of tragedy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) husband may be, though,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>said Margaret, moving to
the window.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, no, not likely. No one capable of tragedy could
have married Mrs. Lanoline.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Was she (<font color='blue'><b>Lanoline</b></font>) pretty?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Her (<font color='blue'><b>Lanoline</b></font>) figure may have been good once.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div><p/>The flats, their only outlook, hung like an ornate
curtain between Margaret and the welter of London. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
thoughts turned sadly to house-hunting. Wickham Place had
been so safe. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) feared, fantastically, that her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) own
little flock might be moving into turmoil and squalor, into
nearer contact with such episodes as these.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tibby and I have again been wondering where we'll live
next September,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) said at last.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tibby had better first wonder what he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)'ll do,''  (<font color='red'><b>Helen</b></font>)</div>retorted
Helen; and that topic was resumed, but with acrimony. Then
tea came, and after tea Helen went on preparing her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) speech,
and Margaret prepared one, too, for they were going out to a
discussion society on the morrow. But her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) thoughts were
poisoned. Mrs. Lanoline had risen out of the abyss, like a
faint smell, a goblin football, telling of a life where love
and hatred had both decayed.


<p/>Chapter 14

<p/>The mystery, like so many mysteries, was explained. Next
day, just as they were dressed to go out to dinner, a Mr.
Bast called. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bast</b></font>) was a clerk in the employment of the
Porphyrion Fire Insurance Company. Thus much from his (<font color='blue'><b>Bast</b></font>)
card. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bast</b></font>) had come <div class="bookquote">``about the lady yesterday.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>Thus much
from Annie, who had shown him (<font color='blue'><b>Bast</b></font>) into the dining-room.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Cheers, children!''  (<font color='red'><b>Helen</b></font>)</div>cried Helen. <div class="bookquote">``It's Mrs. Lanoline.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tibby</b></font>)</div><p/>Tibby was interested. The three hurried downstairs, to
find, not the gay dog they expected, but a young man,
colourless, toneless, who had already the mournful eyes
above a drooping moustache that are so common in London, and
that haunt some streets of the city like accusing
presences. One guessed him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) as the third generation,
grandson to the shepherd or ploughboy whom civilization had
sucked into the town; as one of the thousands who have lost
the life of the body and failed to reach the life of the
spirit. Hints of robustness survived in him (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>), more than a
hint of primitive good looks, and Margaret, noting the spine
that might have been straight, and the chest that might have
broadened, wondered whether it paid to give up the glory of
the animal for a tail coat and a couple of ideas. Culture
had worked in her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) own case, but during the last few weeks
she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) had doubted whether it humanized the majority, so wide
and so widening is the gulf that stretches between the
natural and the philosophic man, so many the good chaps who
are wrecked in trying to cross it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) knew this type very
well--the vague aspirations, the mental dishonesty, the
familiarity with the outsides of books. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) knew the very
tones in which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would address her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) was only
unprepared for an example of her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) own visiting-card.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You wouldn't remember giving me this, Miss Schlegel?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), uneasily familiar.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No; I can't say I do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, that was how it happened, you see.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Where did we meet, Mr. Bast? For the minute I don't remember.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It was a concert at the Queen's Hall. I think you will
recollect,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) added pretentiously, <div class="bookquote">``when I tell you that it
included a performance of the Fifth Symphony of Beethoven.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We hear the Fifth practically every time it's done, so
I'm not sure--do you remember, Helen?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Was it the time the sandy cat walked round the balustrade?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thought not.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then I don't remember. That's the only Beethoven I
ever remember specially.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you, if I may say so, took away my umbrella,
inadvertently of course.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Likely enough,''  (<font color='red'><b>Helen</b></font>)</div>Helen laughed, <div class="bookquote">``for I steal umbrellas
even oftener than I hear Beethoven. Did you get it back?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Helen</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, thank you, Miss Schlegel.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The mistake arose out of my card, did it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>interposed Margaret.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, the mistake arose--it was a mistake.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The lady who called here yesterday thought that you
were calling too, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) could find you?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>)
continued, pushing him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) forward, for, though he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had promised
an explanation, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) seemed unable to give one.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's so, calling too--a mistake.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then why--?''  (<font color='red'><b>Helen</b></font>)</div>began Helen, but Margaret laid a hand on
her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) arm.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I said to my wife,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) continued more rapidly--``I said
to Mrs. Bast, ``I have to pay a call on some friends,'' and
Mrs. Bast said to me, ``Do go.<div class="bookquote">'' While I was gone, however,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Bast</b></font>) wanted me on important business, and thought I had come
here, owing to the card, and so came after me, and I beg to
tender my apologies, and hers as well, for any inconvenience
we may have inadvertently caused you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>some friends</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No inconvenience,''  (<font color='red'><b>Helen</b></font>)</div>said Helen; <div class="bookquote">``but I still don't understand.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Helen</b></font>)</div><p/>An air of evasion characterized Mr. Bast. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bast</b></font>) explained
again, but was obviously lying, and Helen didn't see why he (<font color='blue'><b>Bast</b></font>)
should get off. She (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) had the cruelty of youth. Neglecting
her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) sister's pressure, she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I still don't understand.
When did you say you paid this call?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Call? What call?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Bast</b></font>), staring as if her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) question
had been a foolish one, a favourite device of those in mid-stream.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This afternoon call.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In the afternoon, of course!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bast</b></font>) replied, and looked at
Tibby to see how the repartee went. But Tibby, himself a
repartee, was unsympathetic, and said, <div class="bookquote">``Saturday afternoon
or Sunday afternoon?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tibby</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``S-Saturday.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Really!''  (<font color='red'><b>Helen</b></font>)</div>said Helen; <div class="bookquote">``and you were still calling on
Sunday, when your wife came here. A long visit.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Helen</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't call that fair,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bast</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bast, going scarlet
and handsome. There was fight in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bast</b></font>) eyes.<div class="bookquote">'' I know what
you mean, and it isn't so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, don't let us mind,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>said Margaret, distressed again
by odours from the abyss.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It was something else,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bast</b></font>) asserted, his (<font color='blue'><b>Bast</b></font>) elaborate
manner breaking down. <div class="bookquote">``I was somewhere else to what you
think, so there!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It was good of you to come and explain,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) said.
<div class="bookquote">``The rest is naturally no concern of ours.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, but I want--I wanted--have you ever read THE
ORDEAL OF RICHARD FEVEREL?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div><p/>Margaret nodded.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's a beautiful book. I wanted to get back to the
Earth, don't you see, like Richard does in the end. Or have
you ever read Stevenson's PRINCE OTTO?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Helen</b></font>)</div><p/>Helen and Tibby groaned gently.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's another beautiful book. You get back to the
Earth in that. I wanted--''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Bast</b></font>) mouthed affectedly. Then
through the mists of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bast</b></font>) culture came a hard fact, hard as a
pebble. <div class="bookquote">``I walked all the Saturday night,''  (<font color='red'><b>Leonard/Leonard Bast/Bast</b></font>)</div>said Leonard.
<div class="bookquote">``I walked.''  (<font color='red'><b>the sisters</b></font>)</div>A thrill of approval ran through the sisters.
But culture closed in again. He (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) asked whether they had ever
read E. V. Lucas's OPEN ROAD.

<p/>Said Helen, <div class="bookquote">``No doubt it's another beautiful book, but
I'd rather hear about your road.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Helen</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I walked.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How far?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know, nor for how long. It got too dark to see
my watch.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Were you walking alone, may I ask?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Said</b></font>) said, straightening himself; <div class="bookquote">``but we'd been
talking it over at the office. There's been a lot of talk
at the office lately about these things. The fellows there
said one steers by the Pole Star, and I looked it up in the
celestial atlas, but once out of doors everything gets so mixed--''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't talk to me about the Pole Star,''  (<font color='red'><b>Helen</b></font>)</div>interrupted
Helen, who was becoming interested. <div class="bookquote">``I know its little
ways. It goes round and round, and you go round after it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I lost it entirely. First of all the street
lamps, then the trees, and towards morning it got cloudy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tibby</b></font>)</div><p/>Tibby, who preferred his (<font color='blue'><b>Said</b></font>) comedy undiluted, slipped from
the room. He (<font color='blue'><b>Said</b></font>) knew that this fellow would never attain to
poetry, and did not want to hear him (<font color='blue'><b>Said</b></font>) trying. Margaret and
Helen remained. Their brother influenced them more than
they knew: in his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) absence they were stirred to enthusiasm
more easily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where did you start from?''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>cried Margaret. <div class="bookquote">``Do tell us
more.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``I took the Underground to Wimbledon. As I came out of
the office I said to myself, ``I must have a walk once in a
way. If I don't take this walk now, I shall never take it.<div class="bookquote">''
I had a bit of dinner at Wimbledon, and then--''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But not good country there, is it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It was gas-lamps for hours. Still, I had all the
night, and being out was the great thing. I did get into
woods, too, presently.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, go on,''  (<font color='red'><b>Helen</b></font>)</div>said Helen.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You've no idea how difficult uneven ground is when it's
dark.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did you actually go off the roads?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh yes. I always meant to go off the roads, but the
worst of it is that it's more difficult to find one's way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Bast, you're a born adventurer,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>laughed Margaret.
<div class="bookquote">``No professional athlete would have attempted what you've
done. It's a wonder your walk didn't end in a broken neck.
Whatever did your wife say?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Professional athletes never move without lanterns and
compasses,''  (<font color='red'><b>Helen</b></font>)</div>said Helen. <div class="bookquote">``Besides, they can't walk. It
tires them. Go on.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I felt like R. L. S. You probably remember how in
VIRGINIBUS--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, but the wood. This `ere wood. How did you get
out of it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I managed one wood, and found a road the other side
which went a good bit uphill. I rather fancy it was those
North Downs, for the road went off into grass, and I got
into another wood. That was awful, with gorse bushes. I
did wish I'd never come, but suddenly it got light--just
while I seemed going under one tree. Then I found a road
down to a station, and took the first train I could back to London.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But was the dawn wonderful?''  (<font color='red'><b>Helen</b></font>)</div>asked Helen.

<p/>With unforgettable sincerity he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) replied, <div class="bookquote">``No.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>The word
flew again like a pebble from the sling. Down toppled all
that had seemed ignoble or literary in his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) talk, down
toppled tiresome R. L. S. and the <div class="bookquote">``love of the earth''  (<font color='red'><b>R. L. S.</b></font>)</div>and
his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) silk top-hat. In the presence of these women Leonard
had arrived, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) spoke with a flow, an exultation, that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) had seldom known.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The dawn was only grey, it was nothing to mention--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Just a grey evening turned upside down. I know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">''--and I was too tired to lift up my head to look at it,
and so cold too. I'm glad I did it, and yet at the time it
bored me more than I can say. And besides--you can believe
me or not as you choose--I was very hungry. That dinner at
Wimbledon--I meant it to last me all night like other
dinners. I never thought that walking would make such a
difference. Why, when you're walking you want, as it were,
a breakfast and luncheon and tea during the night as well,
and I'd nothing but a packet of Woodbines. Lord, I did feel
bad! Looking back, it wasn't what you may call enjoyment.
It was more a case of sticking to it. I did stick. I--I
was determined. Oh, hang it all! what's the good--I mean,
the good of living in a room for ever? There one goes on
day after day, same old game, same up and down to town,
until you forget there is any other game. You ought to see
once in a way what's going on outside, if it's only nothing
particular after all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should just think you ought,''  (<font color='red'><b>Helen</b></font>)</div>said Helen, sitting on
the edge of the table.

<p/>The sound of a lady's voice recalled him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) from sincerity,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) said: <div class="bookquote">``Curious it should all come about from reading
something of Richard Jefferies.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Excuse me, Mr. Bast, but you're wrong there. It
didn't. It came from something far greater.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) could not stop him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>). Borrow was imminent after
Jefferies--Borrow, Thoreau, and sorrow. R. L. S. brought up
the rear, and the outburst ended in a swamp of books. No
disrespect to these great names. The fault is ours, not
theirs. They mean us to use them for sign-posts, and are
not to blame if, in our weakness, we mistake the sign-post
for the destination. And Leonard had reached the
destination. He (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) had visited the county of Surrey when
darkness covered its amenities, and its cosy villas had
re-entered ancient night. Every twelve hours this miracle
happens, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) had troubled to go and see for himself.
Within his (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) cramped little mind dwelt something that was
greater than Jefferies' books--the spirit that led Jefferies
to write them; and his (<font color='blue'><b>Jefferies</b></font>) dawn, though revealing nothing but
monotones, was part of the eternal sunrise that shows George
Borrow Stonehenge.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then you don't think I was foolish?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) asked, becoming
again the naive and sweet-tempered boy for whom Nature had
intended him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Heavens, no!''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>replied Margaret.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Heaven help us if we do!''  (<font color='red'><b>Helen</b></font>)</div>replied Helen.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm very glad you say that. Now, my wife would never
understand--not if I explained for days.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, it wasn't foolish!''  (<font color='red'><b>Helen</b></font>)</div>cried Helen, her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) eyes aflame.
<div class="bookquote">``You've pushed back the boundaries; I think it splendid of you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You've not been content to dream as we have--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Though we have walked, too--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I must show you a picture upstairs--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Here the door-bell rang. The hansom had come to take
them to their evening party.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, bother, not to say dash--I had forgotten we were
dining out; but do, do, come round again and have a talk.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, you must--do,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>echoed Margaret.

<p/>Leonard, with extreme sentiment, replied: <div class="bookquote">``No, I shall
not. It's better like this.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Leonard/Leonard Bast/Bast</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why better?''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>asked Margaret.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, it is better not to risk a second interview. I
shall always look back on this talk with you as one of the
finest things in my life. Really. I mean this. We can
never repeat. It has done me real good, and there we had
better leave it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's rather a sad view of life, surely.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Things so often get spoiled.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Helen</b></font>)</div>flashed Helen, <div class="bookquote">``but people don't.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Helen</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) could not understand this. He (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) continued in a vein
which mingled true imagination and false. What he (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) said
wasn't wrong, but it wasn't right, and a false note jarred.
One little twist, they felt, and the instrument might be in
tune. One little strain, and it might be silent for ever.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) thanked the ladies very much, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) would not call
again. There was a moment's awkwardness, and then Helen
said: <div class="bookquote">``Go, then; perhaps you know best; but never forget
you're better than Jefferies.''  (<font color='red'><b>Helen</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) went. Their hansom
caught him (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) up at the corner, passed with a waving of hands,
and vanished with its accomplished load into the evening.

<p/>London was beginning to illuminate herself against the
night. Electric lights sizzled and jagged in the main
thoroughfares, gas-lamps in the side streets glimmered a
canary gold or green. The sky was a crimson battlefield of
spring, but London was not afraid. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) smoke mitigated the
splendour, and the clouds down Oxford Street were a
delicately painted ceiling, which adorned while it did not
distract. She (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) has never known the clear-cut armies of the
purer air. Leonard hurried through her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) tinted wonders, very
much part of the picture. His (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) was a grey life, and to
brighten it he (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) had ruled off a few corners for romance. The
Miss Schlegels--or, to speak more accurately, his (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) interview
with them--were to fill such a corner, nor was it by any
means the first time that he (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) had talked intimately to
strangers. The habit was analogous to a debauch, an outlet,
though the worst of outlets, for instincts that would not be
denied. Terrifying him (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>), it would beat down his (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) suspicions
and prudence until he (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) was confiding secrets to people whom
he (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) had scarcely seen. It brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) many fears and some
pleasant memories. Perhaps the keenest happiness he (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) had
ever known was during a railway journey to Cambridge, where
a decent-mannered undergraduate had spoken to him (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>). They had
got into conversation, and gradually Leonard flung reticence
aside, told some of his (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) domestic troubles, and hinted at the
rest. The undergraduate, supposing they could start a
friendship, asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) to <div class="bookquote">``coffee after hall,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>which he (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>)
accepted, but afterwards grew shy, and took care not to stir
from the commercial hotel where he (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) lodged. He (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) did not want
Romance to collide with the Porphyrion, still less with
Jacky, and people with fuller, happier lives are slow to
understand this. To the Schlegels, as to the undergraduate,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) was an interesting creature, of whom they wanted to see
more. But they to him (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) were denizens of Romance, who must
keep to the corner he (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) had assigned them, pictures that must
not walk out of their frames.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) behaviour over Margaret's visiting-card had been
typical. His (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) had scarcely been a tragic marriage. Where
there is no money and no inclination to violence tragedy
cannot be generated. He (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) could not leave his (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) wife, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>)
did not want to hit her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>). Petulance and squalor were
enough. Here <div class="bookquote">``that card''  (<font color='red'><b>Leonard/Leonard Bast/Bast</b></font>)</div>had come in. Leonard, though
furtive, was untidy, and left it lying about. Jacky found
it, and then began, <div class="bookquote">``What's that card, eh?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jacky</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, don't you
wish you knew what that card was?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Len, who's Miss
Schlegel?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>etc.. Months passed, and the card, now as a joke,
now as a grievance, was handed about, getting dirtier and
dirtier. It followed them when they moved from Cornelia
Road to Tulse Hill. It was submitted to third parties. A
few inches of pasteboard, it became the battlefield on which
the souls of Leonard and his (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) wife contended. Why did he (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) not
say, <div class="bookquote">``A lady took my umbrella, another gave me this that I
might call for my umbrella'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>? Because Jacky would have
disbelieved him (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>)? Partly, but chiefly because he (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) was
sentimental. No affection gathered round the card, but it
symbolized the life of culture, that Jacky should never
spoil. At night he (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) would say to himself, <div class="bookquote">``Well, at all
events, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) doesn't know about that card. Yah! done her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) there!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Poor Jacky! she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was not a bad sort, and had a great
deal to bear. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) drew her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) own conclusion--she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was only
capable of drawing one conclusion--and in the fulness of
time she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) acted upon it. All the Friday Leonard had refused
to speak to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), and had spent the evening observing the
stars. On the Saturday he (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) went up, as usual, to town, but
he (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) came not back Saturday night nor Sunday morning, nor
Sunday afternoon. The inconvenience grew intolerable, and
though she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was now of a retiring habit, and shy of women,
she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) went up to Wickham Place. Leonard returned in her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
absence. The card, the fatal card, was gone from the pages
of Ruskin, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Ruskin</b></font>) guessed what had happened.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Ruskin</b></font>) had exclaimed, greeting her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) with peals of
laughter. <div class="bookquote">``I know where you've been, but you don't know
where I've been. ''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jacky</b></font>)</div><p/>Jacky sighed, said, <div class="bookquote">``Len, I do think you might explain,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Jacky</b></font>)</div>and resumed domesticity.

<p/>Explanations were difficult at this stage, and Leonard
was too silly--or it is tempting to write, too sound a chap
to attempt them. His (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) reticence was not entirely the shoddy
article that a business life promotes, the reticence that
pretends that nothing is something, and hides behind the
DAILY TELEGRAPH. The adventurer, also, is reticent, and it
is an adventure for a clerk to walk for a few hours in
darkness. You may laugh at him (<font color='blue'><b>adventurer</b></font>), you who have slept nights
on the veldt, with your rifle beside you and all the
atmosphere of adventure past. And you also may laugh who
think adventures silly. But do not be surprised if Leonard
is shy whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) meets you, and if the Schlegels rather
than Jacky hear about the dawn.

<p/>That the Schlegels had not thought him (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) foolish became a
permanent joy. He (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) was at his (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) best when he (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) thought of them.
It buoyed him (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) journeyed home beneath fading heavens.
Somehow the barriers of wealth had fallen, and there had
been--he (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) could not phrase it--a general assertion of the
wonder of the world. <div class="bookquote">``My conviction,''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>says the mystic,
<div class="bookquote">``gains infinitely the moment another soul will believe in
it,''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>and they had agreed that there was something beyond
life's daily grey. He (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) took off his (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) top-hat and smoothed it
thoughtfully. He (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) had hitherto supposed the unknown to be
books, literature, clever conversation, culture. One raised
oneself by study, and got upsides with the world. But in
that quick interchange a new light dawned. Was that
something'' walking in the dark among the surburban hills?

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) discovered that he (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) was going bareheaded down Regent
Street. London came back with a rush. Few were about at
this hour, but all whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) passed looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) with a
hostility that was the more impressive because it was
unconscious. He (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) put his (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) hat on. It was too big; his (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) head
disappeared like a pudding into a basin, the ears bending
outwards at the touch of the curly brim. He (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) wore it a
little backwards, and its effect was greatly to elongate the
face and to bring out the distance between the eyes and the
moustache. Thus equipped, he (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) escaped criticism. No one
felt uneasy as he (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) titupped along the pavements, the heart of
a man ticking fast in his (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) chest.


<p/>Chapter 15

<p/>The sisters went out to dinner full of their adventure, and
when they were both full of the same subject, there were few
dinner-parties that could stand up against them. This
particular one, which was all ladies, had more kick in it
than most, but succumbed after a struggle. Helen at one
part of the table, Margaret at the other, would talk of Mr.
Bast and of no one else, and somewhere about the entree
their monologues collided, fell ruining, and became common
property. Nor was this all. The dinner-party was really an
informal discussion club; there was a paper after it, read
amid coffee-cups and laughter in the drawing-room, but
dealing more or less thoughtfully with some topic of general
interest. After the paper came a debate, and in this debate
Mr. Bast also figured, appearing now as a bright spot in
civilization, now as a dark spot, according to the
temperament of the speaker. The subject of the paper had
been, <div class="bookquote">``How ought I to dispose of my money?''  (<font color='red'><b>the reader</b></font>)</div>the reader
professing to be a millionaire on the point of death,
inclined to bequeath her (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) fortune for the foundation of local
art galleries, but open to conviction from other sources.
The various parts had been assigned beforehand, and some of
the speeches were amusing. The hostess assumed the
ungrateful role of <div class="bookquote">``the millionaire's eldest son,''  (<font color='red'><b>The hostess</b></font>)</div>and
implored her (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>) expiring parent not to dislocate Society by
allowing such vast sums to pass out of the family. Money
was the fruit of self-denial, and the second generation had
a right to profit by the self-denial of the first. What
right had <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Bast''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>to profit? The National Gallery was
good enough for the likes of him (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>). After property had had
its say--a saying that is necessarily ungracious--the
various philanthropists stepped forward. Something must be
done for <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Bast'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>: his (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) conditions must be improved without
impairing his (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) independence; he (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) must have a free library, or
free tennis-courts; his (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) rent must be paid in such a way that
he (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) did not know it was being paid; it must be made worth his (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>)
while to join the Territorials; he (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) must be forcibly parted
from his (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) uninspiring wife, the money going to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) as
compensation; he (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) must be assigned a Twin Star, some member
of the leisured classes who would watch over him (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) ceaselessly
-LRB-groans from Helen-RRB-; he (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) must be given food but no clothes,
clothes but no food, a third-return ticket to Venice,
without either food or clothes when he (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) arrived there. In
short, he (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) might be given anything and everything so long as
it was not the money itself.

<p/>And here Margaret interrupted.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Order, order, Miss Schlegel!''  (<font color='red'><b>the reader</b></font>)</div>said the reader of the
paper. <div class="bookquote">``You are here, I understand, to advise me in the
interests of the Society for the Preservation of Places of
Historic Interest or Natural Beauty. I cannot have you
speaking out of your role. It makes my poor head go round,
and I think you forget that I am very ill.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Your head won't go round if only you'll listen to my
argument,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>said Margaret. <div class="bookquote">``Why not give him (<font color='blue'><b>Bast</b></font>) the money
itself. You're supposed to have about thirty thousand a year.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Have I? I thought I had a million.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Wasn't a million your capital? Dear me! we ought to
have settled that. Still, it doesn't matter. Whatever
you've got, I order you to give as many poor men as you can
three hundred a year each. ''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But that would be pauperizing them,''  (<font color='red'><b>an girl</b></font>)</div>said an earnest
girl, who liked the Schlegels, but thought them a little
unspiritual at times.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not if you gave them so much. A big windfall would not
pauperize a man. It is these little driblets, distributed
among too many, that do the harm. Money's educational.
It's far more educational than the things it buys.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>There
was a protest. <div class="bookquote">``In a sense,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>added Margaret, but the
protest continued. <div class="bookquote">``Well, isn't the most civilized thing
going, the man who has learnt to wear his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) income properly?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Exactly what your Mr. Basts won't do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Give them a chance. Give them money. Don't dole them
out poetry-books and railway-tickets like babies. Give them
the wherewithal to buy these things. When your Socialism
comes it may be different, and we may think in terms of
commodities instead of cash. Till it comes give people
cash, for it is the warp of civilization, whatever the woof
may be. The imagination ought to play upon money and
realize it vividly, for it's the--the second most important
thing in the world. It is so sluffed over and hushed up,
there is so little clear thinking--oh, political economy, of
course, but so few of us think clearly about our own private
incomes, and admit that independent thoughts are in nine
cases out of ten the result of independent means. Money:
give Mr. Bast money, and don't bother about his (<font color='blue'><b>Bast</b></font>) ideals.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Bast</b></font>)'ll pick up those for himself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) leant back while the more earnest members of the
club began to misconstrue her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>). The female mind, though
cruelly practical in daily life, cannot bear to hear ideals
belittled in conversation, and Miss Schlegel was asked
however she (<font color='blue'><b>Schlegel</b></font>) could say such dreadful things, and what it
would profit Mr. Bast if he (<font color='blue'><b>Bast</b></font>) gained the whole world and lost
his (<font color='blue'><b>Bast</b></font>) own soul. She (<font color='blue'><b>Schlegel</b></font>) answered, <div class="bookquote">``Nothing, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Bast</b></font>) would not gain
his (<font color='blue'><b>Bast</b></font>) soul until he (<font color='blue'><b>Bast</b></font>) had gained a little of the world.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>Then
they said, <div class="bookquote">``No they did not believe it,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and she (<font color='blue'><b>Schlegel</b></font>) admitted
that an overworked clerk may save his (<font color='blue'><b>Bast</b></font>) soul in the
superterrestrial sense, where the effort will be taken for
the deed, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Schlegel</b></font>) denied that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bast</b></font>) will ever explore the
spiritual resources of this world, will ever know the rarer
joys of the body, or attain to clear and passionate
intercourse with his (<font color='blue'><b>Bast</b></font>) fellows. Others had attacked the
fabric of Society-Property, Interest, etc.; she (<font color='blue'><b>Schlegel</b></font>) only fixed
her (<font color='blue'><b>Schlegel</b></font>) eyes on a few human beings, to see how, under present
conditions, they could be made happier. Doing good to
humanity was useless: the many-coloured efforts thereto
spreading over the vast area like films and resulting in an
universal grey. To do good to one, or, as in this case, to
a few, was the utmost she (<font color='blue'><b>Schlegel</b></font>) dare hope for.

<p/>Between the idealists, and the political economists,
Margaret had a bad time. Disagreeing elsewhere, they agreed
in disowning her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>), and in keeping the administration of the
millionaire's money in their own hands. The earnest girl
brought forward a scheme of <div class="bookquote">``personal supervision and mutual
help,''  (<font color='red'><b>The girl</b></font>)</div>the effect of which was to alter poor people until
they became exactly like people who were not so poor. The
hostess pertinently remarked that she (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>), as eldest son, might
surely rank among the millionaire's legatees. Margaret
weakly admitted the claim, and another claim was at once set
up by Helen, who declared that she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) had been the
millionaire's housemaid for over forty years, overfed and
underpaid; was nothing to be done for her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>), so corpulent and
poor? The millionaire then read out her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) last will and
testament, in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) left the whole of her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) fortune to the
Chancellor of the Exchequer. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) died. The serious
parts of the discussion had been of higher merit than the
playful--in a men's debate is the reverse more
general? --but the meeting broke up hilariously enough, and
a dozen happy ladies dispersed to their homes.

<p/>Helen and Margaret walked the earnest girl as far as
Battersea Bridge Station, arguing copiously all the way.
When she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) had gone they were conscious of an alleviation, and
of the great beauty of the evening. They turned back
towards Oakley Street. The lamps and the plane-trees,
following the line of the embankment, struck a note of
dignity that is rare in English cities. The seats, almost
deserted, were here and there occupied by gentlefolk in
evening dress, who had strolled out from the houses behind
to enjoy fresh air and the whisper of the rising tide.
There is something continental about Chelsea Embankment. It
is an open space used rightly, a blessing more frequent in
Germany than here. As Margaret and Helen sat down, the city
behind them seemed to be a vast theatre, an opera-house in
which some endless trilogy was performing, and they
themselves a pair of satisfied subscribers, who did not mind
losing a little of the second act.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Cold?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Tired?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Doesn't matter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The girl</b></font>)</div><p/>The earnest girl's train rumbled away over the bridge.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I say, Helen--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Are we really going to follow up Mr. Bast?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think we won't.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``As you like.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's no good, I think, unless you really mean to know
people. The discussion brought that home to me. We got on
well enough with him (<font color='blue'><b>Bast</b></font>) in a spirit of excitement, but think of
rational intercourse. We mustn't play at friendship. No,
it's no good.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There's Mrs. Lanoline, too,''  (<font color='red'><b>Helen</b></font>)</div>Helen yawned. <div class="bookquote">``So dull.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Just so, and possibly worse than dull.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should like to know how he (<font color='blue'><b>Bast</b></font>) got hold of your card.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But he (<font color='blue'><b>Bast</b></font>) said--something about a concert and an umbrella--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then did the card see the wife--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Helen, come to bed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, just a little longer, it is so beautiful. Tell me;
oh yes; did you say money is the warp of the world?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then what's the woof?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very much what one chooses,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>said Margaret. <div class="bookquote">``It's
something that isn't money--one can't say more.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Walking at night?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Probably.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``For Tibby, Oxford?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It seems so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``For you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now that we have to leave Wickham Place, I begin to
think it's that. For Mrs. Wilcox it was certainly Howards End.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>One's own name will carry immense distances. Mr.
Wilcox, who was sitting with friends many seats away, heard
his (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>), rose to his (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) feet, and strolled along towards the speakers.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is sad to suppose that places may ever be more
important than people,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>continued Margaret.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, Meg? They're so much nicer generally. I'd rather
think of that forester's house in Pomerania than of the fat
Herr Forstmeister who lived in it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I believe we shall come to care about people less and
less, Helen. The more people one knows the easier it
becomes to replace them. It's one of the curses of London.
I quite expect to end my life caring most for a place.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wilcox/Wilcox</b></font>)</div><p/>Here Mr. Wilcox reached them. It was several weeks
since they had met.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How do you do?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) cried. <div class="bookquote">``I thought I recognized your
voices. Whatever are you both doing down here?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) tones were protective. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) implied that one ought
not to sit out on Chelsea Embankment without a male escort.
Helen resented this, but Margaret accepted it as part of the
good man's equipment.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What an age it is since I've seen you, Mr. Wilcox. I
met Evie in the Tube, though, lately. I hope you have good
news of your son.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Paul?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wilcox/Wilcox</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Wilcox, extinguishing his (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) cigarette,
and sitting down between them. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, Paul's all right. We
had a line from Madeira. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)'ll be at work again by now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ugh--''  (<font color='red'><b>Helen</b></font>)</div>said Helen, shuddering from complex causes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I beg your pardon?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Isn't the climate of Nigeria too horrible?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Someone's got to go,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) said simply. <div class="bookquote">``England will
never keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Evie</b></font>) trade overseas unless she (<font color='blue'><b>Evie</b></font>) is prepared to make
sacrifices. Unless we get firm in West Africa, Ger--untold
complications may follow. Now tell me all your news.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, we've had a splendid evening,''  (<font color='red'><b>Helen</b></font>)</div>cried Helen, who
always woke up at the advent of a visitor. <div class="bookquote">``We belong to a
kind of club that reads papers, Margaret and I--all women,
but there is a discussion after. This evening it was on how
one ought to leave one's money--whether to one's family, or
to the poor, and if so how--oh, most interesting.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div><p/>The man of business smiled. Since his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife's death he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
had almost doubled his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) income. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was an important figure
at last, a reassuring name on company prospectuses, and life
had treated him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) very well. The world seemed in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) grasp as
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) listened to the River Thames, which still flowed inland
from the sea. So wonderful to the girls, it held no
mysteries for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had helped to shorten its long tidal
trough by taking shares in the lock at Teddington, and if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
and other capitalists thought good, some day it could be
shortened again. With a good dinner inside him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and an
amiable but academic woman on either flank, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) felt that his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
hands were on all the ropes of life, and that what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did
not know could not be worth knowing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sounds a most original entertainment!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) exclaimed,
and laughed in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pleasant way. ``I wish Evie would go to
that sort of thing. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Evie</b></font>) hasn't the time. She (<font color='blue'><b>Evie</b></font>)'s taken
to breed Aberdeen terriers--jolly little dogs.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I expect we'd better be doing the same, really.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We pretend we're improving ourselves, you see,''  (<font color='red'><b>Helen</b></font>)</div>said
Helen a little sharply, for the Wilcox glamour is not of the
kind that returns, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) had bitter memories of the days
when a speech such as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had just made would have impressed
her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) favourably. <div class="bookquote">``We suppose it is a good thing to waste an
evening once a fortnight over a debate, but, as my sister
says, it may be better to breed dogs.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not at all. I don't agree with your sister. There's
nothing like a debate to teach one quickness. I often wish
I had gone in for them when I was a youngster. It would
have helped me no end.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Quickness--?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. Quickness in argument. Time after time I've
missed scoring a point because the other man has had the
gift of the gab and I haven't. Oh, I believe in these discussions.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div><p/>The patronizing tone thought Margaret, came well enough
from a man who was old enough to be their father. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) had
always maintained that Mr. Wilcox had a charm. In times of
sorrow or emotion his (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) inadequacy had pained her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>), but it was
pleasant to listen to him (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) now, and to watch his (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) thick brown
moustache and high forehead confronting the stars. But
Helen was nettled. The aim of THEIR debates she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) implied was
Truth.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh yes, it doesn't much matter what subject you take,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>).

<p/>Margaret laughed and said, <div class="bookquote">``But this is going to be far
better than the debate itself.''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>Helen recovered herself and
laughed too. <div class="bookquote">``No, I won't go on,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) declared. <div class="bookquote">``I'll just
put our special case to Mr. Wilcox.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``About Mr. Bast? Yes, do. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bast</b></font>)'ll be more lenient to a
special case.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But, Mr. Wilcox, do first light another cigarette.
It's this. We've just come across a young fellow, who's
evidently very poor, and who seems interest--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What's his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) profession?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Clerk.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What in?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you remember, Margaret?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Porphyrion Fire Insurance Company.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Oh yes; the nice people who gave Aunt Juley a new
hearth-rug. He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) seems interesting, in some ways very, and
one wishes one could help him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) is married to a wife whom
he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) doesn't seem to care for much. He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) likes books, and what
one may roughly call adventure, and if he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) had a chance--But
he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) is so poor. He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) lives a life where all the money is apt
to go on nonsense and clothes. One is so afraid that
circumstances will be too strong for him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) and that he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) will
sink. Well, he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) got mixed up in our debate. He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) wasn't the
subject of it, but it seemed to bear on his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) point. Suppose
a millionaire died, and desired to leave money to help such
a man. How should he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) be helped? Should he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) be given three
hundred pounds a year direct, which was Margaret's plan?
Most of them thought this would pauperize him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). Should he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
and those like him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) be given free libraries? I said ``No!<div class="bookquote">'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>)
doesn't want more books to read, but to read books rightly.
My suggestion was he (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) should be given something every year
towards a summer holiday, but then there is his (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) wife, and
they said she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) would have to go too. Nothing seemed quite
right! Now what do you think? Imagine that you were a
millionaire, and wanted to help the poor. What would you do?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wilcox/Wilcox</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Wilcox, whose fortune was not so very far below the
standard indicated, laughed exuberantly. <div class="bookquote">``My dear Miss
Schlegel, I will not rush in where your sex has been unable
to tread. I will not add another plan to the numerous
excellent ones that have been already suggested. My only
contribution is this: let your young friend clear out of the
Porphyrion Fire Insurance Company with all possible speed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why?''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>said Margaret.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) lowered his (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) voice. <div class="bookquote">``This is between friends. It'll
be in the Receiver's hands before Christmas. It'll smash,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) added, thinking that she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) had not understood.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear me, Helen, listen to that. And he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)'ll have to get
another place!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Will have? Let him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) leave the ship before it sinks.
Let him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) get one now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Rather than wait, to make sure?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Decidedly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why's that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Again the Olympian laugh, and the lowered voice.
<div class="bookquote">``Naturally the man who's in a situation when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) applies
stands a better chance, is in a stronger position, than the
man who isn't. It looks as if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s worth something. I know
by myself---LRB-this is letting you into the State secrets-RRB---it
affects an employer greatly. Human nature, I'm afraid.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hadn't thought of that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>murmured Margaret, while
Helen said, <div class="bookquote">``Our human nature appears to be the other way
round. We employ people because they're unemployed. The
boot man, for instance.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Helen</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And how does he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) clean the boots?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>confessed Margaret.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There you are!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then do you really advise us to tell this youth--''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I advise nothing,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) interrupted, glancing up and down
the Embankment, in case his (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) indiscretion had been
overheard. <div class="bookquote">``I oughtn't to have spoken--but I happen to
know, being more or less behind the scenes. The
Porphyrion's a bad, bad concern--Now, don't say I said so.
It's outside the Tariff Ring.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly I won't say. In fact, I don't know what that
means.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought an insurance company never smashed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Helen</b></font>)</div>was
Helen's contribution. <div class="bookquote">``Don't the others always run in and
save them?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You're thinking of reinsurance,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wilcox/Wilcox</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Wilcox
mildly. <div class="bookquote">``It is exactly there that the Porphyrion is weak.
It has tried to undercut, has been badly hit by a long
series of small fires, and it hasn't been able to reinsure.
I'm afraid that public companies don't save one another for love.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">''`Human nature,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I suppose,'' quoted Helen, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>)
laughed and agreed that it was. When Margaret said that she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
supposed that clerks, like every one else, found it
extremely difficult to get situations in these days, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>)
replied, <div class="bookquote">``Yes, extremely,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>and rose to rejoin his (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) friends.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) knew by his (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) own office--seldom a vacant post, and
hundreds of applicants for it; at present no vacant post.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And how's Howards End looking?''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>said Margaret, wishing
to change the subject before they parted. Mr. Wilcox was a
little apt to think one wanted to get something out of him (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's let.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Really. And you wandering homeless in long-haired
Chelsea? How strange are the ways of Fate!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; it's let unfurnished. We've moved.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, I thought of you both as anchored there for ever.
Evie never told me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I dare say when you met Evie the thing wasn't settled.
We only moved a week ago. Paul has rather a feeling for the
old place, and we held on for him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) to have his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) holiday there;
but, really, it is impossibly small. Endless drawbacks. I
forget whether you've been up to it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``As far as the house, never.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, Howards End is one of those converted farms.
They don't really do, spend what you will on them. We
messed away with a garage all among the wych-elm roots, and
last year we enclosed a bit of the meadow and attempted a
mockery. Evie got rather keen on Alpine plants. But it
didn't do--no, it didn't do. You remember, or your sister
will remember, the farm with those abominable guinea-fowls,
and the hedge that the old woman never would cut properly,
so that it all went thin at the bottom. And, inside the
house, the beams--and the staircase through a
door--picturesque enough, but not a place to live in.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>)
glanced over the parapet cheerfully. <div class="bookquote">``Full tide. And the
position wasn't right either. The neighbourhood's getting
suburban. Either be in London or out of it, I say; so we've
taken a house in Ducie Street, close to Sloane Street, and a
place right down in Shropshire--Oniton Grange. Ever heard
of Oniton? Do come and see us--right away from everywhere,
up towards Wales. ''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What a change!''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>said Margaret. But the change was in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) own voice, which had become most sad. <div class="bookquote">``I can't imagine
Howards End or Hilton without you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hilton isn't without us,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) replied. <div class="bookquote">``Charles is
there still.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Still?''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>said Margaret, who had not kept up with the
Charles'. <div class="bookquote">``But I thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) was still at Epsom. They were
furnishing that Christmas--one Christmas. How everything
alters! I used to admire Mrs. Charles from our windows very
often. Wasn't it Epsom?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, but they moved eighteen months ago. Charles, the
good chap'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) voice dropped--<div class="bookquote">``thought I should be lonely.
I didn't want him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) to move, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) would, and took a house at
the other end of Hilton, down by the Six Hills. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hilton</b></font>) had a
motor, too. There they all are, a very jolly party--he (<font color='blue'><b>Hilton</b></font>) and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) and the two grandchildren.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I manage other people's affairs so much better than
they manage them themselves,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>said Margaret as they shook
hands. <div class="bookquote">``When you moved out of Howards End, I should have
moved Mr. Charles Wilcox into it. I should have kept so
remarkable a place in the family.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So it is,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) replied. <div class="bookquote">``I haven't sold it, and don't
mean to.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; but none of you are there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, we've got a splendid tenant--Hamar Bryce, an
invalid. If Charles ever wanted it--but he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) won't. Dolly is
so dependent on modern conveniences. No, we have all
decided against Howards End. We like it in a way, but now
we feel that it is neither one thing nor the other. One
must have one thing or the other.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And some people are lucky enough to have both. You're
doing yourself proud, Mr. Wilcox. My congratulations.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And mine,''  (<font color='red'><b>Helen</b></font>)</div>said Helen.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do remind Evie to come and see us--two, Wickham Place.
We shan't be there very long, either.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You, too, on the move?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Next September,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>Margaret sighed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Every one moving! Good-bye.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The tide had begun to ebb. Margaret leant over the
parapet and watched it sadly. Mr. Wilcox had forgotten his (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>)
wife, Helen her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) lover; she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) herself was probably forgetting.
Every one moving. Is it worth while attempting the past
when there is this continual flux even in the hearts of men?

<p/>Helen roused her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) by saying: <div class="bookquote">``What a prosperous vulgarian
Mr. Wilcox has grown! I have very little use for him (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) in
these days. However, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) did tell us about the Porphyrion.
Let us write to Mr. Bast as soon as ever we get home, and
tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Bast</b></font>) to clear out of it at once.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Helen</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do; yes, that's worth doing. Let us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Let's ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Bast</b></font>) to tea.''


 (<font color='red'><b>Leonard/Leonard Bast/Bast</b></font>)</div><p/>Chapter 16

<p/>Leonard accepted the invitation to tea next Saturday. But
he (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) was right; the visit proved a conspicuous failure.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sugar?''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>said Margaret.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Cake?''  (<font color='red'><b>Helen</b></font>)</div>said Helen. <div class="bookquote">``The big cake or the little
deadlies? I'm afraid you thought my letter rather odd, but
we'll explain--we aren't odd, really--not affected, really.
We're over-expressive: that's all. ''

 (<font color='red'><b>a lady</b></font>)</div><p/>As a lady's lap-dog Leonard did not excel. He (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) was not
an Italian, still less a Frenchman, in whose blood there
runs the very spirit of persiflage and of gracious
repartee. His (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) wit was the Cockney's; it opened no doors
into imagination, and Helen was drawn up short by <div class="bookquote">``The more
a lady has to say, the better,''  (<font color='red'><b>Helen</b></font>)</div>administered waggishly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ladies brighten--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I know. The darlings are regular sunbeams. Let
me give you a plate.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How do you like your work?''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>interposed Margaret.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>), too, was drawn up short. He (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) would not have these
women prying into his (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) work. They were Romance, and so was
the room to which he (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) had at last penetrated, with the queer
sketches of people bathing upon its walls, and so were the
very tea-cups, with their delicate borders of wild
strawberries. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) would not let Romance interfere with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) life. There is the devil to pay then.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, well enough,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) answered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your company is the Porphyrion, isn't it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, that's so'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--becoming rather offended. <div class="bookquote">``It's funny
how things get round.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why funny?''  (<font color='red'><b>Helen</b></font>)</div>asked Helen, who did not follow the
workings of his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) mind. <div class="bookquote">``It was written as large as life on
your card, and considering we wrote to you there, and that
you replied on the stamped paper--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Would you call the Porphyrion one of the big Insurance
Companies?''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>pursued Margaret.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It depends what you call big.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I mean by big, a solid, well-established concern, that
offers a reasonably good career to its employes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I couldn't say--some would tell you one thing and
others another,''  (<font color='red'><b>the employe</b></font>)</div>said the employe uneasily. <div class="bookquote">``For my own
part'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) shook his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) head--<div class="bookquote">``I only believe half I hear. Not
that even; it's safer. Those clever ones come to the worse
grief, I've often noticed. Ah, you can't be too careful.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) drank, and wiped his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) moustache, which was going to be
one of those moustaches that always droop into
tea-cups--more bother than they're worth, surely, and not
fashionable either.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I quite agree, and that's why I was curious to know: is
it a solid, well-established concern?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Leonard/Leonard Bast/Bast</b></font>)</div><p/>Leonard had no idea. He (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) understood his (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) own corner of
the machine, but nothing beyond it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) desired to confess
neither knowledge nor ignorance, and under these
circumstances, another motion of the head seemed safest. To
him (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>), as to the British public, the Porphyrion was the
Porphyrion of the advertisement--a giant, in the classical
style, but draped sufficiently, who held in one hand a
burning torch, and pointed with the other to St. Paul's and
Windsor Castle. A large sum of money was inscribed below,
and you drew your own conclusions. This giant caused
Leonard to do arithmetic and write letters, to explain the
regulations to new clients, and re-explain them to old
ones. A giant was of an impulsive morality--one knew that
much. He (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) would pay for Mrs. Munt's hearth-rug with
ostentatious haste, a large claim he (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) would repudiate
quietly, and fight court by court. But his (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) true fighting
weight, his (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) antecedents, his (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) amours with other members of
the commercial Pantheon--all these were as uncertain to
ordinary mortals as were the escapades of Zeus. While the
gods are powerful, we learn little about them. It is only
in the days of their decadence that a strong light beats
into heaven.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We were told the Porphyrion's no go,''  (<font color='red'><b>Helen</b></font>)</div>blurted Helen.
<div class="bookquote">``We wanted to tell you; that's why we wrote.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A friend of ours did think that it is unsufficiently
reinsured,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>said Margaret.

<p/>Now Leonard had his (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) clue. He (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) must praise the
Porphyrion. <div class="bookquote">``You can tell your friend,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``that he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)'s
quite wrong.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, good!''

 (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div><p/>The young man coloured a little. In his (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) circle to be
wrong was fatal. The Miss Schlegels did not mind being
wrong. They were genuinely glad that they had been
misinformed. To them nothing was fatal but evil.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Wrong, so to speak,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) added.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How `so to speak'?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I mean I wouldn't say he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)'s right altogether.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>But this was a blunder. <div class="bookquote">``Then he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) is right partly,''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>said
the elder woman, quick as lightning.

<p/>Leonard replied that every one was right partly, if it
came to that.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Bast, I don't understand business, and I dare say
my questions are stupid, but can you tell me what makes a
concern `right' or `wrong'?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Leonard/Leonard Bast/Bast</b></font>)</div><p/>Leonard sat back with a sigh.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Our friend, who is also a business man, was so
positive. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) said before Christmas--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Helen</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And advised you to clear out of it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Helen</b></font>)</div>concluded Helen.
<div class="bookquote">``But I don't see why he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) should know better than you do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Leonard/Leonard Bast/Bast</b></font>)</div><p/>Leonard rubbed his (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) hands. He (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) was tempted to say that he (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>)
knew nothing about the thing at all. But a commercial
training was too strong for him (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>). Nor could he (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) say it was a
bad thing, for this would be giving it away; nor yet that it
was good, for this would be giving it away equally. He (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>)
attempted to suggest that it was something between the two,
with vast possibilities in either direction, but broke down
under the gaze of four sincere eyes. As yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) scarcely
distinguished between the two sisters. One was more
beautiful and more lively, but <div class="bookquote">``the Miss Schlegels''  (<font color='red'><b>a god product</b></font>)</div>still
remained a composite Indian god, whose waving arms and
contradictory speeches were the product of a single mind.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``One can but see,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) remarked, adding, <div class="bookquote">``as Ibsen says,
`things happen.'''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) was itching to talk about books and
make the most of his (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) romantic hour. Minute after minute
slipped away, while the ladies, with imperfect skill,
discussed the subject of reinsurance or praised their
anonymous friend. Leonard grew annoyed--perhaps rightly.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) made vague remarks about not being one of those who
minded their affairs being talked over by others, but they
did not take the hint. Men might have shown more tact.
Women, however tactful elsewhere, are heavy-handed here.
They cannot see why we should shroud our incomes and our
prospects in a veil. <div class="bookquote">``How much exactly have you, and how
much do you expect to have next June?''  (<font color='red'><b>these women</b></font>)</div>And these were women
with a theory, who held that reticence about money matters
is absurd, and that life would be truer if each would state
the exact size of the golden island upon which he (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) stands,
the exact stretch of warp over which he (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) throws the woof that
is not money. How can we do justice to the pattern
otherwise?

<p/>And the precious minutes slipped away, and Jacky and
squalor came nearer. At last he (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) could bear it no longer,
and broke in, reciting the names of books feverishly. There
was a moment of piercing joy when Margaret said, <div class="bookquote">``So YOU
like Carlyle,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>and then the door opened, and <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Wilcox,
Miss Wilcox''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>entered, preceded by two prancing puppies.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, the dears! Oh, Evie, how too impossibly sweet!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Helen</b></font>)</div>screamed Helen, falling on her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) hands and knees.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We brought the little fellows round,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wilcox/Wilcox</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Wilcox.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I bred 'em myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, really! Mr. Bast, come and play with puppies.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I've got to be going now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Leonard/Leonard Bast/Bast</b></font>)</div>said Leonard sourly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But play with puppies a little first.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``This is Ahab, that's Jezebel,''  (<font color='red'><b>Evie/Evie Wilcox</b></font>)</div>said Evie, who was one
of those who name animals after the less successful
characters of Old Testament history.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've got to be going.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Helen</b></font>)</div><p/>Helen was too much occupied with puppies to notice him (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Wilcox, Mr. Ba--Must you be really? Good-bye!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Come again,''  (<font color='red'><b>Helen</b></font>)</div>said Helen from the floor.

<p/>Then Leonard's gorge arose. Why should he (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) come again?
What was the good of it? He (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) said roundly: <div class="bookquote">``No, I shan't; I
knew it would be a failure.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>Most people would have let him (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) go. <div class="bookquote">``A little mistake.
We tried knowing another class--impossible.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>But the
Schlegels had never played with life. They had attempted
friendship, and they would take the consequences. Helen
retorted, <div class="bookquote">``I call that a very rude remark. What do you want
to turn on me like that for?''  (<font color='red'><b>Helen</b></font>)</div>and suddenly the drawing-room
re-echoed to a vulgar row.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You ask me why I turn on you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you want to have me here for?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To help you, you silly boy!''  (<font color='red'><b>Helen</b></font>)</div>cried Helen. <div class="bookquote">``And don't shout.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't want your patronage. I don't want your tea. I
was quite happy. What do you want to unsettle me for?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>)
turned to Mr. Wilcox. <div class="bookquote">``I put it to this gentleman. I ask
you, sir, am to have my brain picked?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wilcox/Wilcox</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Wilcox turned to Margaret with the air of humorous
strength that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) could so well command. <div class="bookquote">``Are we intruding,
Miss Schlegel? Can we be of any use or shall we go?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div><p/>But Margaret ignored him (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm connected with a leading insurance company, sir. I
receive what I take to be an invitation from these--ladies''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>-LRB-he (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) drawled the word-RRB-. <div class="bookquote">``I come, and it's to have my brain
picked. I ask you, is it fair?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Highly unfair,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wilcox/Wilcox</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Wilcox, drawing a gasp from
Evie, who knew that her (<font color='blue'><b>Evie</b></font>) father was becoming dangerous.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There, you hear that? Most unfair, the gentleman
says. There! Not content with'' (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>--pointing at Margaret--<div class="bookquote">``you
can't deny it.''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) voice rose: he (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) was falling into the
rhythm of a scene with Jacky. ``But as soon as I'm useful
it's a very different thing. ``Oh yes, send for him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>).
Cross-question him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>). Pick his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) brains.<div class="bookquote">'' Oh yes. Now, take me
on the whole, I'm a quiet fellow: I'm law-abiding, I don't
wish any unpleasantness; but I--I--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>said Margaret--<div class="bookquote">``you--you--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div><p/>Laughter from Evie, as at a repartee.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are the man who tried to walk by the Pole Star.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>More laughter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You saw the sunrise.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Laughter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You tried to get away from the fogs that are stifling
us all--away past books and houses to the truth. You were
looking for a real home. ''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I fail to see the connection,''  (<font color='red'><b>Leonard/Leonard Bast/Bast</b></font>)</div>said Leonard, hot with
stupid anger.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So do I.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>There was a pause. <div class="bookquote">``You were that last
Sunday--you are this today. Mr. Bast! I and my sister have
talked you over. We wanted to help you; we also supposed
you might help us. We did not have you here out of
charity--which bores us--but because we hoped there would be
a connection between last Sunday and other days. What is
the good of your stars and trees, your sunrise and the wind,
if they do not enter into our daily lives? They have never
entered into mine, but into yours, we thought--Haven't we
all to struggle against life's daily greyness, against
pettiness, against mechanical cheerfulness, against
suspicion? I struggle by remembering my friends; others I
have known by remembering some place--some beloved place or
tree--we thought you one of these.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course, if there's been any misunderstanding,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Leonard/Leonard Bast/Bast</b></font>)</div>mumbled Leonard, <div class="bookquote">``all I can do is to go. But I beg to
state--''  (<font color='red'><b>Leonard/Leonard Bast/Bast</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) paused. Ahab and Jezebel danced at his (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) boots
and made him (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) look ridiculous. ``You were picking my brain
for official information--I can prove it--I--He (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) blew his (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>)
nose and left them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Can I help you now?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wilcox/Wilcox</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Wilcox, turning to
Margaret. <div class="bookquote">``May I have one quiet word with him (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) in the hall?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Helen, go after him (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>)--do anything--ANYTHING--to make the
noodle understand.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Helen</b></font>)</div><p/>Helen hesitated.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But really--''  (<font color='red'><b>visitor</b></font>)</div>said their visitor. <div class="bookquote">``Ought she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) to?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>At once she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) went.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) resumed. <div class="bookquote">``I would have chimed in, but I felt that
you could polish him (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) off for yourselves--I didn't
interfere. You were splendid, Miss Schlegel--absolutely
splendid. You can take my word for it, but there are very
few women who could have managed him (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>said Margaret distractedly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Bowling him (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) over with those long sentences was what
fetched me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Evie/Evie Wilcox</b></font>)</div>cried Evie.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, indeed,''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>chuckled her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) father; <div class="bookquote">``all that part about
`mechanical cheerfulness'--oh, fine!''

 (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm very sorry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>said Margaret, collecting herself.
<div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>)'s a nice creature really. I cannot think what set him (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>)
off. It has been most unpleasant for you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, _I_ didn't mind.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) changed his (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) mood. He (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>)
asked if he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) might speak as an old friend, and, permission

 (<font color='red'><b>an friend permission</b></font>)</div><p/>Margaret laughed, though her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) thoughts still strayed
after Helen. <div class="bookquote">``Do you realize that it's all your fault?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>)
said. <div class="bookquote">``You're responsible.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``This is the young man whom we were to warn against the
Porphyrion. We warn him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and--look!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wilcox/Wilcox</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Wilcox was annoyed. <div class="bookquote">``I hardly consider that a fair
deduction,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Obviously unfair,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>said Margaret. <div class="bookquote">``I was only thinking
how tangled things are. It's our fault mostly--neither
yours nor his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Schlegel, you are too kind.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, indeed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Evie/Evie Wilcox</b></font>)</div>nodded Evie, a little contemptuously.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You behave much too well to people, and then they
impose on you. I know the world and that type of man, and
as soon as I entered the room I saw you had not been
treating him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) properly. You must keep that type at a
distance. Otherwise they forget themselves. Sad, but
true. They aren't our sort, and one must face the fact.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ye-es.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do admit that we should never have had the outburst if
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was a gentleman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I admit it willingly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>said Margaret, who was pacing up
and down the room. <div class="bookquote">``A gentleman would have kept his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
suspicions to himself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wilcox/Wilcox</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Wilcox watched her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) with a vague uneasiness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What did he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) suspect you of?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of wanting to make money out of him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Intolerable brute! But how were you to benefit?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Exactly. How indeed! Just horrible, corroding
suspicion. One touch of thought or of goodwill would have
brushed it away. Just the senseless fear that does make men
intolerable brutes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I come back to my original point. You ought to be more
careful, Miss Schlegel. Your servants ought to have orders
not to let such people in.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) turned to him (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) frankly. <div class="bookquote">``Let me explain exactly why
we like this man, and want to see him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's your clever way of thinking. I shall never

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do. Firstly, because he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cares for physical
adventure, just as you do. Yes, you go motoring and
shooting; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would like to go camping out. Secondly, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
cares for something special IN adventure. It is quickest to
call that special something poetry--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s one of that writer sort.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No--oh no! I mean he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) may be, but it would be loathsome

culture--horrible; we want him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to wash out his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) brain and go
to the real thing. We want to show him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) how he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) may get

should have both.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Some of her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) words ran past Mr. Wilcox. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) let them run
past. Others he (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) caught and criticized with admirable lucidity.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your mistake is this, and it is a very common mistake.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``One minute. You know nothing about him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) probably
has his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own joys and interests--wife, children, snug little
home. That's where we practical fellows'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--he (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) smiled--<div class="bookquote">``are
more tolerant than you intellectuals. We live and let live,
and assume that things are jogging on fairly well elsewhere,
and that the ordinary plain man may be trusted to look after
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own affairs. I quite grant--I look at the faces of the
clerks in my own office, and observe them to be dull, but I
don't know what's going on beneath. So, by the way, with
London. I have heard you rail against London, Miss
Schlegel, and it seems a funny thing to say but I was very
angry with you. What do you know about London? You only
see civilization from the outside. I don't say in your
case, but in too many cases that attitude leads to
morbidity, discontent, and Socialism.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) admitted the strength of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) position, though it
undermined imagination. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) spoke, some outposts of
poetry and perhaps of sympathy fell ruining, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
retreated to what she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) called her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``second line'' (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>--to the
special facts of the case.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``His (<font color='blue'><b>Schlegel</b></font>) wife is an old bore,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) said simply. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Schlegel</b></font>) never
came home last Saturday night because he (<font color='blue'><b>Schlegel</b></font>) wanted to be alone,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Schlegel</b></font>) was with us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``With YOU?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''  (<font color='red'><b>Evie/Evie Wilcox</b></font>)</div>Evie tittered. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Schlegel</b></font>) hasn't got the cosy home that
you assumed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Schlegel</b></font>) needs outside interests.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Naughty young man!''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>cried the girl.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Naughty?''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>said Margaret, who hated naughtiness more
than sin. <div class="bookquote">``When you're married, Miss Wilcox, won't you want
outside interests?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Schlegel</b></font>) has apparently got them,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wilcox/Wilcox</b></font>)</div>put in Mr. Wilcox slyly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, indeed, Father.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) was tramping in Surrey, if you mean that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>said
Margaret, pacing away rather crossly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I dare say!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Wilcox, he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) was!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``M-m-m-m!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wilcox/Wilcox</b></font>)</div>from Mr. Wilcox, who thought the episode
amusing, if risque. With most ladies he (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) would not have
discussed it, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) was trading on Margaret's reputation as
an emanicipated woman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) said so, and about such a thing he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) wouldn't lie.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They both began to laugh.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's where I differ from you. Men lie about their
positions and prospects, but not about a thing of that sort.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``Miss Schlegel, excuse me, but I
know the type.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I said before--he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) isn't a type. He (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) cares about
adventures rightly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>)'s certain that our smug existence
isn't all. He (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>)'s vulgar and hysterical and bookish, but I
don't think that sums him (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) up. There's manhood in him (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) as
well. Yes, that's what I'm trying to say. He (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>)'s a real man.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>As she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) spoke their eyes met, and it was as if Mr.
Wilcox's defences fell. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) saw back to the real man in
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). Unwittingly she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had touched his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) emotions. A woman and
two men--they had formed the magic triangle of sex, and the
male was thrilled to jealousy, in case the female was
attracted by another male. Love, say the ascetics, reveals
our shameful kinship with the beasts. Be it so: one can
bear that; jealousy is the real shame. It is jealousy, not
love, that connects us with the farmyard intolerably, and
calls up visions of two angry cocks and a complacent hen.
Margaret crushed complacency down because she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) was
civilized. Mr. Wilcox, uncivilized, continued to feel anger
long after he (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) had rebuilt his (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) defences, and was again
presenting a bastion to the world.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Schlegel, you're a pair of dear creatures, but you
really MUST be careful in this uncharitable world. What
does your brother say?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I forget.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Surely he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) has some opinion?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) laughs, if I remember correctly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)'s very clever, isn't he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Evie/Evie Wilcox</b></font>)</div>said Evie, who had met and
detested Tibby at Oxford.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, pretty well--but I wonder what Helen's doing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) is very young to undertake this sort of thing,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wilcox/Wilcox</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Wilcox.

<p/>Margaret went out into the landing. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) heard no sound,
and Mr. Bast's topper was missing from the hall.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Helen!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) called.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>replied a voice from the library.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You in there?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes--he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)'s gone some time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div><p/>Margaret went to her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Why, you're all alone,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes--it's all right, Meg--Poor, poor creature--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Come back to the Wilcoxes and tell me later--Mr. W.
much concerned, and slightly titillated.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I've no patience with him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>). I hate him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>). Poor dear
Mr. Bast! he (<font color='blue'><b>Bast</b></font>) wanted to talk literature, and we would talk
business. Such a muddle of a man, and yet so worth pulling
through. I like him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) extraordinarily. ''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well done,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>said Margaret, kissing her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``but come into
the drawing-room now, and don't talk about him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to the
Wilcoxes. Make light of the whole thing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>Helen came and behaved with a cheerfulness that
reassured their visitor--this hen at all events was fancy-free.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s gone with my blessing,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) cried, <div class="bookquote">``and now for puppies.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>As they drove away, Mr. Wilcox said to his (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) daughter:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am really concerned at the way those girls go on.
They are as clever as you make 'em, but unpractical--God
bless me! One of these days they'll go too far. Girls like
that oughtn't to live alone in London. Until they marry,
they ought to have someone to look after them. We must look
in more often--we're better than no one. You like them,
don't you, Evie?''

 (<font color='red'><b>daughter</b></font>)</div><p/>Evie replied: <div class="bookquote">``Helen's right enough, but I can't stand
the toothy one. And I shouldn't have called either of them girls.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Evie/Evie Wilcox</b></font>)</div><p/>Evie had grown up handsome. Dark-eyed, with the glow of
youth under sunburn, built firmly and firm-lipped, she (<font color='blue'><b>Evie</b></font>) was
the best the Wilcoxes could do in the way of feminine
beauty. For the present, puppies and her (<font color='blue'><b>Evie</b></font>) father were the
only things she (<font color='blue'><b>Evie</b></font>) loved, but the net of matrimony was being
prepared for her (<font color='blue'><b>Evie</b></font>), and a few days later she (<font color='blue'><b>Evie</b></font>) was attracted to
a Mr. Percy Cahill, an uncle of Mrs. Charles, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) was
attracted to her (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>).


<p/>Chapter 17

<p/>The Age of Property holds bitter moments even for a
proprietor. When a move is imminent, furniture becomes
ridiculous, and Margaret now lay awake at nights wondering
where, where on earth they and all their belongings would be
deposited in September next. Chairs, tables, pictures,
books, that had rumbled down to them through the
generations, must rumble forward again like a slide of
rubbish to which she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) longed to give the final push, and send
toppling into the sea. But there were all their father's
books--they never read them, but they were their father's,
and must be kept. There was the marble-topped
chiffonier--their mother had set store by it, they could not
remember why. Round every knob and cushion in the house
sentiment gathered, a sentiment that was at times personal,
but more often a faint piety to the dead, a prolongation of
rites that might have ended at the grave.

<p/>It was absurd, if you came to think of it; Helen and
Tibby came to think of it: Margaret was too busy with the
house-agents. The feudal ownership of land did bring
dignity, whereas the modern ownership of movables is
reducing us again to a nomadic horde. We are reverting to
the civilization of luggage, and historians of the future
will note how the middle classes accreted possessions
without taking root in the earth, and may find in this the
secret of their imaginative poverty. The Schlegels were
certainly the poorer for the loss of Wickham Place. It had
helped to balance their lives, and almost to counsel them.
Nor is their ground-landlord spiritually the richer. He (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>) has
built flats on its site, his (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>) motor-cars grow swifter, his (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>)
exposures of Socialism more trenchant. But he (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>) has spilt the
precious distillation of the years, and no chemistry of his (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>)
can give it back to society again.

<p/>Margaret grew depressed; she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) was anxious to settle on a
house before they left town to pay their annual visit to
Mrs. Munt. She (<font color='blue'><b>Munt</b></font>) enjoyed this visit, and wanted to have her (<font color='blue'><b>Munt</b></font>)
mind at ease for it. Swanage, though dull, was stable, and
this year she (<font color='blue'><b>Munt</b></font>) longed more than usual for its fresh air and
for the magnificent downs that guard it on the north. But
London thwarted her (<font color='blue'><b>Munt</b></font>); in its atmosphere she (<font color='blue'><b>Munt</b></font>) could not
concentrate. London only stimulates, it cannot sustain; and
Margaret, hurrying over its surface for a house without
knowing what sort of a house she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) wanted, was paying for many
a thrilling sensation in the past. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) could not even break
loose from culture, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) time was wasted by concerts
which it would be a sin to miss, and invitations which it
would never do to refuse. At last she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) grew desperate; she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
resolved that she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) would go nowhere and be at home to no one
until she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) found a house, and broke the resolution in half an
hour.

<p/>Once she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) had humorously lamented that she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) had never been
to Simpson's restaurant in the Strand. Now a note arrived
from Miss Wilcox, asking her (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) to lunch there. Mr. Cahill was
coming, and the three would have such a jolly chat, and
perhaps end up at the Hippodrome. Margaret had no strong
regard for Evie, and no desire to meet her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) fiance, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
was surprised that Helen, who had been far funnier about
Simpson's, had not been asked instead. But the invitation
touched her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) by its intimate tone. She (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) must know Evie Wilcox
better than she (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) supposed, and declaring that she (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``simply
must,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) accepted.

<p/>But when she (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) saw Evie at the entrance of the restaurant,
staring fiercely at nothing after the fashion of athletic
women, her (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) heart failed her (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) anew. Miss Wilcox had changed
perceptibly since her (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) engagement. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) voice was gruffer,
her (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) manner more downright, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) was inclined to patronize
the more foolish virgin. Margaret was silly enough to be
pained at this. Depressed at her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) isolation, she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) saw not
only houses and furniture, but the vessel of life itself
slipping past her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>), with people like Evie and Mr. Cahill on board.

<p/>There are moments when virtue and wisdom fail us, and
one of them came to her (<font color='blue'><b>Evie</b></font>) at Simpson's in the Strand. As she (<font color='blue'><b>Evie</b></font>)
trod the staircase, narrow, but carpeted thickly, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Evie</b></font>)
entered the eating-room, where saddles of mutton were being
trundled up to expectant clergymen, she (<font color='blue'><b>Evie</b></font>) had a strong, if
erroneous, conviction of her (<font color='blue'><b>Evie</b></font>) own futility, and wished she (<font color='blue'><b>Evie</b></font>)
had never come out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Evie</b></font>) backwater, where nothing happened
except art and literature, and where no one ever got married
or succeeded in remaining engaged. Then came a little
surprise. <div class="bookquote">``Father might be of the party--yes, Father was.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>With a smile of pleasure she (<font color='blue'><b>Evie</b></font>) moved forward to greet him (<font color='blue'><b>Simpson</b></font>), and
her (<font color='blue'><b>Evie</b></font>) feeling of loneliness vanished.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought I'd get round if I could,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Simpson</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Evie
told me of her (<font color='blue'><b>Evie</b></font>) little plan, so I just slipped in and secured
a table. Always secure a table first. Evie, don't pretend
you want to sit by your old father, because you don't. Miss
Schlegel, come in my side, out of pity. My goodness, but
you look tired! Been worrying round after your young clerks?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, after houses,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>said Margaret, edging past him (<font color='blue'><b>Simpson</b></font>) into
the box. <div class="bookquote">``I'm hungry, not tired; I want to eat heaps.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's good. What'll you have?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Fish pie,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>), with a glance at the menu.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Fish pie! Fancy coming for fish pie to Simpson's.
It's not a bit the thing to go for here. ''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Go for something for me, then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>said Margaret, pulling
off her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) gloves. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) spirits were rising, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Simpson</b></font>) reference
to Leonard Bast had warmed her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) curiously.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Saddle of mutton,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Simpson</b></font>) after profound reflection:
<div class="bookquote">``and cider to drink. That's the type of thing. I like this
place, for a joke, once in a way. It is so thoroughly Old
English. Don't you agree?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>said Margaret, who didn't. The order was given,
the joint rolled up, and the carver, under Mr. Wilcox's
direction, cut the meat where it was succulent, and piled
their plates high. Mr. Cahill insisted on sirloin, but
admitted that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cahill</b></font>) had made a mistake later on. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cahill</b></font>) and Evie
soon fell into a conversation of the <div class="bookquote">``No, I didn't; yes, you
did''  (<font color='red'><b>Evie/Evie Wilcox</b></font>)</div>type--conversation which, though fascinating to those
who are engaged in it, neither desires nor deserves the
attention of others.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's a golden rule to tip the carver. Tip everywhere's
my motto.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps it does make life more human.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Then the fellows know one again. Especially in the
East, if you tip, they remember you from year's end to
year's end.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you been in the East?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Greece and the Levant. I used to go out for sport
and business to Cyprus; some military society of a sort
there. A few piastres, properly distributed, help to keep
one's memory green. But you, of course, think this
shockingly cynical. How's your discussion society getting
on? Any new Utopias lately?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I'm house-hunting, Mr. Wilcox, as I've already told
you once. Do you know of any houses?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Afraid I don't.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, what's the point of being practical if you can't
find two distressed females a house? We merely want a small
house with large rooms, and plenty of them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Evie, I like that! Miss Schlegel expects me to turn
house agent for her (<font color='blue'><b>Schlegel</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``What's that, Father?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I want a new home in September, and someone must find
it. I can't.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Percy, do you know of anything?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't say I do,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cahill/Cahill</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Cahill.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How like you! You're never any good.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never any good. Just listen to her (<font color='blue'><b>Schlegel</b></font>)! Never any good.
Oh, come!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, you aren't. Miss Schlegel, is he (<font color='blue'><b>Percy</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div><p/>The torrent of their love, having splashed these drops
at Margaret, swept away on its habitual course. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
sympathized with it now, for a little comfort had restored
her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) geniality. Speech and silence pleased her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) equally, and
while Mr. Wilcox made some preliminary inquiries about
cheese, her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) eyes surveyed the restaurant, and admired its
well-calculated tributes to the solidity of our past.
Though no more Old English than the works of Kipling, it had
selected its reminiscences so adroitly that her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) criticism
was lulled, and the guests whom it was nourishing for
imperial purposes bore the outer semblance of Parson Adams
or Tom Jones. Scraps of their talk jarred oddly on the
ear. <div class="bookquote">``Right you are! I'll cable out to Uganda this
evening,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>came from the table behind. <div class="bookquote">``Their Emperor wants
war; well, let him (<font color='blue'><b>Emperor</b></font>) have it,''  (<font color='red'><b>a clergyman</b></font>)</div>was the opinion of a
clergyman. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) smiled at such incongruities. <div class="bookquote">``Next time,''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) said to Mr. Wilcox, <div class="bookquote">``you shall come to lunch with me at
Mr. Eustace Miles's.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wilcox/Wilcox</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``With pleasure.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, you'd hate it,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) said, pushing her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) glass towards
him (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) for some more cider. <div class="bookquote">``It's all proteids and
body-buildings, and people come up to you and beg your
pardon, but you have such a beautiful aura.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A what?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never heard of an aura? Oh, happy, happy man! I scrub
at mine for hours. Nor of an astral plane?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) had heard of astral planes, and censured them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Just so. Luckily it was Helen's aura, not mine, and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) had to chaperone it and do the politenesses. I just sat
with my handkerchief in my mouth till the man went.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Funny experiences seem to come to you two girls. No
one's ever asked me about my--what d'ye call it? Perhaps
I've not got one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You're bound to have one, but it may be such a terrible
colour that no one dares mention it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell me, though, Miss Schlegel, do you really believe
in the supernatural and all that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Too difficult a question.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why's that? Gruyere or Stilton?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Gruyere, please.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Better have Stilton.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Stilton. Because, though I don't believe in auras, and
think Theosophy's only a halfway-house--''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">''--Yet there may be something in it all the same,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>)
concluded, with a frown.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not even that. It may be halfway in the wrong
direction. I can't explain. I don't believe in all these
fads, and yet I don't like saying that I don't believe in them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) seemed unsatisfied, and said: ``So you wouldn't give
me your word that you DON<div class="bookquote">``T hold with astral bodies and all
the rest of it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I could,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>said Margaret, surprised that the point was
of any importance to him (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Indeed, I will. When I talked
about scrubbing my aura, I was only trying to be funny. But
why do you want this settled?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, Mr. Wilcox, you do know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I am,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lovers</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No, you're not,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lovers</b></font>)</div>burst from the lovers
opposite. Margaret was silent for a moment, and then
changed the subject.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How's your house?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Much the same as when you honoured it last week.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't mean Ducie Street. Howards End, of course.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why `of course'?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Can't you turn out your tenant and let it to us? We're
nearly demented.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Let me think. I wish I could help you. But I thought
you wanted to be in town. One bit of advice: fix your
district, then fix your price, and then don't budge. That's
how I got both Ducie Street and Oniton. I said to myself,
``I mean to be exactly here,<div class="bookquote">'' and I was, and Oniton's a place
in a thousand.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I do budge. Gentlemen seem to mesmerize
houses--cow them with an eye, and up they come, trembling.
Ladies can't. It's the houses that are mesmerizing me.
I've no control over the saucy things. Houses are alive. No?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm out of my depth,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) said, and added: <div class="bookquote">``Didn't you
talk rather like that to your office boy?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did I? --I mean I did, more or less. I talk the same
way to every one--or try to.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I know. And how much do you suppose that he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
understood of it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) lookout. I don't believe in suiting my
conversation to my company. One can doubtless hit upon some
medium of exchange that seems to do well enough, but it's no
more like the real thing than money is like food. There's
no nourishment in it. You pass it to the lower classes, and
they pass it back to you, and this you call `social
intercourse' or `mutual endeavour,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>when it's mutual
priggishness if it's anything. Our friends at Chelsea don't
see this. They say one ought to be at all costs
intelligible, and sacrifice--''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Lower classes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wilcox/Wilcox</b></font>)</div>interrupted Mr. Wilcox, as it were
thrusting his (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) hand into her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) speech. <div class="bookquote">``Well, you do admit
that there are rich and poor. That's something.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div><p/>Margaret could not reply. Was he (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) incredibly stupid, or
did he (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) understand her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) better than she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) understood herself?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You do admit that, if wealth was divided up equally, in
a few years there would be rich and poor again just the
same. The hard-working man would come to the top, the
wastrel sink to the bottom.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Every one admits that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Your Socialists don't.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My Socialists do. Yours mayn't; but I strongly suspect
yours of being not Socialists, but ninepins, which you have
constructed for your own amusement. I can't imagine any
living creature who would bowl over quite so easily.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) would have resented this had she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) not been a woman.
But women may say anything--it was one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) holiest
beliefs--and he (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) only retorted, with a gay smile: <div class="bookquote">``I don't
care. You've made two damaging admissions, and I'm heartily
with you in both.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>In time they finished lunch, and Margaret, who had
excused herself from the Hippodrome, took her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) leave. Evie
had scarcely addressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Evie</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Evie</b></font>) suspected that the
entertainment had been planned by the father. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) and she (<font color='blue'><b>Evie</b></font>)
were advancing out of their respective families towards a
more intimate acquaintance. It had begun long ago. She (<font color='blue'><b>Evie</b></font>) had
been his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) wife's friend, and, as such, he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) had given her (<font color='blue'><b>Evie</b></font>) that
silver vinaigrette as a memento. It was pretty of him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) to
have given that vinaigrette, and he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) had always preferred her (<font color='blue'><b>Evie</b></font>)
to Helen--unlike most men. But the advance had been
astonishing lately. They had done more in a week than in
two years, and were really beginning to know each other.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Evie</b></font>) did not forget his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) promise to sample Eustace Miles,
and asked him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Evie</b></font>) could secure Tibby as his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>)
chaperon. He (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) came, and partook of body-building dishes with
humility.

<p/>Next morning the Schlegels left for Swanage. They had
not succeeded in finding a new home.


<p/>Chapter 18

<p/>As they were seated at Aunt Juley's breakfast-table at The
Bays, parrying her (<font color='blue'><b>Juley</b></font>) excessive hospitality and enjoying the
view of the bay, a letter came for Margaret and threw her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
into perturbation. It was from Mr. Wilcox. It announced an
<div class="bookquote">``important change''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>in his (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) plans. Owing to Evie's marriage,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) had decided to give up his (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) house in Ducie Street, and was
willing to let it on a yearly tenancy. It was a
businesslike letter, and stated frankly what he (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) would do for
them and what he (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) would not do. Also the rent. If they
approved, Margaret was to come up AT ONCE--the words were
underlined, as is necessary when dealing with women--and to
go over the house with him (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>). If they disapproved, a wire
would oblige, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) should put it into the hands of an agent.

<p/>The letter perturbed, because she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) was not sure what it
meant. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) liked her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>), if he (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) had manoeuvred to get her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) to
Simpson's, might this be a manoeuvre to get her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) to London,
and result in an offer of marriage? She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) put it to herself
as indelicately as possible, in the hope that her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) brain
would cry, <div class="bookquote">``Rubbish, you're a self-conscious fool!''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>But her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
brain only tingled a little and was silent, and for a time
she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) sat gazing at the mincing waves, and wondering whether
the news would seem strange to the others.

<p/>As soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) began speaking, the sound of her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) own
voice reassured her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>). There could be nothing in it. The
replies also were typical, and in the buff of conversation
her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) fears vanished.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You needn't go though--''  (<font color='red'><b>hostess</b></font>)</div>began her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) hostess.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I needn't, but hadn't I better? It's really getting
rather serious. We let chance after chance slip, and the
end of it is we shall be bundled out bag and baggage into
the street. We don't know what we WANT, that's the mischief
with us--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Helen</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, we have no real ties,''  (<font color='red'><b>Helen</b></font>)</div>said Helen, helping herself
to toast.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Shan't I go up to town today, take the house if it's
the least possible, and then come down by the afternoon
train tomorrow, and start enjoying myself. I shall be no
fun to myself or to others until this business is off my mind.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you won't do anything rash, Margaret?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There's nothing rash to do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who ARE the Wilcoxes?''  (<font color='red'><b>Tibby</b></font>)</div>said Tibby, a question that
sounds silly, but was really extremely subtle, as his (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) aunt
found to her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) cost when she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) tried to answer it. <div class="bookquote">``I don't
MANAGE the Wilcoxes; I don't see where they come IN.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No more do I,''  (<font color='red'><b>Helen</b></font>)</div>agreed Helen. ``It's funny that we just
don't lose sight of them. Out of all our hotel
acquaintances, Mr. Wilcox is the only one who has stuck. It
is now over three years, and we have drifted away from far
more interesting people in that time.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Interesting people don't get one houses.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Meg, if you start in your honest-English vein, I shall
throw the treacle at you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's a better vein than the cosmopolitan,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>said
Margaret, getting up. <div class="bookquote">``Now, children, which is it to be?
You know the Ducie Street house. Shall I say yes or shall I
say no? Tibby love--which? I'm specially anxious to pin
you both.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It all depends what meaning you attach to the word `possi--'''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It depends on nothing of the sort. Say `yes.'''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Say `no.'''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div><p/>Then Margaret spoke rather seriously. <div class="bookquote">``I think,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
said, <div class="bookquote">``that our race is degenerating. We cannot settle even
this little thing; what will it be like when we have to
settle a big one?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It will be as easy as eating,''  (<font color='red'><b>Helen</b></font>)</div>returned Helen.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I was thinking of Father. How could he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) settle to leave
Germany as he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) did, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) had fought for it as a young man,
and all his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) feelings and friends were Prussian? How could
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) break loose with Patriotism and begin aiming at something
else? It would have killed me. When he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was nearly forty he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
could change countries and ideals--and we, at our age, can't
change houses. It's humiliating.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Your father may have been able to change countries,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Munt</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Munt with asperity, <div class="bookquote">``and that may or may not be a
good thing. But he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) could change houses no better than you
can, in fact, much worse. Never shall I forget what poor
Emily suffered in the move from Manchester.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Munt</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I knew it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Helen</b></font>)</div>cried Helen. <div class="bookquote">``I told you so. It is the
little things one bungles at. The big, real ones are
nothing when they come.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Bungle, my dear! You are too little to recollect--in
fact, you weren't there. But the furniture was actually in
the vans and on the move before the lease for Wickham Place
was signed, and Emily took train with baby--who was Margaret
then--and the smaller luggage for London, without so much as
knowing where her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) new home would be. Getting away from that
house may be hard, but it is nothing to the misery that we
all went through getting you into it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Helen</b></font>)</div><p/>Helen, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) mouth full, cried: <div class="bookquote">``And that's the man
who beat the Austrians, and the Danes, and the French, and
who beat the Germans that were inside himself. And we're
like him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Helen</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Speak for yourself,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tibby</b></font>)</div>said Tibby. <div class="bookquote">``Remember that I am
cosmopolitan, please.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Helen may be right.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>)'s right,''  (<font color='red'><b>Helen</b></font>)</div>said Helen.

<p/>Helen might be right, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) did not go up to London.
Margaret did that. An interrupted holiday is the worst of
the minor worries, and one may be pardoned for feeling
morbid when a business letter snatches one away from the sea
and friends. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) could not believe that her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) father had ever
felt the same. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) eyes had been troubling her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) lately, so
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) could not read in the train, and it bored her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) to
look at the landscape, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) had seen but yesterday. At
Southampton she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``waved''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>to Frieda: Frieda was on her (<font color='blue'><b>Frieda</b></font>) way
down to join them at Swanage, and Mrs. Munt had calculated
that their trains would cross. But Frieda was looking the
other way, and Margaret travelled on to town feeling
solitary and old-maidish. How like an old maid to fancy
that Mr. Wilcox was courting her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)! She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) had once visited a
spinster--poor, silly, and unattractive--whose mania it was
that every man who approached her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) fell in love. How
Margaret's heart had bled for the deluded thing! How she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
had lectured, reasoned, and in despair acquiesced! <div class="bookquote">``I may
have been deceived by the curate, my dear, but the young
fellow who brings the midday post really is fond of me, and
has, as a matter fact--''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>It had always seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) the
most hideous corner of old age, yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) might be driven into
it herself by the mere pressure of virginity.

<p/>Mr. Wilcox met her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) at Waterloo himself. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) felt
certain that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) was not the same as usual; for one thing, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>)
took offence at everything she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This is awfully kind of you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) began, <div class="bookquote">``but I'm
afraid it's not going to do. The house has not been built
that suits the Schlegel family.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What! Have you come up determined not to deal?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not exactly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not exactly? In that case let's be starting.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) lingered to admire the motor, which was new and a
fairer creature than the vermilion giant that had borne Aunt
Juley to her (<font color='blue'><b>Juley</b></font>) doom three years before.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Presumably it's very beautiful,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Juley</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``How do you
like it, Crane?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, let's be starting,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>repeated her (<font color='blue'><b>Juley</b></font>) host. <div class="bookquote">``How on
earth did you know that my chauffeur was called Crane?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, I know Crane: I've been for a drive with Evie
once. I know that you've got a parlourmaid called Milton.
I know all sorts of things.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Evie!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) echoed in injured tones. <div class="bookquote">``You won't see
her (<font color='blue'><b>Evie</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Evie</b></font>)'s gone out with Cahill. It's no fun, I can tell
you, being left so much alone. I've got my work all
day--indeed, a great deal too much of it--but when I come
home in the evening, I tell you, I can't stand the house.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In my absurd way, I'm lonely too,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>Margaret replied.
<div class="bookquote">``It's heart-breaking to leave one's old home. I scarcely
remember anything before Wickham Place, and Helen and Tibby
were born there. Helen says--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You, too, feel lonely?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Horribly. Hullo, Parliament's back!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wilcox/Wilcox</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Wilcox glanced at Parliament contemptuously. The
more important ropes of life lay elsewhere. <div class="bookquote">``Yes, they are
talking again.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``But you were going to say--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Only some rubbish about furniture. Helen says it alone
endures while men and houses perish, and that in the end the
world will be a desert of chairs and sofas--just imagine
it! --rolling through infinity with no one to sit upon them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Your sister always likes her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) little joke.

<p/>``She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) says ``Yes,'' my brother says ``No,<div class="bookquote">'' to Ducie Street.
It's no fun helping us, Mr. Wilcox, I assure you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are not as unpractical as you pretend. I shall
never believe it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div><p/>Margaret laughed. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) was--quite as unpractical.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) could not concentrate on details. Parliament, the
Thames, the irresponsive chauffeur, would flash into the
field of house-hunting, and all demand some comment or
response. It is impossible to see modern life steadily and
see it whole, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) had chosen to see it whole. Mr.
Wilcox saw steadily. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) never bothered over the mysterious
or the private. The Thames might run inland from the sea,
the chauffeur might conceal all passion and philosophy
beneath his (<font color='blue'><b>chauffeur</b></font>) unhealthy skin. They knew their own business,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>chauffeur</b></font>) knew his (<font color='blue'><b>chauffeur</b></font>).

<p/>Yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) liked being with him (<font color='blue'><b>chauffeur</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>chauffeur</b></font>) was not a rebuke, but
a stimulus, and banished morbidity. Some twenty years her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
senior, he (<font color='blue'><b>chauffeur</b></font>) preserved a gift that she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) supposed herself to
have already lost--not youth's creative power, but its
self-confidence and optimism. He (<font color='blue'><b>chauffeur</b></font>) was so sure that it was a
very pleasant world. His (<font color='blue'><b>chauffeur</b></font>) complexion was robust, his (<font color='blue'><b>chauffeur</b></font>) hair
had receded but not thinned, the thick moustache and the
eyes that Helen had compared to brandy-balls had an
agreeable menace in them, whether they were turned towards
the slums or towards the stars. Some day--in the
millennium--there may be no need for his (<font color='blue'><b>chauffeur</b></font>) type. At present,
homage is due to it from those who think themselves
superior, and who possibly are.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``At all events you responded to my telegram promptly,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>chauffeur</b></font>) remarked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, even I know a good thing when I see it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm glad you don't despise the goods of this world.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Heavens, no! Only idiots and prigs do that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am glad, very glad,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>chauffeur</b></font>) repeated, suddenly softening
and turning to her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>), as if the remark had pleased him (<font color='blue'><b>chauffeur</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``There is so much cant talked in would-be intellectual
circles. I am glad you don't share it. Self-denial is all
very well as a means of strengthening the character. But I
can't stand those people who run down comforts. They have
usually some axe to grind. Can you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Comforts are of two kinds,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>said Margaret, who was
keeping herself in hand--<div class="bookquote">``those we can share with others,
like fire, weather, or music; and those we can't--food, for
instance. It depends.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I mean reasonable comforts, of course. I shouldn't
like to think that you--''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>chauffeur</b></font>) bent nearer; the sentence died
unfinished. Margaret's head turned very stupid, and the
inside of it seemed to revolve like the beacon in a
lighthouse. He (<font color='blue'><b>chauffeur</b></font>) did not kiss her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>), for the hour was half-past
twelve, and the car was passing by the stables of Buckingham
Palace. But the atmosphere was so charged with emotion that
people only seemed to exist on her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) account, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) was
surprised that Crane did not realize this, and turn round.
Idiot though she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) might be, surely Mr. Wilcox was more--how
should one put it? --more psychological than usual. Always
a good judge of character for business purposes, he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) seemed
this afternoon to enlarge his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) field, and to note qualities
outside neatness, obedience, and decision.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I want to go over the whole house,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) announced when
they arrived. <div class="bookquote">``As soon as I get back to Swanage, which will
be tomorrow afternoon, I'll talk it over once more with
Helen and Tibby, and wire you `yes' or `no.'''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Right. The dining-room.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>And they began their survey.

<p/>The dining-room was big, but over-furnished. Chelsea
would have moaned aloud. Mr. Wilcox had eschewed those
decorative schemes that wince, and relent, and refrain, and
achieve beauty by sacrificing comfort and pluck. After so
much self-colour and self-denial, Margaret viewed with
relief the sumptuous dado, the frieze, the gilded
wall-paper, amid whose foliage parrots sang. It would never
do with her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) own furniture, but those heavy chairs, that
immense side-board loaded with presentation plate, stood up
against its pressure like men. The room suggested men, and
Margaret, keen to derive the modern capitalist from the
warriors and hunters of the past, saw it as an ancient
guest-hall, where the lord sat at meat among his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) thanes.
Even the Bible--the Dutch Bible that Charles had brought
back from the Boer War--fell into position. Such a room
admitted loot.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now the entrance-hall.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The entrance-hall was paved.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here we fellows smoke.''

 (<font color='red'><b>fellows</b></font>)</div><p/>We fellows smoked in chairs of maroon leather. It was
as if a motor-car had spawned. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, jolly!''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>said Margaret,
sinking into one of them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You do like it?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>maroon</b></font>) said, fixing his (<font color='blue'><b>maroon</b></font>) eyes on her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
upturned face, and surely betraying an almost intimate
note. <div class="bookquote">``It's all rubbish not making oneself comfortable.
Isn't it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ye-es. Semi-rubbish. Are those Cruikshanks?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Gillrays. Shall we go on upstairs?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Does all this furniture come from Howards End?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The Howards End furniture has all gone to Oniton.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Does--However, I'm concerned with the house, not the
furniture. How big is this smoking-room?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thirty by fifteen. No, wait a minute. Fifteen and a half?.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, well. Mr. Wilcox, aren't you ever amused at the
solemnity with which we middle classes approach the subject
of houses?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They proceeded to the drawing-room. Chelsea managed
better here. It was sallow and ineffective. One could
visualize the ladies withdrawing to it, while their lords
discussed life's realities below, to the accompaniment of
cigars. Had Mrs. Wilcox's drawing-room looked thus at
Howards End? Just as this thought entered Margaret's brain,
Mr. Wilcox did ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) to be his (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) wife, and the knowledge
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) had been right so overcame her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) nearly fainted.

<p/>But the proposal was not to rank among the world's great
love scenes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Schlegel'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--his (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) voice was firm--<div class="bookquote">``I have had you up
on false pretences. I want to speak about a much more
serious matter than a house.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div><p/>Margaret almost answered: <div class="bookquote">``I know--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Could you be induced to share my--is it probable--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Mr. Wilcox!''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) interrupted, holding the piano and
averting her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) eyes. <div class="bookquote">``I see, I see. I will write to you
afterwards if I may.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) began to stammer. <div class="bookquote">``Miss Schlegel--Margaret--you
don't understand.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh yes! Indeed, yes!''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>said Margaret.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am asking you to be my wife.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>So deep already was her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) sympathy, that when he (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I
am asking you to be my wife,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) made herself give a little
start. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) must show surprise if he (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) expected it. An
immense joy came over her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>). It was indescribable. It had
nothing to do with humanity, and most resembled the
all-pervading happiness of fine weather. Fine weather is
due to the sun, but Margaret could think of no central
radiance here. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) stood in his (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) drawing-room happy, and
longing to give happiness. On leaving him (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) realized that
the central radiance had been love.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You aren't offended, Miss Schlegel?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How could I be offended?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>There was a moment's pause. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) was anxious to get rid
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) knew it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) had too much intuition to look
at him (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) struggled for possessions that money cannot
buy. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) desired comradeship and affection, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) feared
them, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>), who had taught herself only to desire, and
could have clothed the struggle with beauty, held back, and
hesitated with him (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good-bye,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) continued. ``You will have a letter from
me--I am going back to Swanage tomorrow.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good-bye, and it's you I thank.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I may order the motor round, mayn't I?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That would be most kind.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish I had written instead. Ought I to have written?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not at all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There's just one question--''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) head. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) looked a little bewildered, and
they parted.

<p/>They parted without shaking hands: she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) had kept the
interview, for his (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) sake, in tints of the quietest grey. Yet
she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) thrilled with happiness ere she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) reached her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) own house.
Others had loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) in the past, if one may apply to their
brief desires so grave a word, but those others had been
<div class="bookquote">``ninnies'' (<font color='red'><b>those others</b></font>)</div>--young men who had nothing to do, old men who
could find nobody better. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) had often <div class="bookquote">``loved,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>too,
but only so far as the facts of sex demanded: mere yearnings
for the masculine, to be dismissed for what they were worth,
with a smile. Never before had her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) personality been
touched. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) was not young or very rich, and it amazed her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
that a man of any standing should take her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) seriously. As
she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) sat trying to do accounts in her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) empty house, amidst
beautiful pictures and noble books, waves of emotion broke,
as if a tide of passion was flowing through the night air.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) head, tried to concentrate her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) attention, and
failed. In vain did she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) repeat: <div class="bookquote">``But I've been through this
sort of thing before.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) had never been through it; the
big machinery, as opposed to the little, had been set in
motion, and the idea that Mr. Wilcox loved, obsessed her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
before she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) came to love him (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) in return.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) would come to no decision yet. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, sir, this is so
sudden'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--that prudish phrase exactly expressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) when her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
time came. Premonitions are not preparation. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) must
examine more closely her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) own nature and his (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) must talk
it over judicially with Helen. It had been a strange
love-scene--the central radiance unacknowledged from first
to last. She (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>), in his (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) place, would have said <div class="bookquote">``Ich liebe
dich,''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>but perhaps it was not his (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) habit to open the heart.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) might have done it if she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) had pressed him (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>)--as a matter of
duty, perhaps; England expects every man to open his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) heart
once; but the effort would have jarred him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and never, if
she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) could avoid it, should he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lose those defences that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
had chosen to raise against the world. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) must never be
bothered with emotional talk, or with a display of
sympathy. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was an elderly man now, and it would be futile
and impudent to correct him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).

<p/>Mrs. Wilcox strayed in and out, ever a welcome ghost;
surveying the scene, thought Margaret, without one hint of
bitterness.


<p/>Chapter 19

<p/>If one wanted to show a foreigner England, perhaps the
wisest course would be to take him (<font color='blue'><b>foreigner</b></font>) to the final section of
the Purbeck Hills, and stand him (<font color='blue'><b>foreigner</b></font>) on their summit, a few
miles to the east of Corfe. Then system after system of our
island would roll together under his (<font color='blue'><b>foreigner</b></font>) feet. Beneath him (<font color='blue'><b>foreigner</b></font>) is
the valley of the Frome, and all the wild lands that come
tossing down from Dorchester, black and gold, to mirror
their gorse in the expanses of Poole. The valley of the
Stour is beyond, unaccountable stream, dirty at Blandford,
pure at Wimborne--the Stour, sliding out of fat fields, to
marry the Avon beneath the tower of Christchurch. The
valley of the Avon--invisible, but far to the north the
trained eye may see Clearbury Ring that guards it, and the
imagination may leap beyond that on to Salisbury Plain
itself, and beyond the Plain to all the glorious downs of
Central England. Nor is Suburbia absent. Bournemouth's
ignoble coast cowers to the right, heralding the pine-trees
that mean, for all their beauty, red houses, and the Stock
Exchange, and extend to the gates of London itself. So
tremendous is the City's trail! But the cliffs of
Freshwater it shall never touch, and the island will guard
the Island's purity till the end of time. Seen from the
west, the Wight is beautiful beyond all laws of beauty. It
is as if a fragment of England floated forward to greet the
foreigner--chalk of our chalk, turf of our turf, epitome of
what will follow. And behind the fragment lies Southampton,
hostess to the nations, and Portsmouth, a latent fire, and
all around it, with double and treble collision of tides,
swirls the sea. How many villages appear in this view! How
many castles! How many churches, vanished or triumphant!
How many ships, railways, and roads! What incredible
variety of men working beneath that lucent sky to what final
end! The reason fails, like a wave on the Swanage beach;
the imagination swells, spreads, and deepens, until it
becomes geographic and encircles England.

<p/>So Frieda Mosebach, now Frau Architect Liesecke, and
mother to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) husband's baby, was brought up to these
heights to be impressed, and, after a prolonged gaze, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
said that the hills were more swelling here than in
Pomerania, which was true, but did not seem to Mrs. Munt
apposite. Poole Harbour was dry, which led her (<font color='blue'><b>Munt</b></font>) to praise
the absence of muddy foreshore at Friedrich Wilhelms Bad,
Rugen, where beech-trees hang over the tideless Baltic, and
cows may contemplate the brine. Rather unhealthy Mrs. Munt
thought this would be, water being safer when it moved about.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And your English lakes--Vindermere, Grasmere--are they,
then, unhealthy?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, Frau Liesecke; but that is because they are fresh
water, and different. Salt water ought to have tides, and
go up and down a great deal, or else it smells. Look, for
instance, at an aquarium.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``An aquarium! Oh, MEESIS Munt, you mean to tell me that
fresh aquariums stink less than salt? Why, when Victor, my
brother-in-law, collected many tadpoles--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Helen</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are not to say `stink,'''  (<font color='red'><b>Helen</b></font>)</div>interrupted Helen; <div class="bookquote">``at
least, you may say it, but you must pretend you are being
funny while you say it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Helen</b></font>)</div><p/>``Then ``smell.<div class="bookquote">'' And the mud of your Pool down there--does
it not smell, or may I say `stink, ha, ha'?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There always has been mud in Poole Harbour,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Munt</b></font>)</div>said Mrs.
Munt, with a slight frown. <div class="bookquote">``The rivers bring it down, and a
most valuable oyster-fishery depends upon it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, that is so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Frieda/Frieda Mosebach</b></font>)</div>conceded Frieda; and another
international incident was closed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">''`Bournemouth is,'''  (<font color='red'><b>Frieda/Frieda Mosebach</b></font>)</div>resumed their hostess, quoting a
local rhyme to which she (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>) was much attached--'' ``Bournemouth
is, Poole was, and Swanage is to be the most important town
of all and biggest of the three.<div class="bookquote">'' Now, Frau Liesecke, I have
shown you Bournemouth, and I have shown you Poole, so let us
walk backward a little, and look down again at Swanage.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Poole</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Aunt Juley, wouldn't that be Meg's train?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>A tiny puff of smoke had been circling the harbour, and
now was bearing southwards towards them over the black and
the gold.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, dearest Margaret, I do hope she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) won't be overtired.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I do wonder--I do wonder whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)'s taken the house.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) hasn't been hasty.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So do I--oh, so do I.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Frieda/Frieda Mosebach</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Will it be as beautiful as Wickham Place?''  (<font color='red'><b>Frieda/Frieda Mosebach</b></font>)</div>Frieda asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I should think it would. Trust Mr. Wilcox for doing
himself proud. All those Ducie Street houses are beautiful
in their modern way, and I can't think why he (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) doesn't keep
on with it. But it's really for Evie that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) went there,
and now that Evie's going to be married--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You've never seen Miss Wilcox, Frieda. How absurdly
matrimonial you are!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But sister to that Paul?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And to that Charles,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Munt</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Munt with feeling.
<div class="bookquote">``Oh, Helen, Helen, what a time that was!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Helen</b></font>)</div><p/>Helen laughed. <div class="bookquote">``Meg and I haven't got such tender
hearts. If there's a chance of a cheap house, we go for it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now look, Frau Liesecke, at my niece's train. You see,
it is coming towards us--coming, coming; and, when it gets
to Corfe, it will actually go THROUGH the downs, on which we
are standing, so that, if we walk over, as I suggested, and
look down on Swanage, we shall see it coming on the other
side. Shall we?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Frieda/Frieda Mosebach</b></font>)</div><p/>Frieda assented, and in a few minutes they had crossed
the ridge and exchanged the greater view for the lesser.
Rather a dull valley lay below, backed by the slope of the
coastward downs. They were looking across the Isle of
Purbeck and on to Swanage, soon to be the most important
town of all, and ugliest of the three. Margaret's train
reappeared as promised, and was greeted with approval by her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
aunt. It came to a standstill in the middle distance, and
there it had been planned that Tibby should meet her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>), and
drive her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>), and a tea-basket, up to join them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You see,''  (<font color='red'><b>Helen</b></font>)</div>continued Helen to her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) cousin, <div class="bookquote">``the Wilcoxes
collect houses as your Victor collects tadpoles. They have,
one, Ducie Street; two, Howards End, where my great rumpus
was; three, a country seat in Shropshire; four, Charles has
a house in Hilton; and five, another near Epsom; and six,
Evie will have a house when she (<font color='blue'><b>Evie</b></font>) marries, and probably a
pied-a-terre in the country--which makes seven. Oh yes, and
Paul a hut in Africa makes eight. I wish we could get
Howards End. That was something like a dear little house!
Didn't you think so, Aunt Juley?''

 (<font color='red'><b>cousin</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">'' I had too much to do, dear, to look at it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Munt</b></font>)</div>said Mrs.
Munt, with a gracious dignity. <div class="bookquote">``I had everything to settle
and explain, and Charles Wilcox to keep in his (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) place
besides. It isn't likely I should remember much. I just
remember having lunch in your bedroom.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes so do I. But, oh dear, dear, how dead it all
seems! And in the autumn there began this anti-Pauline
movement--you, and Frieda, and Meg, and Mrs. Wilcox, all
obsessed with the idea that I might yet marry Paul.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You yet may,''  (<font color='red'><b>Frieda/Frieda Mosebach</b></font>)</div>said Frieda despondently.

<p/>Helen shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``The Great Wilcox Peril will
never return. If I'm certain of anything it's of that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``One is certain of nothing but the truth of one's own emotions.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The remark fell damply on the conversation. But Helen
slipped her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) arm round her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) cousin, somehow liking her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) the
better for making it. It was not an original remark, nor
had Frieda appropriated it passionately, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Frieda</b></font>) had a
patriotic rather than a philosophic mind. Yet it betrayed
that interest in the universal which the average Teuton
possesses and the average Englishman does not. It was,
however illogically, the good, the beautiful, the true, as
opposed to the respectable, the pretty, the adequate. It
was a landscape of Bocklin's beside a landscape of Leader's,
strident and ill-considered, but quivering into supernatural
life. It sharpened idealism, stirred the soul. It may have
been a bad preparation for what followed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Look!''  (<font color='red'><b>Aunt</b></font>)</div>cried Aunt Juley, hurrying away from
generalities over the narrow summit of the down. <div class="bookquote">``Stand
where I stand, and you will see the pony-cart coming. I see
the pony-cart coming.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They stood and saw the pony-cart coming. Margaret and
Tibby were presently seen coming in it. Leaving the
outskirts of Swanage, it drove for a little through the
budding lanes, and then began the ascent.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you got the house?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>they shouted, long before she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
could possibly hear.

<p/>Helen ran down to meet her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>). The highroad passed over a
saddle, and a track went thence at right angles along the
ridge of the down.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you got the house?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div><p/>Margaret shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) head.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, what a nuisance! So we're as we were?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not exactly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) got out, looking tired.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Some mystery,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tibby</b></font>)</div>said Tibby. <div class="bookquote">``We are to be enlightened presently.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div><p/>Margaret came close up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) and whispered that she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) had
had a proposal of marriage from Mr. Wilcox.

<p/>Helen was amused. She (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) opened the gate on to the downs
so that her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) brother might lead the pony through. <div class="bookquote">``It's just
like a widower,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) remarked. <div class="bookquote">``They've cheek enough for
anything, and invariably select one of their first wife's friends.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div><p/>Margaret's face flashed despair.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That type--''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) broke off with a cry. <div class="bookquote">``Meg, not
anything wrong with you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Wait one minute,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>said Margaret, whispering always.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But you've never conceivably--you've never--''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
pulled herself together. <div class="bookquote">``Tibby, hurry up through; I can't
hold this gate indefinitely. Aunt Juley! I say, Aunt
Juley, make the tea, will you, and Frieda; we've got to talk
houses, and I'll come on afterwards.''  (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div>And then, turning her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
face to her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) sister's, she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) burst into tears.

<p/>Margaret was stupefied. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) heard herself saying, <div class="bookquote">``Oh,
really--''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) felt herself touched with a hand that trembled.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't,''  (<font color='red'><b>Helen</b></font>)</div>sobbed Helen, <div class="bookquote">``don't, don't, Meg, don't!''  (<font color='red'><b>Helen</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>)
seemed incapable of saying any other word. Margaret,
trembling herself, led her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) forward up the road, till they
strayed through another gate on to the down.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't, don't do such a thing! I tell you not
to--don't! I know--don't!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you know?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Panic and emptiness,''  (<font color='red'><b>Helen</b></font>)</div>sobbed Helen. <div class="bookquote">``Don't!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div><p/>Then Margaret thought, ``Helen is a little selfish. I
have never behaved like this when there has seemed a chance
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) marrying. She (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) said: <div class="bookquote">``But we would still see each
other very often, and--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Helen</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's not a thing like that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Helen</b></font>)</div>sobbed Helen. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
broke right away and wandered distractedly upwards,
stretching her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) hands towards the view and crying.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What's happened to you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>called Margaret, following
through the wind that gathers at sundown on the northern
slopes of hills. <div class="bookquote">``But it's stupid!''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>And suddenly stupidity
seized her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>), and the immense landscape was blurred. But
Helen turned back.

<p/><div class="bookquote">'' Meg--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Helen</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know what's happened to either of us,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>said
Margaret, wiping her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) eyes. <div class="bookquote">``We must both have gone mad.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Helen</b></font>)</div>Then Helen wiped hers, and they even laughed a little.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Look here, sit down.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``All right; I'll sit down if you'll sit down.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There. -LRB-One kiss.-RRB- Now, whatever, whatever is the matter?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do mean what I said. Don't; it wouldn't do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Oh, Helen, stop saying `don't'! It's ignorant. It's
as if your head wasn't out of the slime. <div class="bookquote">``Don't' is
probably what Mrs. Bast says all the day to Mr. Bast.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Helen</b></font>)</div><p/>Helen was silent.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell me about it first, and meanwhile perhaps I'll have
got my head out of the slime.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``That's better. Well, where shall I begin? When I
arrived at Waterloo--no, I'll go back before that, because
I'm anxious you should know everything from the first. The
`first' was about ten days ago. It was the day Mr. Bast
came to tea and lost his (<font color='blue'><b>Bast</b></font>) temper. I was defending him (<font color='blue'><b>Bast</b></font>), and
Mr. Wilcox became jealous about me, however slightly. I
thought it was the involuntary thing, which men can't help
any more than we can. You know--at least, I know in my own
case--when a man has said to me, ``So-and-so's a pretty
girl,<div class="bookquote">'' I am seized with a momentary sourness against
So-and-so, and long to tweak her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) ear. It's a tiresome
feeling, but not an important one, and one easily manages
it. But it wasn't only this in Mr. Wilcox's case, I gather now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>So-and-so a girl</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then you love him (<font color='blue'><b>So-and-so</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div><p/>Margaret considered. <div class="bookquote">``It is wonderful knowing that a
real man cares for you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) said. ``The mere fact of that
grows more tremendous. Remember, I've known and liked him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
steadily for nearly three years.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But loved him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div><p/>Margaret peered into her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) past. It is pleasant to
analyze feelings while they are still only feelings, and
unembodied in the social fabric. With her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) arm round Helen,
and her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) eyes shifting over the view, as if this county or
that could reveal the secret of her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) own heart, she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) meditated
honestly, and said, <div class="bookquote">``No.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you will?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>said Margaret, <div class="bookquote">``of that I'm pretty sure. Indeed,
I began the moment he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) spoke to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And have settled to marry him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I had, but am wanting a long talk about it now. What
is it against him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), Helen? You must try and say.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Helen</b></font>)</div><p/>Helen, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) turn, looked outwards. <div class="bookquote">``It is ever since
Paul,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) said finally.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But what has Mr. Wilcox to do with Paul?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was there, they were all there that morning when
I came down to breakfast, and saw that Paul was
frightened--the man who loved me frightened and all his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
paraphernalia fallen, so that I knew it was impossible,
because personal relations are the important thing for ever
and ever, and not this outer life of telegrams and anger.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) poured the sentence forth in one breath, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>)
sister understood it, because it touched on thoughts that
were familiar between them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's foolish. In the first place, I disagree about
the outer life. Well, we've often argued that. The real
point is that there is the widest gulf between my
love-making and yours. Yours--was romance; mine will be
prose. I'm not running it down--a very good kind of prose,
but well considered, well thought out. For instance, I know
all Mr. Wilcox's faults. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>)'s afraid of emotion. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) cares
too much about success, too little about the past. His (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>)
sympathy lacks poetry, and so isn't sympathy really. I'd
even say'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) looked at the shining lagoons--<div class="bookquote">``that,
spiritually, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>)'s not as honest as I am. Doesn't that
satisfy you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, it doesn't,''  (<font color='red'><b>Helen</b></font>)</div>said Helen. <div class="bookquote">``It makes me feel worse
and worse. You must be mad.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div><p/>Margaret made a movement of irritation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't intend him (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>), or any man or any woman, to be all
my life--good heavens, no! There are heaps of things in me
that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) doesn't, and shall never, understand.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Thus she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) spoke before the wedding ceremony and the
physical union, before the astonishing glass shade had
fallen that interposes between married couples and the
world. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) was to keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) independence more than do most
women as yet. Marriage was to alter her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) fortunes rather
than her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) character, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) was not far wrong in boasting
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) understood her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) future husband. Yet he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) did alter
her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) character--a little. There was an unforeseen surprise,
a cessation of the winds and odours of life, a social
pressure that would have her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) think conjugally.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) continued. <div class="bookquote">``There are heaps of
things in him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)--more especially things that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) does--that
will always be hidden from me. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has all those public
qualities which you so despise and enable all this--''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
waved her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) hand at the landscape, which confirmed anything.
<div class="bookquote">``If Wilcoxes hadn't worked and died in England for thousands
of years, you and I couldn't sit here without having our
throats cut. There would be no trains, no ships to carry us
literary people about in, no fields even. Just savagery.
No--perhaps not even that. Without their spirit life might
never have moved out of protoplasm. More and more do I
refuse to draw my income and sneer at those who guarantee
it. There are times when it seems to me--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And to me, and to all women. So one kissed Paul.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's brutal,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>said Margaret. <div class="bookquote">``Mine is an absolutely
different case. I've thought things out.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It makes no difference thinking things out. They come
to the same.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">'' Rubbish!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>There was a long silence, during which the tide returned
into Poole Harbour. <div class="bookquote">``One would lose something,''  (<font color='red'><b>Helen</b></font>)</div>murmured
Helen, apparently to herself. The water crept over the
mud-flats towards the gorse and the blackened heather.
Branksea Island lost its immense foreshores, and became a
sombre episode of trees. Frome was forced inward towards
Dorchester, Stour against Wimborne, Avon towards Salisbury,
and over the immense displacement the sun presided, leading
it to triumph ere he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) sank to rest. England was alive,
throbbing through all her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) estuaries, crying for joy through
the mouths of all her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) gulls, and the north wind, with
contrary motion, blew stronger against her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) rising seas.
What did it mean? For what end are her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) fair complexities,
her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) changes of soil, her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) sinuous coast? Does she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) belong to
those who have moulded her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) and made her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) feared by other
lands, or to those who have added nothing to her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) power, but
have somehow seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>), seen the whole island at once, lying
as a jewel in a silver sea, sailing as a ship of souls, with
all the brave world's fleet accompanying her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) towards
eternity?


<p/>Chapter 20

<p/>Margaret had often wondered at the disturbance that takes
place in the world's waters, when Love, who seems so tiny a
pebble, slips in. Whom does Love concern beyond the beloved
and the lover? Yet his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) impact deluges a hundred shores. No
doubt the disturbance is really the spirit of the
generations, welcoming the new generation, and chafing
against the ultimate Fate, who holds all the seas in the
palm of her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) hand. But Love cannot understand this. He (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>)
cannot comprehend another's infinity; he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) is conscious only
of his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) own--flying sunbeam, falling rose, pebble that asks
for one quiet plunge below the fretting interplay of space
and time. He (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) knows that he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) will survive at the end of
things, and be gathered by Fate as a jewel from the slime,
and be handed with admiration round the assembly of the
gods. <div class="bookquote">``Men did produce this,''  (<font color='red'><b>men</b></font>)</div>they will say, and, saying,
they will give men immortality. But meanwhile--what
agitations meanwhile! The foundations of Property and
Propriety are laid bare, twin rocks; Family Pride flounders
to the surface, puffing and blowing, and refusing to be
comforted; Theology, vaguely ascetic, gets up a nasty ground
swell. Then the lawyers are aroused--cold brood--and creep
out of their holes. They do what they can; they tidy up
Property and Propriety, reassure Theology and Family Pride.
Half-guineas are poured on the troubled waters, the lawyers
creep back, and, if all has gone well, Love joins one man
and woman together in Matrimony.

<p/>Margaret had expected the disturbance, and was not
irritated by it. For a sensitive woman she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had steady
nerves, and could bear with the incongruous and the
grotesque; and, besides, there was nothing excessive about
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) love-affair. Good-humour was the dominant note of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
relations with Mr. Wilcox, or, as I must now call him (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>),
Henry. Henry did not encourage romance, and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was no girl
to fidget for it. An acquaintance had become a lover, might
become a husband, but would retain all that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had noted in
the acquaintance; and love must confirm an old relation
rather than reveal a new one.

<p/>In this spirit she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) promised to marry him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>).

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) was in Swanage on the morrow, bearing the
engagement-ring. They greeted one another with a hearty
cordiality that impressed Aunt Juley. Henry dined at The
Bays, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) had engaged a bedroom in the principal hotel:
he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) was one of those men who knew the principal hotel by
instinct. After dinner he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) asked Margaret if she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) wouldn't
care for a turn on the Parade. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) accepted, and could not
repress a little tremor; it would be her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) first real love
scene. But as she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) put on her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) hat she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) burst out laughing.
Love was so unlike the article served up in books: the joy,
though genuine, was different; the mystery an unexpected
mystery. For one thing, Mr. Wilcox still seemed a stranger.

<p/>For a time they talked about the ring; then she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) said:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you remember the Embankment at Chelsea? It can't be
ten days ago.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) said, laughing. <div class="bookquote">``And you and your sister were
head and ears deep in some Quixotic scheme. Ah well!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I little thought then, certainly. Did you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know about that; I shouldn't like to say.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, was it earlier?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) cried. <div class="bookquote">``Did you think of me
this way earlier! How extraordinarily interesting, Henry!
Tell me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Henry</b></font>)</div><p/>But Henry had no intention of telling. Perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) could
not have told, for his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) mental states became obscure as soon
as he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) had passed through them. He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) misliked the very word
<div class="bookquote">``interesting,''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>connoting it with wasted energy and even with
morbidity. Hard facts were enough for him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I didn't think of it,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) pursued. <div class="bookquote">``No; when you
spoke to me in the drawing-room, that was practically the
first. It was all so different from what it's supposed to
be. On the stage, or in books, a proposal is--how shall I
put it? --a full-blown affair, a kind of bouquet; it loses
its literal meaning. But in life a proposal really is a proposal--''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``By the way--''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">''--a suggestion, a seed,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) concluded; and the thought
flew away into darkness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I was thinking, if you didn't mind, that we ought to
spend this evening in a business talk; there will be so much
to settle.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think so too. Tell me, in the first place, how did
you get on with Tibby?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``With your brother?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, during cigarettes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, very well.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am so glad,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) answered, a little surprised. <div class="bookquote">``What
did you talk about? Me, presumably.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``About Greece too.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Greece was a very good card, Henry. Tibby's only a boy
still, and one has to pick and choose subjects a little.
Well done.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``I was telling him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) I have shares in a currant-farm near Calamata.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What a delightful thing to have shares in! Can't we go
there for our honeymoon?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What to do?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To eat the currants. And isn't there marvellous scenery?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Moderately, but it's not the kind of place one could
possibly go to with a lady.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why not?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No hotels.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Some ladies do without hotels. Are you aware that
Helen and I have walked alone over the Apennines, with our
luggage on our backs?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wasn't aware, and, if I can manage it, you will never
do such a thing again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) said more gravely: <div class="bookquote">``You haven't found time for a
talk with Helen yet, I suppose?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do, before you go. I am so anxious you two should be friends.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Your sister and I have always hit it off,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) said
negligently. <div class="bookquote">``But we're drifting away from our business.
Let me begin at the beginning. You know that Evie is going
to marry Percy Cahill.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dolly's uncle.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Exactly. The girl's madly in love with him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>). A very
good sort of fellow, but he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) demands--and rightly--a suitable
provision with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). And in the second place, you will
naturally understand, there is Charles. Before leaving
town, I wrote Charles a very careful letter. You see, he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
has an increasing family and increasing expenses, and the I.
and W. A. is nothing particular just now, though capable of
development.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Poor fellow!''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>murmured Margaret, looking out to sea,
and not understanding.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Charles being the elder son, some day Charles will have
Howards End; but I am anxious, in my own happiness, not to
be unjust to others.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course not,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) began, and then gave a little cry.
<div class="bookquote">``You mean money. How stupid I am! Of course not!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Oddly enough, he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) winced a little at the word. <div class="bookquote">``Yes.
Money, since you put it so frankly. I am determined to be
just to all--just to you, just to them. I am determined
that my children shall have no case against me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Be generous to them,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) said sharply. <div class="bookquote">``Bother justice!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am determined--and have already written to Charles to
that effect--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But how much have you got?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How much have you a year? I've six hundred.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My income?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. We must begin with how much you have, before we
can settle how much you can give Charles. Justice, and even
generosity, depend on that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I must say you're a downright young woman,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)
observed, patting her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) arm and laughing a little. <div class="bookquote">``What a
question to spring on a fellow!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't you know your income? Or don't you want to tell
it me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I--''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's all right'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--now she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) patted him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)--<div class="bookquote">``don't tell me.
I don't want to know. I can do the sum just as well by
proportion. Divide your income into ten parts. How many
parts would you give to Evie, how many to Charles, how many
to Paul?''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The fact is, my dear, I hadn't any intention of
bothering you with details. I only wanted to let you know
that--well, that something must be done for the others, and
you've understood me perfectly, so let's pass on to the next
point.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, we've settled that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>said Margaret, undisturbed by
his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) strategic blunderings. <div class="bookquote">``Go ahead; give away all you
can, bearing in mind I've a clear six hundred. What a mercy
it is to have all this money about one!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``We've none too much, I assure you; you're marrying a
poor man.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Helen wouldn't agree with me here,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) continued.
``Helen daren't slang the rich, being rich herself, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>)
would like to. There's an odd notion, that I haven't yet
got hold of, running about at the back of her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) brain, that
poverty is somehow ``real.<div class="bookquote">'' She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) dislikes all organization,
and probably confuses wealth with the technique of wealth.
Sovereigns in a stocking wouldn't bother her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>); cheques do.
Helen is too relentless. One can't deal in her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) high-handed
manner with the world.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There's this other point, and then I must go back to my
hotel and write some letters. What's to be done now about
the house in Ducie Street?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Keep it on--at least, it depends. When do you want to
marry me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) raised her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) voice, as too often, and some youths, who
were also taking the evening air, overheard her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Getting a
bit hot, eh?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said one. Mr. Wilcox turned on them, and said
sharply, <div class="bookquote">``I say!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wilcox/Wilcox</b></font>)</div>There was silence. <div class="bookquote">``Take care I don't
report you to the police.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>They moved away quietly enough,
but were only biding their time, and the rest of the
conversation was punctuated by peals of ungovernable laughter.

<p/>Lowering his (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) voice and infusing a hint of reproof into
it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) said: <div class="bookquote">``Evie will probably be married in September.
We could scarcely think of anything before then.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The earlier the nicer, Henry. Females are not supposed
to say such things, but the earlier the nicer.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How about September for us too?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) asked, rather dryly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Right. Shall we go into Ducie Street ourselves in
September? Or shall we try to bounce Helen and Tibby into
it? That's rather an idea. They are so unbusinesslike, we
could make them do anything by judicious management. Look
here--yes. We'll do that. And we ourselves could live at
Howards End or Shropshire.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) blew out his (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) cheeks. <div class="bookquote">``Heavens! how you women do fly
round! My head's in a whirl. Point by point, Margaret.
Howards End's impossible. I let it to Hamar Bryce on a
three years' agreement last March. Don't you remember?
Oniton. Well, that is much, much too far away to rely on
entirely. You will be able to be down there entertaining a
certain amount, but we must have a house within easy reach
of Town. Only Ducie Street has huge drawbacks. There's a
mews behind.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div><p/>Margaret could not help laughing. It was the first she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
had heard of the mews behind Ducie Street. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) was a
possible tenant it had suppressed itself, not consciously,
but automatically. The breezy Wilcox manner, though
genuine, lacked the clearness of vision that is imperative
for truth. When Henry lived in Ducie Street he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) remembered
the mews; when he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) tried to let he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) forgot it; and if anyone
had remarked that the mews must be either there or not, he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)
would have felt annoyed, and afterwards have found some
opportunity of stigmatizing the speaker as academic. So
does my grocer stigmatize me when I complain of the quality
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) sultanas, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) answers in one breath that they are
the best sultanas, and how can I expect the best sultanas at
that price? It is a flaw inherent in the business mind, and
Margaret may do well to be tender to it, considering all
that the business mind has done for England.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, in summer especially, the mews is a serious
nuisance. The smoking room, too, is an abominable little
den. The house opposite has been taken by operatic people.
Ducie Street's going down, it's my private opinion.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How sad! It's only a few years since they built those
pretty houses.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Shows things are moving. Good for trade.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hate this continual flux of London. It is an epitome
of us at our worst--eternal formlessness; all the qualities,
good, bad, and indifferent, streaming away--streaming,
streaming for ever. That's why I dread it so. I mistrust
rivers, even in scenery. Now, the sea--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``High tide, yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hoy toid'' (<font color='red'><b>the youths</b></font>)</div>--from the promenading youths.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And these are the men to whom we give the vote,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wilcox/Wilcox</b></font>)</div>observed Mr. Wilcox, omitting to add that they were also the
men to whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) gave work as clerks--work that scarcely
encouraged them to grow into other men. <div class="bookquote">``However, they have
their own lives and interests. Let's get on.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) turned as he (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) spoke, and prepared to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) back to
The Bays. The business was over. His (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) hotel was in the
opposite direction, and if he (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) accompanied her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) letters
would be late for the post. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) implored him (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) not to come,
but he (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) was obdurate.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A nice beginning, if your aunt saw you slip in alone!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I always do go about alone. Considering I've
walked over the Apennines, it's common sense. You will make
me so angry. I don't the least take it as a compliment.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) laughed, and lit a cigar. <div class="bookquote">``It isn't meant as a
compliment, my dear. I just won't have you going about in
the dark. Such people about too! It's dangerous. ''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Can't I look after myself? I do wish--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Come along, Margaret; no wheedling.''

 (<font color='red'><b>A woman</b></font>)</div><p/>A younger woman might have resented his (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) masterly ways,
but Margaret had too firm a grip of life to make a fuss.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) was, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) own way, as masterly. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) was a fortress
she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) was a mountain peak, whom all might tread, but whom the
snows made nightly virginal. Disdaining the heroic outfit,
excitable in her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) methods, garrulous, episodical, shrill, she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
misled her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) lover much as she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) had misled her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) aunt. He (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>)
mistook her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) fertility for weakness. He (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) supposed her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``as
clever as they make 'em,''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>but no more, not realizing that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) was penetrating to the depths of his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) soul, and approving
of what she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) found there.

<p/>And if insight were sufficient, if the inner life were
the whole of life, their happiness has been assured.

<p/>They walked ahead briskly. The parade and the road
after it were well lighted, but it was darker in Aunt
Juley's garden. As they were going up by the side-paths,
through some rhododendrons, Mr. Wilcox, who was in front,
said <div class="bookquote">``Margaret''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wilcox/Wilcox</b></font>)</div>rather huskily, turned, dropped his (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) cigar,
and took her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) arms.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) was startled, and nearly screamed, but recovered
herself at once, and kissed with genuine love the lips that
were pressed against her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) own. It was their first kiss, and
when it was over he (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) safely to the door and rang the
bell for her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>), but disappeared into the night before the maid
answered it. On looking back, the incident displeased her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>).
It was so isolated. Nothing in their previous conversation
had heralded it, and, worse still, no tenderness had
ensued. If a man cannot lead up to passion he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) can at all
events lead down from it, and she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) had hoped, after her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>)
complaisance, for some interchange of gentle words. But he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
had hurried away as if ashamed, and for an instant she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) was
reminded of Helen and Paul.


<p/>Chapter 21

<p/>Charles had just been scolding his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) Dolly. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) deserved the
scolding, and had bent before it, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) head, though
bloody, was unsubdued, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) chirrupings began to mingle
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) retreating thunder.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You've woken the baby. I knew you would. -LRB-Rum-ti-foo,

down to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Percy</b></font>)? Who sent them out in the motor day after day?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Charles, that reminds me of some poem.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Does it indeed? We shall all be dancing to a very

on toast.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I could simply scratch that woman's eyes out, and to

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's your fault, and five months ago you admitted it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I didn't.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Tootle, tootle, playing on the pootle!''  (<font color='red'><b>Dolly</b></font>)</div>exclaimed
Dolly, suddenly devoting herself to the child.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's all very well to turn the conversation, but Father
would never have dreamt of marrying as long as Evie was
there to make him (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) comfortable. But you must needs start
match-making. Besides, Cahill's too old.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Schlegel always meant to get hold of Howards End,
and, thanks to you, she (<font color='blue'><b>Schlegel</b></font>)'s got it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I call the way you twist things round and make them

anxious to do the decent thing. But I do not intend to

their best behaviour--Dolly, are you listening? --we'll
behave, too. But if I find them giving themselves airs, or
monopolizing my father, or at all ill-treating him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), or
worrying him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) with their artistic beastliness, I intend to
put my foot down, yes, firmly. Taking my mother's place!
Heaven knows what poor old Paul will say when the news
reaches him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The interlude closes. It has taken place in Charles's
garden at Hilton. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) and Dolly are sitting in deck-chairs,
and their motor is regarding them placidly from its garage
across the lawn. A short-frocked edition of Charles also
regards them placidly; a perambulator edition is squeaking;
a third edition is expected shortly. Nature is turning out
Wilcoxes in this peaceful abode, so that they may inherit
the earth.


<p/>Chapter 22

<p/>Margaret greeted her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) lord with peculiar tenderness on the
morrow. Mature as he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) was, she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) might yet be able to help him (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>)
to the building of the rainbow bridge that should connect
the prose in us with the passion. Without it we are
meaningless fragments, half monks, half beasts, unconnected
arches that have never joined into a man. With it love is
born, and alights on the highest curve, glowing against the
grey, sober against the fire. Happy the man who sees from
either aspect the glory of these outspread wings. The roads
of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) soul lie clear, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) friends shall find easy-going.

<p/>It was hard-going in the roads of Mr. Wilcox's soul.
From boyhood he (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) had neglected them. <div class="bookquote">``I am not a fellow who
bothers about my own inside.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Outwardly he (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) was cheerful,
reliable, and brave; but within, all had reverted to chaos,
ruled, so far as it was ruled at all, by an incomplete
asceticism. Whether as boy, husband, or widower, he (<font color='blue'><b>widower</b></font>) had
always the sneaking belief that bodily passion is bad, a
belief that is desirable only when held passionately.
Religion had confirmed him (<font color='blue'><b>widower</b></font>). The words that were read aloud
on Sunday to him (<font color='blue'><b>widower</b></font>) and to other respectable men were the words
that had once kindled the souls of St. Catharine and St.
Francis into a white-hot hatred of the carnal. He (<font color='blue'><b>Francis</b></font>) could-not
be as the saints and love the Infinite with a seraphic
ardour, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Francis</b></font>) could be a little ashamed of loving a wife.
<div class="bookquote">``Amabat, amare timebat.''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>And it was here that Margaret
hoped to help him (<font color='blue'><b>Francis</b></font>).

<p/>It did not seem so difficult. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) need trouble him (<font color='blue'><b>Francis</b></font>) with
no gift of her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) own. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) would only point out the salvation
that was latent in his (<font color='blue'><b>Francis</b></font>) own soul, and in the soul of every
man. Only connect! That was the whole of her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) sermon. Only
connect the prose and the passion, and both will be exalted,
and human love will be seen at its height. Live in
fragments no longer. Only connect, and the beast and the
monk, robbed of the isolation that is life to either, will die.

<p/>Nor was the message difficult to give. It need not take
the form of a good <div class="bookquote">``talking.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>By quiet indications the
bridge would be built and span their lives with beauty.

<p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) failed. For there was one quality in Henry for
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) was never prepared, however much she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) reminded
herself of it: his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) obtuseness. He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) simply did not notice
things, and there was no more to be said. He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) never noticed
that Helen and Frieda were hostile, or that Tibby was not
interested in currant plantations; he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) never noticed the
lights and shades that exist in the grayest conversation,
the finger-posts, the milestones, the collisions, the
illimitable views. Once--on another occasion--she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) scolded
him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) about it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) was puzzled, but replied with a laugh: <div class="bookquote">``My
motto is Concentrate. I've no intention of frittering away
my strength on that sort of thing.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It isn't frittering
away the strength,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) protested. <div class="bookquote">``It's enlarging the
space in which you may be strong.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) answered: <div class="bookquote">``You're a
clever little woman, but my motto's Concentrate.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>And this
morning he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) concentrated with a vengeance.

<p/>They met in the rhododendrons of yesterday. In the
daylight the bushes were inconsiderable and the path was
bright in the morning sun. She (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) was with Helen, who had been
ominously quiet since the affair was settled. <div class="bookquote">``Here we all
are!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) cried, and took him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) by one hand, retaining her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>)
sister's in the other.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here we are. Good-morning, Helen.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Helen</b></font>)</div><p/>Helen replied, <div class="bookquote">``Good-morning, Mr. Wilcox.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Helen</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Henry, she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) has had such a nice letter from the queer,
cross boy--Do you remember him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)? He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) had a sad moustache, but
the back of his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) head was young.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have had a letter too. Not a nice one--I want to
talk it over with you:''  (<font color='red'><b>Leonard/Leonard Bast/Bast</b></font>)</div>for Leonard Bast was nothing to him (<font color='blue'><b>Bast</b></font>)
now that she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) had given him (<font color='blue'><b>Bast</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) word; the triangle of sex was
broken for ever.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thanks to your hint, he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)'s clearing out of the Porphyrion.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not a bad business that Porphyrion,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bast</b></font>) said absently,
as he (<font color='blue'><b>Bast</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>Bast</b></font>) own letter out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bast</b></font>) pocket.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not a BAD--''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) exclaimed, dropping his (<font color='blue'><b>Bast</b></font>) hand.
<div class="bookquote">``Surely, on Chelsea Embankment--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Here's our hostess. Good-morning, Mrs. Munt. Fine
rhododendrons. Good morning, Frau Liesecke; we manage to
grow flowers in England, don't we?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not a BAD business?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No. My letter's about Howards End. Bryce has been
ordered abroad, and wants to sublet it. I am far from sure
that I shall give him (<font color='blue'><b>Bryce</b></font>) permission. There was no clause in
the agreement. In my opinion, subletting is a mistake. If
he (<font color='blue'><b>Bryce</b></font>) can find me another tenant, whom I consider suitable, I
may cancel the agreement. Morning, Schlegel. Don't you
think that's better than subletting?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Helen</b></font>)</div><p/>Helen had dropped her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) hand now, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Bast</b></font>) had steered her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>)
past the whole party to the seaward side of the house.
Beneath them was the bourgeois little bay, which must have
yearned all through the centuries for just such a
watering-place as Swanage to be built on its margin. The
waves were colourless, and the Bournemouth steamer gave a
further touch of insipidity, drawn up against the pier and
hooting wildly for excursionists.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``When there is a sublet I find that damage--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do excuse me, but about the Porphyrion. I don't feel
easy--might I just bother you, Henry?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) manner was so serious that he (<font color='blue'><b>bourgeois</b></font>) stopped, and asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>)
a little sharply what she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) wanted.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You said on Chelsea Embankment, surely, that it was a
bad concern, so we advised this clerk to clear out. He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)
writes this morning that he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)'s taken our advice, and now you
say it's not a bad concern. ''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A clerk who clears out of any concern, good or bad,

Town, he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) says. The salary's much lower, but he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) hopes to
manage--a branch of Dempster's Bank. Is that all right?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dempster! My goodness me, yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If he (<font color='blue'><b>Dempster</b></font>) sublets, I shan't have the same control. In
theory there should be no more damage done at Howards End;

money can compensate. For instance, I shouldn't want that
fine wych-elm spoilt. It hangs--Margaret, we must go and
see the old place some time. It's pretty in its way. We'll
motor down and have lunch with Charles.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should enjoy that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>said Margaret bravely.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What about next Wednesday?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Wednesday? No, I couldn't well do that. Aunt Juley
expects us to stop here another week at least.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Er--no,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>said Margaret, after a moment's thought.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, that'll be all right. I'll speak to her (<font color='blue'><b>Juley</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``This visit is a high solemnity. My aunt counts on it

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>bourgeois</b></font>) left her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) to intercept Mrs. Munt, whose voice
could be heard in the distance: to be intercepted himself by
Helen.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Mr. Wilcox, about the Porphyrion--''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) began, and
went scarlet all over her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's all right,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>called Margaret, catching them up.
<div class="bookquote">``Dempster's Bank's better.''

consider it a deplorable misfortune.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wilcox/Wilcox</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Wilcox, intent on his (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) business with Mrs. Munt, was
going steadily on, but the last remark made him (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) say: <div class="bookquote">``What?

explain the point to you. It is like this. You seem to
assume, when a business concern is conducting a delicate

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wouldn't say that, but you're taking it far too
seriously. Who is this fellow?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We have told you about the fellow twice already,''  (<font color='red'><b>Helen</b></font>)</div>said
Helen. <div class="bookquote">``You have even met the fellow. He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) is very poor and
his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) wife is an extravagant imbecile. He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) is capable of
better things. We--we, the upper classes--thought we would
help him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) from the height of our superior knowledge--and
here's the result!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) finger. <div class="bookquote">``Now, a word of advice.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I require no more advice.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A word of advice. Don't take up that sentimental
attitude over the poor. See that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) doesn't, Margaret.
The poor are poor, and one's sorry for them, but there it
is. As civilization moves forward, the shoe is bound to
pinch in places, and it's absurd to pretend that anyone is
responsible personally. Neither you, nor I, nor my
informant, nor the man who informed him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), nor the directors
of the Porphyrion, are to blame for this clerk's loss of
salary. It's just the shoe pinching--no one can help it;
and it might easily have been worse.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Helen</b></font>)</div><p/>Helen quivered with indignation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``By all means subscribe to charities--subscribe to them

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Owing to God, I suppose,''  (<font color='red'><b>Helen</b></font>)</div>flashed Helen.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) stared at her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You grab the dollars. God does the rest.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div><p/>It was no good instructing the girl if she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) was going to
talk about God in that neurotic modern way. Fraternal to
the last, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) left her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) for the quieter company of Mrs. Munt.
He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) thought, <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) rather reminds me of Dolly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>Helen looked out at the sea.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't even discuss political economy with Henry,''
 (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div>advised her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) sister. <div class="bookquote">``It'll only end in a cry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) must be one of those men who have reconciled
science with religion,''  (<font color='red'><b>Helen</b></font>)</div>said Helen slowly. <div class="bookquote">``I don't like
those men. They are scientific themselves, and talk of the
survival of the fittest, and cut down the salaries of their
clerks, and stunt the independence of all who may menace
their comfort, but yet they believe that somehow good--and
it is always that sloppy `somehow'--will be the outcome, and
that in some mystical way the Mr. Basts of the future will
benefit because the Mr. Basts of today are in pain.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Basts</b></font>) is such a man in theory. But oh, Helen, in theory!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But oh, Meg, what a theory!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why should you put things so bitterly, dearie?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because I'm an old maid,''  (<font color='red'><b>Helen</b></font>)</div>said Helen, biting her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) lip.
<div class="bookquote">``I can't think why I go on like this myself.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) shook off
her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) sister's hand and went into the house. Margaret,
distressed at the day's beginning, followed the Bournemouth
steamer with her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) eyes. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) saw that Helen's nerves were
exasperated by the unlucky Bast business beyond the bounds
of politeness. There might at any minute be a real
explosion, which even Henry would notice. Henry must be removed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Margaret!''  (<font color='red'><b>aunt</b></font>)</div>her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) aunt called. <div class="bookquote">``Magsy! It isn't true,
surely, what Mr. Wilcox says, that you want to go away early
next week?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not `want,'''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>was Margaret's prompt reply; <div class="bookquote">``but there is
so much to be settled, and I do want to see the Charles'.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But going away without taking the Weymouth trip, or
even the Lulworth?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Munt</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Munt, coming nearer. <div class="bookquote">``Without
going once more up Nine Barrows Down?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm afraid so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wilcox/Wilcox</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Wilcox rejoined her (<font color='blue'><b>Munt</b></font>) with, <div class="bookquote">``Good! I did the breaking
of the ice.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>A wave of tenderness came over her (<font color='blue'><b>Munt</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Munt</b></font>) put a hand on
either shoulder, and looked deeply into the black, bright
eyes. What was behind their competent stare? She (<font color='blue'><b>Munt</b></font>) knew, but
was not disquieted.


<p/>Chapter 23

<p/>Margaret had no intention of letting things slide, and the
evening before she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) left Swanage she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) sister a
thorough scolding. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) censured her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>), not for disapproving
of the engagement, but for throwing over her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) disapproval a
veil of mystery. Helen was equally frank. <div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) said,
with the air of one looking inwards, <div class="bookquote">``there is a mystery. I
can't help it. It's not my fault. It's the way life has
been made.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Helen in those days was over-interested in the
subconscious self. She (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) exaggerated the Punch and Judy
aspect of life, and spoke of mankind as puppets, whom an
invisible showman twitches into love and war. Margaret
pointed out that if she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) dwelt on this she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>), too, would
eliminate the personal. Helen was silent for a minute, and
then burst into a queer speech, which cleared the air. <div class="bookquote">``Go
on and marry him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>). I think you're splendid; and if anyone
can pull it off, you will.''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>Margaret denied that there was
anything to <div class="bookquote">``pull off,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>but she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) continued: ``Yes, there is,
and I wasn't up to it with Paul. I can only do what's
easy. I can only entice and be enticed. I can't, and won't
attempt difficult relations. If I marry, it will either be
a man who's strong enough to boss me or whom I'm strong
enough to boss. So I shan't ever marry, for there aren't
such men. And Heaven help any one whom I do marry, for I
shall certainly run away from him (<font color='blue'><b>boss</b></font>) before you can say ``Jack
Robinson.<div class="bookquote">'' There! Because I'm uneducated. But you, you're
different; you're a heroine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jack Robinson</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Helen! Am I? Will it be as dreadful for poor
Henry as all that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You mean to keep proportion, and that's heroic, it's
Greek, and I don't see why it shouldn't succeed with you.
Go on and fight with him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) and help him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>). Don't ask ME for
help, or even for sympathy. Henceforward I'm going my own
way. I mean to be thorough, because thoroughness is easy.
I mean to dislike your husband, and to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) so. I mean
to make no concessions to Tibby. If Tibby wants to live
with me, he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) must lump me. I mean to love YOU more than
ever. Yes, I do. You and I have built up something real,
because it is purely spiritual. There's no veil of mystery
over us. Unreality and mystery begin as soon as one touches
the body. The popular view is, as usual, exactly the wrong
one. Our bothers are over tangible things--money, husbands,
house-hunting. But Heaven will work of itself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div><p/>Margaret was grateful for this expression of affection,
and answered, <div class="bookquote">``Perhaps.''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>All vistas close in the unseen--no
one doubts it--but Helen closed them rather too quickly for
her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) taste. At every turn of speech one was confronted with
reality and the absolute. Perhaps Margaret grew too old for
metaphysics, perhaps Henry was weaning her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) from them, but
she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) felt that there was something a little unbalanced in the
mind that so readily shreds the visible. The business man
who assumes that this life is everything, and the mystic who
asserts that it is nothing, fail, on this side and on that,
to hit the truth. <div class="bookquote">``Yes, I see, dear; it's about halfway
between,''  (<font color='red'><b>Aunt Juley/Juley</b></font>)</div>Aunt Juley had hazarded in earlier years. No;
truth, being alive, was not halfway between anything. It
was only to be found by continuous excursions into either
realm, and though proportion is the final secret, to espouse
it at the outset is to insure sterility.

<p/>Helen, agreeing here, disagreeing there, would have
talked till midnight, but Margaret, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) packing to do,
focussed the conversation on Henry. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) might abuse Henry
behind his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) back, but please would she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) always, be civil to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) in company? <div class="bookquote">``I definitely dislike him (<font color='blue'><b>bothers</b></font>), but I'll do what
I can,''  (<font color='red'><b>Helen</b></font>)</div>promised Helen. <div class="bookquote">``Do what you can with my friends in
return.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div><p/>This conversation made Margaret easier. Their inner
life was so safe that they could bargain over externals in a
way that would have been incredible to Aunt Juley, and
impossible for Tibby or Charles. There are moments when the
inner life actually <div class="bookquote">``pays,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>when years of self-scrutiny,
conducted for no ulterior motive, are suddenly of practical
use. Such moments are still rare in the West; that they
come at all promises a fairer future. Margaret, though
unable to understand her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) sister, was assured against
estrangement, and returned to London with a more peaceful mind.

<p/>The following morning, at eleven o'clock, she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) presented
herself at the offices of the Imperial and West African
Rubber Company. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) was glad to go there, for Henry had
implied his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) business rather than described it, and the
formlessness and vagueness that one associates with Africa
had hitherto brooded over the main sources of his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) wealth.
Not that a visit to the office cleared things up. There was
just the ordinary surface scum of ledgers and polished
counters and brass bars that began and stopped for no
possible reason, of electric-light globes blossoming in
triplets, of little rabbit hutches faced with glass or wire,
of little rabbits. And even when she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) penetrated to the
inner depths, she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) found only the ordinary table and Turkey
carpet, and though the map over the fireplace did depict a
helping of West Africa, it was a very ordinary map. Another
map hung opposite, on which the whole continent appeared,
looking like a whale marked out for blubber, and by its side
was a door, shut, but Henry's voice came through it,
dictating a <div class="bookquote">``strong''  (<font color='red'><b>Henry</b></font>)</div>letter. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) might have been at the
Porphyrion, or Dempster's Bank, or her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) own wine-merchant's.
Everything seems just alike in these days. But perhaps she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
was seeing the Imperial side of the company rather than its
West African, and Imperialism always had been one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
difficulties.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``One minute!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wilcox/Wilcox</b></font>)</div>called Mr. Wilcox on receiving her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) name.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) touched a bell, the effect of which was to produce Charles.

<p/>Charles had written his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) father an adequate letter--more
adequate than Evie's, through which a girlish indignation
throbbed. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) greeted his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) future stepmother with propriety.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope that my wife--how do you do? --will give you a
decent lunch,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) opening. <div class="bookquote">``I left instructions, but
we live in a rough-and-ready way. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) expects you back to
tea, too, after you have had a look at Howards End. I
wonder what you'll think of the place. I wouldn't touch it
with tongs myself. Do sit down! It's a measly little place.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall enjoy seeing it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>said Margaret, feeling, for
the first time, shy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You'll see it at its worst, for Bryce decamped abroad
last Monday without even arranging for a charwoman to clear
up after him (<font color='blue'><b>Bryce</b></font>). I never saw such a disgraceful mess. It's
unbelievable. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bryce</b></font>) wasn't in the house a month.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I've more than a little bone to pick with Bryce,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Henry</b></font>)</div>called Henry from the inner chamber.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why did he (<font color='blue'><b>Bryce</b></font>) go so suddenly?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Invalid type; couldn't sleep.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Poor fellow!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Poor fiddlesticks!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wilcox/Wilcox</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Wilcox, joining them. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)
had the impudence to put up notice-boards without as much as
saying with your leave or by your leave. Charles flung them
down.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I flung them down,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charles/Wilcox/Charles Wilcox</b></font>)</div>said Charles modestly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've sent a telegram after him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>), and a pretty sharp one,
too. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) in person is responsible for the upkeep of
that house for the next three years.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The keys are at the farm; we wouldn't have the keys.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Quite right.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dolly would have taken them, but I was in, fortunately.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What's Mr. Bryce like?''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>asked Margaret.

<p/>But nobody cared. Mr. Bryce was the tenant, who had no
right to sublet; to have defined him (<font color='blue'><b>Bryce</b></font>) further was a waste of
time. On his (<font color='blue'><b>Bryce</b></font>) misdeeds they descanted profusely, until the
girl who had been typing the strong letter came out with
it. Mr. Wilcox added his (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) signature. <div class="bookquote">``Now we'll be off,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>).

<p/>A motor-drive, a form of felicity detested by Margaret,
awaited her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>). Charles saw them in, civil to the last, and in
a moment the offices of the Imperial and West African Rubber
Company faded away. But it was not an impressive drive.
Perhaps the weather was to blame, being grey and banked high
with weary clouds. Perhaps Hertfordshire is scarcely
intended for motorists. Did not a gentleman once motor so
quickly through Westmoreland that he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) missed it? and if
Westmoreland can be missed, it will fare ill with a county
whose delicate structure particularly needs the attentive
eye. Hertfordshire is England at its quietest, with little
emphasis of river and hill; it is England meditative. If
Drayton were with us again to write a new edition of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
incomparable poem, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) would sing the nymphs of Hertfordshire
as indeterminate of feature, with hair obfuscated by the
London smoke. Their eyes would be sad, and averted from
their fate towards the Northern flats, their leader not Isis
or Sabrina, but the slowly flowing Lea. No glory of raiment
would be theirs, no urgency of dance; but they would be real
nymphs.

<p/>The chauffeur could not travel as quickly as he (<font color='blue'><b>chauffeur</b></font>) had
hoped, for the Great North Road was full of Easter traffic.
But he (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) went quite quick enough for Margaret, a poor-spirited
creature, who had chickens and children on the brain.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They're all right,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wilcox/Wilcox</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Wilcox. <div class="bookquote">``They'll
learn--like the swallows and the telegraph-wires.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, but, while they're learning--''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The motor's come to stay,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) answered. <div class="bookquote">``One must get
about. There's a pretty church--oh, you aren't sharp
enough. Well, look out, if the road worries you--right
outward at the scenery. ''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) looked at the scenery. It heaved and merged like
porridge. Presently it congealed. They had arrived.

<p/>Charles's house on the left; on the right the swelling
forms of the Six Hills. Their appearance in such a
neighbourhood surprised her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>). They interrupted the stream of
residences that was thickening up towards Hilton. Beyond
them she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) saw meadows and a wood, and beneath them she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
settled that soldiers of the best kind lay buried. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
hated war and liked soldiers--it was one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) amiable
inconsistencies.

<p/>But here was Dolly, dressed up to the nines, standing at
the door to greet them, and here were the first drops of the
rain. They ran in gaily, and after a long wait in the
drawing-room sat down to the rough-and-ready lunch, every
dish in which concealed or exuded cream. Mr. Bryce was the
chief topic of conversation. Dolly described his (<font color='blue'><b>Bryce</b></font>) visit with
the key, while her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) father-in-law gave satisfaction by
chaffing her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) and contradicting all she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) said. It was
evidently the custom to laugh at Dolly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bryce</b></font>) chaffed
Margaret, too, and Margaret, roused from a grave meditation,
was pleased, and chaffed him (<font color='blue'><b>Bryce</b></font>) back. Dolly seemed surprised,
and eyed her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) curiously. After lunch the two children came
down. Margaret disliked babies, but hit it off better with
the two-year-old, and sent Dolly into fits of laughter by
talking sense to him (<font color='blue'><b>Bryce</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Kiss them now, and come away,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wilcox/Wilcox</b></font>)</div>said
Mr. Wilcox. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) came, but refused to kiss them: it was such
hard luck on the little things, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) said, and though Dolly
proffered Chorly-worly and Porgly-woggles in turn, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) was obdurate.

<p/>By this time it was raining steadily. The car came
round with the hood up, and again she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) lost all sense of
space. In a few minutes they stopped, and Crane opened the
door of the car.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What's happened?''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>asked Margaret.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you suppose?''  (<font color='red'><b>Henry</b></font>)</div>said Henry.

<p/>A little porch was close up against her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are we there already?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We are.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I never! In years ago it seemed so far away.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Smiling, but somehow disillusioned, she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) jumped out, and
her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) impetus carried her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) to the front-door. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) was about to
open it, when Henry said: <div class="bookquote">``That's no good; it's locked.
Who's got the key?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Henry</b></font>)</div><p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) had himself forgotten to call for the key at the
farm, no one replied. He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) also wanted to know who had left
the front gate open, since a cow had strayed in from the
road, and was spoiling the croquet lawn. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) said
rather crossly: ``Margaret, you wait in the dry. I'll go
down for the key. It isn't a hundred yards.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mayn't I come too?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; I shall be back before I'm gone.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Then the car turned away, and it was as if a curtain had
risen. For the second time that day she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) saw the appearance
of the earth.

<p/>There were the greengage-trees that Helen had once
described, there the tennis lawn, there the hedge that would
be glorious with dog-roses in June, but the vision now was
of black and palest green. Down by the dell-hole more vivid
colours were awakening, and Lent Lilies stood sentinel on
its margin, or advanced in battalions over the grass.
Tulips were a tray of jewels. She (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) could not see the
wych-elm tree, but a branch of the celebrated vine, studded
with velvet knobs, had covered the porch. She (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) was struck by
the fertility of the soil; she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) had seldom been in a garden
where the flowers looked so well, and even the weeds she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) was
idly plucking out of the porch were intensely green. Why
had poor Mr. Bryce fled from all this beauty? For she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) had
already decided that the place was beautiful.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Naughty cow! Go away!''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>cried Margaret to the cow, but
without indignation.

<p/>Harder came the rain, pouring out of a windless sky, and
spattering up from the notice-boards of the house-agents,
which lay in a row on the lawn where Charles had hurled
them. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) must have interviewed Charles in another
world--where one did have interviews. How Helen would revel
in such a notion! Charles dead, all people dead, nothing
alive but houses and gardens. The obvious dead, the
intangible alive, and--no connection at all between them!
Margaret smiled. Would that her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) own fancies were as
clear-cut! Would that she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) could deal as high-handedly with
the world! Smiling and sighing, she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) laid her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) hand upon the
door. It opened. The house was not locked up at all.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) hesitated. Ought she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) to wait for Henry? He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) felt
strongly about property, and might prefer to show her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) over
himself. On the other hand, he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) had told her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) to keep in the
dry, and the porch was beginning to drip. So she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) went in,
and the drought from inside slammed the door behind.

<p/>Desolation greeted her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>). Dirty finger-prints were on the
hall-windows, flue and rubbish on its unwashed boards. The
civilization of luggage had been here for a month, and then
decamped. Dining-room and drawing room--right and
left--were guessed only by their wall-papers. They were
just rooms where one could shelter from the rain. Across
the ceiling of each ran a great beam. The dining-room and
hall revealed theirs openly, but the drawing-room's was
match-boarded--because the facts of life must be concealed
from ladies? Drawing-room, dining-room, and hall--how petty
the names sounded! Here were simply three rooms where
children could play and friends shelter from the rain. Yes,
and they were beautiful.

<p/>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) opened one of the doors opposite--there were
two--and exchanged wall-papers for whitewash. It was the
servants' part, though she (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) scarcely realized that: just
rooms again, where friends might shelter. The garden at the
back was full of flowering cherries and plums. Farther on
were hints of the meadow and a black cliff of pines. Yes,
the meadow was beautiful.

<p/>Penned in by the desolate weather, she (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) recaptured the
sense of space which the motor had tried to rob from her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>).
She (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) remembered again that ten square miles are not ten times
as wonderful as one square mile, that a thousand square
miles are not practically the same as heaven. The phantom
of bigness, which London encourages, was laid for ever when
she (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) paced from the hall at Howards End to its kitchen and
heard the rains run this way and that where the watershed of
the roof divided them.

<p/>Now Helen came to her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) mind, scrutinizing half Wessex
from the ridge of the Purbeck Downs, and saying: <div class="bookquote">``You will
have to lose something.''  (<font color='red'><b>Wessex</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) was not so sure. For instance,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) would double her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) kingdom by opening the door that
concealed the stairs.

<p/>Now she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) thought of the map of Africa; of empires; of her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>)
father; of the two supreme nations, streams of whose life
warmed her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) blood, but, mingling, had cooled her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) brain. She (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>)
paced back into the hall, and as she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) did so the house reverberated.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is that you, Henry?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) called.

<p/>There was no answer, but the house reverberated again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Henry, have you got in?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>But it was the heart of the house beating, faintly at
first, then loudly, martially. It dominated the rain.

<p/>It is the starved imagination, not the well-nourished,
that is afraid. Margaret flung open the door to the
stairs. A noise as of drums seemed to deafen her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>). A woman,
an old woman, was descending, with figure erect, with face
impassive, with lips that parted and said dryly:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! Well, I took you for Ruth Wilcox.''

 (<font color='red'><b>an woman</b></font>)</div><p/>Margaret stammered: <div class="bookquote">``I--Mrs. Wilcox--I?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In fancy, of course--in fancy. You had her (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) way of
walking. Good-day.''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>And the old woman passed out into the
rain.


<p/>Chapter 24

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) quite a turn,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wilcox/Wilcox</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Wilcox, when retailing
the incident to Dolly at tea-time. <div class="bookquote">``None of you girls have
any nerves, really. Of course, a word from me put it all
right, but silly old Miss Avery--she (<font color='blue'><b>Avery</b></font>) frightened you, didn't
she (<font color='blue'><b>Avery</b></font>), Margaret? There you stood clutching a bunch of weeds.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) might have said something, instead of coming down the
stairs with that alarming bonnet on. I passed her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) as I came
in. Enough to make the car shy. I believe Miss Avery goes
in for being a character; some old maids do.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) lit a
cigarette. <div class="bookquote">``It is their last resource. Heaven knows what
she (<font color='blue'><b>Avery</b></font>) was doing in the place; but that's Bryce's business, not
mine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wasn't as foolish as you suggest,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>said Margaret.
<div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Avery</b></font>) only startled me, for the house had been silent so long.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did you take her (<font color='blue'><b>Avery</b></font>) for a spook?''  (<font color='red'><b>Dolly</b></font>)</div>asked Dolly, for whom
<div class="bookquote">``spooks''  (<font color='red'><b>Dolly</b></font>)</div>and <div class="bookquote">``going to church''  (<font color='red'><b>Dolly</b></font>)</div>summarized the unseen.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not exactly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Avery</b></font>) really did frighten you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Henry</b></font>)</div>said Henry, who was far
from discouraging timidity in females. <div class="bookquote">``Poor Margaret! And
very naturally. Uneducated classes are so stupid.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is Miss Avery uneducated classes?''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>Margaret asked, and
found herself looking at the decoration scheme of Dolly's
drawing-room.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)'s just one of the crew at the farm. People like
that always assume things. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) assumed you'd know who she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
was. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) left all the Howards End keys in the front lobby,
and assumed that you'd seen them as you came in, that you'd
lock up the house when you'd done, and would bring them on
down to her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>). And there was her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) niece hunting for them down
at the farm. Lack of education makes people very casual.
Hilton was full of women like Miss Avery once.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shouldn't have disliked it, perhaps.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Or Miss Avery giving me a wedding present,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dolly</b></font>)</div>said Dolly.

<p/>Which was illogical but interesting. Through Dolly,
Margaret was destined to learn a good deal.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But Charles said I must try not to mind, because she (<font color='blue'><b>Avery</b></font>)
had known his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) grandmother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``As usual, you've got the story wrong, my good Dorothea.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I mean great-grandmother--the one who left Mrs. Wilcox
the house. Weren't both of them and Miss Avery friends when
Howards End, too, was a farm?''

 (<font color='red'><b>father-in-law</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) father-in-law blew out a shaft of smoke. His (<font color='blue'><b>father-in-law</b></font>)
attitude to his (<font color='blue'><b>father-in-law</b></font>) dead wife was curious. He (<font color='blue'><b>father-in-law</b></font>) would allude to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>), and hear her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) discussed, but never mentioned her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) by
name. Nor was he (<font color='blue'><b>father-in-law</b></font>) interested in the dim, bucolic past.
Dolly was--for the following reason.

<p/>``Then hadn't Mrs. Wilcox a brother--or was it an uncle?
Anyhow, he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) popped the question, and Miss Avery, she (<font color='blue'><b>Avery</b></font>) said
``No.'' Just imagine, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>)'d said ``Yes,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) would have been
Charles's aunt. -LRB-Oh, I say,--that's rather good! <div class="bookquote">``Charlie's
Aunt'! I must chaff him (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) about that this evening.-RRB- And the
man went out and was killed. Yes, I'm certain I've got it
right now. Tom Howard--he (<font color='blue'><b>Howard</b></font>) was the last of them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I believe so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wilcox/Wilcox</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Wilcox negligently.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I say! Howards End--Howard's Ended!''  (<font color='red'><b>Dolly</b></font>)</div>cried Dolly.
<div class="bookquote">``I'm rather on the spot this evening, eh?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish you'd ask whether Crane's ended.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Mr. Wilcox, how CAN you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) has had enough tea, we ought to
go.--Dolly's a good little woman,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) continued, <div class="bookquote">``but a
little of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) goes a long way. I couldn't live near her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) if
you paid me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Margaret smiled. Though presenting a firm front to
outsiders, no Wilcox could live near, or near the
possessions of, any other Wilcox. They had the colonial
spirit, and were always making for some spot where the white
man might carry his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) burden unobserved. Of course, Howards
End was impossible, so long as the younger couple were
established in Hilton. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) objections to the house were
plain as daylight now.

<p/>Crane had had enough tea, and was sent to the garage,
where their car had been trickling muddy water over
Charles's. The downpour had surely penetrated the Six Hills
by now, bringing news of our restless civilization.
<div class="bookquote">``Curious mounds,''  (<font color='red'><b>Henry</b></font>)</div>said, Henry, <div class="bookquote">``but in with you now; another
time.''  (<font color='red'><b>Henry</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) had to be up in London by seven--if possible, by
six-thirty. Once more she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lost the sense of space; once
more trees, houses, people, animals, hills, merged and
heaved into one dirtiness, and she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was at Wickham Place.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) evening was pleasant. The sense of flux which had
haunted her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) all the year disappeared for a time. She (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) forgot
the luggage and the motor-cars, and the hurrying men who
know so much and connect so little. She (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) recaptured the
sense of space, which is the basis of all earthly beauty,
and, starting from Howards End, she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) attempted to realize
England. She (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) failed--visions do not come when we try,
though they may come through trying. But an unexpected love
of the island awoke in her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), connecting on this side with the
joys of the flesh, on that with the inconceivable. Helen
and her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) father had known this love, poor Leonard Bast was
groping after it, but it had been hidden from Margaret till
this afternoon. It had certainly come through the house and
old Miss Avery. Through them: the notion of <div class="bookquote">``through''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>persisted; her (<font color='blue'><b>Avery</b></font>) mind trembled towards a conclusion which only
the unwise have put into words. Then, veering back into
warmth, it dwelt on ruddy bricks, flowering plum-trees, and
all the tangible joys of, spring.

<p/>Henry, after allaying her (<font color='blue'><b>Avery</b></font>) agitation, had taken her (<font color='blue'><b>Avery</b></font>) over
his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) property, and had explained to her (<font color='blue'><b>Avery</b></font>) the use and
dimensions of the various rooms. He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) had sketched the
history of the little estate. <div class="bookquote">``It is so unlucky,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>ran the
monologue, <div class="bookquote">``that money wasn't put into it about fifty years
ago. Then it had four--five-times the land--thirty acres at
least. One could have made something out of it then--a
small park, or at all events shrubberies, and rebuilt the
house farther away from the road. What's the good of taking
it in hand now? Nothing but the meadow left, and even that
was heavily mortgaged when I first had to do with
things--yes, and the house too. Oh, it was no joke.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Avery</b></font>)
saw two women as he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) spoke, one old, the other young,
watching their inheritance melt away. She (<font color='blue'><b>Avery</b></font>) saw them greet
him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) as a deliverer. ``Mismanagement did it--besides, the
days for small farms are over. It doesn't pay--except with
intensive cultivation. Small holdings, back to the
land--ah! philanthropic bunkum. Take it as a rule that
nothing pays on a small scale. Most of the land you see
-LRB-they were standing at an upper window, the only one which
faced west-RRB- belongs to the people at the Park--they made
their pile over copper--good chaps. Avery's Farm,
Sishe's--what they call the Common, where you see that
ruined oak--one after the other fell in, and so did this, as
near as is no matter. ``But Henry had saved it; without fine
feelings or deep insight, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) had saved it, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Avery</b></font>) loved
him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) for the deed. <div class="bookquote">``When I had more control I did what I
could: sold off the two and a half animals, and the mangy
pony, and the superannuated tools; pulled down the
outhouses; drained; thinned out I don't know how many
guelder-roses and elder-trees; and inside the house I turned
the old kitchen into a hall, and made a kitchen behind where
the dairy was. Garage and so on came later. But one could
still tell it's been an old farm. And yet it isn't the
place that would fetch one of your artistic crew.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>No, it
wasn't; and if he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) did not quite understand it, the artistic
crew would still less: it was English, and the wych-elm that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Avery</b></font>) saw from the window was an English tree. No report had
prepared her (<font color='blue'><b>Avery</b></font>) for its peculiar glory. It was neither
warrior, nor lover, nor god; in none of these roles do the
English excel. It was a comrade, bending over the house,
strength and adventure in its roots, but in its utmost
fingers tenderness, and the girth, that a dozen men could
not have spanned, became in the end evanescent, till pale
bud clusters seemed to float in the air. It was a comrade.
House and tree transcended any similes of sex. Margaret
thought of them now, and was to think of them through many a
windy night and London day, but to compare either to man, to
woman, always dwarfed the vision. Yet they kept within
limits of the human. Their message was not of eternity, but
of hope on this side of the grave. As she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) stood in the one,
gazing at the other, truer relationship had gleamed.

<p/>Another touch, and the account of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) day is finished.
They entered the garden for a minute, and to Mr. Wilcox's
surprise she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was right. Teeth, pigs' teeth, could be seen
in the bark of the wych-elm tree--just the white tips of
them showing. <div class="bookquote">``Extraordinary!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) cried. <div class="bookquote">``Who told you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I heard of it one winter in London,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>was her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) answer,
for she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), too, avoided mentioning Mrs. Wilcox by name.


<p/>Chapter 25

<p/>Evie heard of her (<font color='blue'><b>Evie</b></font>) father's engagement when she (<font color='blue'><b>Evie</b></font>) was in for a
tennis tournament, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Evie</b></font>) play went simply to pot. That
she (<font color='blue'><b>Evie</b></font>) should marry and leave him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had seemed natural enough;
that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), left alone, should do the same was deceitful; and
now Charles and Dolly said that it was all her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) fault. <div class="bookquote">``But
I never dreamt of such a thing,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) grumbled. <div class="bookquote">``Dad took me
to call now and then, and made me ask her (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) to Simpson's.
Well, I'm altogether off Dad.''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>It was also an insult to
their mother's memory; there they were agreed, and Evie had
the idea of returning Mrs. Wilcox's lace and jewellery <div class="bookquote">``as a
protest.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Wilcox/Mrs. Warrington/Wilcox</b></font>)</div>Against what it would protest she (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) was not clear;
but being only eighteen, the idea of renunciation appealed
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>), the more as she (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) did not care for jewellery or lace.
Dolly then suggested that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) and Uncle Percy should pretend
to break off their engagement, and then perhaps Mr. Wilcox
would quarrel with Miss Schlegel, and break off his (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>); or Paul
might be cabled for. But at this point Charles told them
not to talk nonsense. So Evie settled to marry as soon as
possible; it was no good hanging about with these Schlegels
eyeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Evie</b></font>). The date of her (<font color='blue'><b>Evie</b></font>) wedding was consequently put
forward from September to August, and in the intoxication of
presents she (<font color='blue'><b>Evie</b></font>) recovered much of her (<font color='blue'><b>Evie</b></font>) good-humour.

<p/>Margaret found that she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) was expected to figure at this
function, and to figure largely; it would be such an
opportunity, said Henry, for her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) to get to know his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) set.
Sir James Bidder would be there, and all the Cahills and the
Fussells, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Bidder</b></font>) sister-in-law, Mrs. Warrington Wilcox, had
fortunately got back from her (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) tour round the world. Henry
she (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) loved, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) set promised to be another matter. He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)
had not the knack of surrounding himself with nice
people--indeed, for a man of ability and virtue his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) choice
had been singularly unfortunate; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had no guiding principle
beyond a certain preference for mediocrity; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was content
to settle one of the greatest things in life haphazard, and
so, while his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) investments went right, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) friends generally
went wrong. She (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) would be told, <div class="bookquote">``Oh, So-and-so's a good
sort--a thundering good sort,''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>and find, on meeting him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>),
that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was a brute or a bore. If Henry had shown real
affection, she (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) would have understood, for affection explains
everything. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) seemed without sentiment. The
<div class="bookquote">``thundering good sort''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>might at any moment become <div class="bookquote">``a fellow
for whom I never did have much use, and have less now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>and
be shaken off cheerily into oblivion. Margaret had done the
same as a schoolgirl. Now she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) never forgot anyone for whom
she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) had once cared; she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) connected, though the connection
might be bitter, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) hoped that some day Henry would do
the same.

<p/>Evie was not to be married from Ducie Street. She (<font color='blue'><b>Evie</b></font>) had a
fancy for something rural, and, besides, no one would be in
London then, so she (<font color='blue'><b>Evie</b></font>) left her (<font color='blue'><b>Evie</b></font>) boxes for a few weeks at Oniton
Grange, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Evie</b></font>) banns were duly published in the parish
church, and for a couple of days the little town, dreaming
between the ruddy hills, was roused by the clang of our
civilization, and drew up by the roadside to let the motors
pass. Oniton had been a discovery of Mr. Wilcox's--a
discovery of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) was not altogether proud. It was up
towards the Welsh border, and so difficult of access that he (<font color='blue'><b>Welsh</b></font>)
had concluded it must be something special. A ruined castle
stood in the grounds. But having got there, what was one to
do? The shooting was bad, the fishing indifferent, and
women-folk reported the scenery as nothing much. The place
turned out to be in the wrong part of Shropshire, damn it,
and though he (<font color='blue'><b>Welsh</b></font>) never damned his (<font color='blue'><b>Welsh</b></font>) own property aloud, he (<font color='blue'><b>Welsh</b></font>) was
only waiting to get it off his (<font color='blue'><b>Welsh</b></font>) hands, and then to let fly.
Evie's marriage was its last appearance in public. As soon
as a tenant was found, it became a house for which he (<font color='blue'><b>Welsh</b></font>) never
had had much use, and had less now, and, like Howards End,
faded into Limbo.

<p/>But on Margaret Oniton was destined to make a lasting
impression. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) regarded it as her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) future home, and was
anxious to start straight with the clergy, etc., and, if
possible, to see something of the local life. It was a
market-town--as tiny a one as England possesses--and had for
ages served that lonely valley, and guarded our marches
against the Kelt. In spite of the occasion, in spite of the
numbing hilarity that greeted her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) got into
the reserved saloon at Paddington, her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) senses were awake and
watching, and though Oniton was to prove one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
innumerable false starts, she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) never forgot it, nor the
things that happened there.

<p/>The London party only numbered eight--the Fussells,
father and son, two Anglo-Indian ladies named Mrs.
Plynlimmon and Lady Edser, Mrs. Warrington Wilcox and her (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>)
daughter, and lastly, the little girl, very smart and quiet,
who figures at so many weddings, and who kept a watchful eye
on Margaret, the bride-elect, Dolly was absent--a domestic
event detained her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) at Hilton; Paul had cabled a humorous
message; Charles was to meet them with a trio of motors at
Shrewsbury. Helen had refused her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) invitation; Tibby had
never answered his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>). The management was excellent, as was to
be expected with anything that Henry undertook; one was
conscious of his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) sensible and generous brain in the
background. They were his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) guests as soon as they reached
the train; a special label for their luggage; a courier; a
special lunch; they had only to look pleasant and, where
possible, pretty. Margaret thought with dismay of her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) own
nuptials--presumably under the management of Tibby. <div class="bookquote">``Mr.
Theobald Schlegel and Miss Helen Schlegel request the
pleasure of Mrs. Plynlimmon's company on the occasion of the
marriage of their sister Margaret.''  (<font color='red'><b>Wickham Place/Wickham</b></font>)</div>The formula was
incredible, but it must soon be printed and sent, and though
Wickham Place need not compete with Oniton, it must feed its
guests properly, and provide them with sufficient chairs.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) wedding would either be ramshackly or bourgeois--she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
hoped the latter. Such an affair as the present, staged
with a deftness that was almost beautiful, lay beyond her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
powers and those of her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) friends.

<p/>The low rich purr of a Great Western express is not the
worst background for conversation, and the journey passed
pleasantly enough. Nothing could have exceeded the kindness
of the two men. They raised windows for some ladies, and
lowered them for others, they rang the bell for the servant,
they identified the colleges as the train slipped past
Oxford, they caught books or bag-purses in the act of
tumbling on to the floor. Yet there was nothing finicky
about their politeness: it had the Public School touch, and,
though sedulous, was virile. More battles than Waterloo
have been won on our playing-fields, and Margaret bowed to a
charm of which she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) did not wholly approve, and said nothing
when the Oxford colleges were identified wrongly. <div class="bookquote">``Male and
female created He (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) them'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>; the journey to Shrewsbury confirmed
this questionable statement, and the long glass saloon, that
moved so easily and felt so comfortable, became a
forcing-house for the idea of sex.

<p/>At Shrewsbury came fresh air. Margaret was all for
sight-seeing, and while the others were finishing their tea
at the Raven, she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) annexed a motor and hurried over the
astonishing city. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) chauffeur was not the faithful Crane,
but an Italian, who dearly loved making her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) late. Charles,
watch in hand, though with a level brow, was standing in
front of the hotel when they returned. It was perfectly all
right, he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) told her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) was by no means the last. And then
he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) dived into the coffee-room, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) say, <div class="bookquote">``For
God's sake, hurry the women up; we shall never be off,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>and
Albert Fussell reply, <div class="bookquote">``Not I; I've done my share,''  (<font color='red'><b>Albert Fussell/Albert/Fussell</b></font>)</div>and
Colonel Fussell opine that the ladies were getting
themselves up to kill. Presently Myra -LRB-Mrs. Warrington's
daughter-RRB- appeared, and as she (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) was his (<font color='blue'><b>Fussell</b></font>) cousin, Charles blew
her (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) up a little: she (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) had been changing her (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) smart traveling
hat for a smart motor hat. Then Mrs. Warrington herself,
leading the quiet child; the two Anglo-Indian ladies were
always last. Maids, courier, heavy luggage, had already
gone on by a branch-line to a station nearer Oniton, but
there were five hat-boxes and four dressing-bags to be
packed, and five dust-cloaks to be put on, and to be put off
at the last moment, because Charles declared them not
necessary. The men presided over everything with unfailing
good-humour. By half-past five the party was ready, and
went out of Shrewsbury by the Welsh Bridge.

<p/>Shropshire had not the reticence of Hertfordshire.
Though robbed of half its magic by swift movement, it still
conveyed the sense of hills. They were nearing the
buttresses that force the Severn eastern and make it an
English stream, and the sun, sinking over the Sentinels of
Wales, was straight in their eyes. Having picked up another
guest, they turned southward, avoiding the greater
mountains, but conscious of an occasional summit, rounded
and mild, whose colouring differed in quality from that of
the lower earth, and whose contours altered more slowly.
Quiet mysteries were in progress behind those tossing
horizons: the West, as ever, was retreating with some secret
which may not be worth the discovery, but which no practical
man will ever discover.

<p/>They spoke of Tariff Reform.

<p/>Mrs. Warrington was just back from the Colonies. Like
many other critics of Empire, her (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) mouth had been stopped
with food, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) could only exclaim at the hospitality
with which she (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) had been received, and warn the Mother
Country against trifling with young Titans. <div class="bookquote">``They threaten
to cut the painter,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) cried, <div class="bookquote">``and where shall we be
then? Miss Schlegel, you'll undertake to keep Henry sound
about Tariff Reform? It is our last hope.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Margaret playfully confessed herself on the other side,
and they began to quote from their respective hand-books
while the motor carried them deep into the hills. Curious
these were, rather than impressive, for their outlines
lacked beauty, and the pink fields--on their summits
suggested the handkerchiefs of a giant spread out to dry.
An occasional outcrop of rock, an occasional wood, an
occasional <div class="bookquote">``forest,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>treeless and brown, all hinted at
wildness to follow, but the main colour was an agricultural
green. The air grew cooler; they had surmounted the last
gradient, and Oniton lay below them with its church, its
radiating houses, its castle, its river-girt peninsula.
Close to the castle was a grey mansion, unintellectual but
kindly, stretching with its grounds across the peninsula's
neck--the sort of mansion that was built all over England in
the beginning of the last century, while architecture was
still an expression of the national character. That was the
Grange, remarked Albert, over his (<font color='blue'><b>Albert</b></font>) shoulder, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Albert</b></font>)
jammed the brake on, and the motor slowed down and stopped.
<div class="bookquote">``I'm sorry,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Albert</b></font>), turning round. <div class="bookquote">``Do you mind getting
out--by the door on the right? Steady on!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What's happened?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Wilcox/Mrs. Warrington/Wilcox</b></font>)</div>asked Mrs. Warrington.

<p/>Then the car behind them drew up, and the voice of
Charles was heard saying: <div class="bookquote">``Get out the women at once.''  (<font color='red'><b>Charles/Wilcox/Charles Wilcox</b></font>)</div>There
was a concourse of males, and Margaret and her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) companions
were hustled out and received into the second car. What had
happened? As it started off again, the door of a cottage
opened, and a girl screamed wildly at them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is it?''  (<font color='red'><b>the ladies</b></font>)</div>the ladies cried.

<p/>Charles drove them a hundred yards without speaking.
Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) said: <div class="bookquote">``It's all right. Your car just touched a dog.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But stop!''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>cried Margaret, horrified.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It didn't hurt him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Didn't really hurt him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Myra</b></font>)</div>asked Myra.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do PLEASE stop!''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>said Margaret, leaning forward. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
was standing up in the car, the other occupants holding her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
knees to steady her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I want to go back, please.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charles/Wilcox/Charles Wilcox</b></font>)</div><p/>Charles took no notice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We've left Mr. Fussell behind,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said another; <div class="bookquote">``and
Angelo, and Crane.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, but no woman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I expect a little of'' (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Wilcox/Mrs. Warrington/Wilcox</b></font>)</div>--Mrs. Warrington scratched her (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>)
palm--<div class="bookquote">'' will be more to the point than one of us!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Wilcox/Mrs. Warrington/Wilcox</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The insurance company sees to that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charles/Wilcox/Charles Wilcox</b></font>)</div>remarked Charles,
<div class="bookquote">``and Albert will do the talking.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charles/Wilcox/Charles Wilcox</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I want to go back, though, I say!''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>repeated Margaret,
getting angry.

<p/>Charles took no notice. The motor, loaded with
refugees, continued to travel very slowly down the hill.
<div class="bookquote">``The men are there,''  (<font color='red'><b>the others</b></font>)</div>chorused the others. <div class="bookquote">``Men will see to it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``The men CAN<div class="bookquote">``T see to it. Oh, this is ridiculous!
Charles, I ask you to stop.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Stopping's no good,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charles/Wilcox/Charles Wilcox</b></font>)</div>drawled Charles.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Isn't it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>said Margaret, and jumped straight out of
the car.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) fell on her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) knees, cut her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) gloves, shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) hat
over her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) ear. Cries of alarm followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``You've hurt
yourself,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charles/Wilcox/Charles Wilcox</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Charles, jumping after her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course I've hurt myself!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) retorted.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``May I ask what--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There's nothing to ask,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>said Margaret.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your hand's bleeding.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm in for a frightful row from the pater.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You should have thought of that sooner, Charles.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charles/Wilcox/Charles Wilcox</b></font>)</div><p/>Charles had never been in such a position before. It
was a woman in revolt who was hobbling away from him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>), and
the sight was too strange to leave any room for anger. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
recovered himself when the others caught them up: their sort
he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) understood. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) commanded them to go back.

<p/>Albert Fussell was seen walking towards them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's all right!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Fussell</b></font>) called. <div class="bookquote">``It wasn't a dog, it was a
cat.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There!''  (<font color='red'><b>Charles/Wilcox/Charles Wilcox</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Charles triumphantly. ``It's only a
rotten cat.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Got room in your car for a little un? I cut as soon as
I saw it wasn't a dog; the chauffeurs are tackling the
girl.''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>But Margaret walked forward steadily. Why should
the chauffeurs tackle the girl? Ladies sheltering behind
men, men sheltering behind servants--the whole system's
wrong, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) must challenge it.

<p/>``Miss Schlegel! <div class="bookquote">``Pon my word, you've hurt your hand.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm just going to see,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>said Margaret. <div class="bookquote">``Don't you
wait, Mr. Fussell.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The second motor came round the corner. <div class="bookquote">``lt is all
right, madam,''  (<font color='red'><b>Crane</b></font>)</div>said Crane in his (<font color='blue'><b>Crane</b></font>) turn. He (<font color='blue'><b>Crane</b></font>) had taken to
calling her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) madam.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What's all right? The cat?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, madam. The girl will receive compensation for it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was a very ruda girla,''  (<font color='red'><b>Angelo</b></font>)</div>said Angelo from the third
motor thoughtfully.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Wouldn't you have been rude?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The Italian spread out his (<font color='blue'><b>Angelo</b></font>) hands, implying that he (<font color='blue'><b>Angelo</b></font>) had
not thought of rudeness, but would produce it if it pleased
her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>). The situation became absurd. The gentlemen were again
buzzing round Miss Schlegel with offers of assistance, and
Lady Edser began to bind up her (<font color='blue'><b>Edser</b></font>) hand. She (<font color='blue'><b>Edser</b></font>) yielded,
apologizing slightly, and was led back to the car, and soon
the landscape resumed its motion, the lonely cottage
disappeared, the castle swelled on its cushion of turf, and
they had arrived. No doubt she (<font color='blue'><b>Edser</b></font>) had disgraced herself. But
she (<font color='blue'><b>Edser</b></font>) felt their whole journey from London had been unreal.
They had no part with the earth and its emotions. They were
dust, and a stink, and cosmopolitan chatter, and the girl
whose cat had been killed had lived more deeply than they.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Henry,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) exclaimed, <div class="bookquote">``I have been so naughty,''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>for she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had decided to take up this line. <div class="bookquote">``We ran over a
cat. Charles told me not to jump out, but I would, and
look!''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) held out her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) bandaged hand. <div class="bookquote">``Your poor Meg went
such a flop.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wilcox/Wilcox</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Wilcox looked bewildered. In evening dress, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) was
standing to welcome his (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) guests in the hall.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thinking it was a dog,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Wilcox/Mrs. Warrington/Wilcox</b></font>)</div>added Mrs. Warrington.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, a dog's a companion!''  (<font color='red'><b>Colonel</b></font>)</div>said Colonel Fussell. <div class="bookquote">``A
dog'll remember you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you hurt yourself, Margaret?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not to speak about; and it's my left hand.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, hurry up and change.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Warrington</b></font>) obeyed, as did the others. Mr. Wilcox then turned
to his (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) son.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, Charles, what's happened?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charles/Wilcox/Charles Wilcox</b></font>)</div><p/>Charles was absolutely honest. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) described what he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
believed to have happened. Albert had flattened out a cat,
and Miss Schlegel had lost her (<font color='blue'><b>Schlegel</b></font>) nerve, as any woman might.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Schlegel</b></font>) had been got safely into the other car, but when it was
in motion had leapt out--again, in spite of all that they
could say. After walking a little on the road, she (<font color='blue'><b>Schlegel</b></font>) had
calmed down and had said that she (<font color='blue'><b>Schlegel</b></font>) was sorry. His (<font color='blue'><b>Albert</b></font>) father
accepted this explanation, and neither knew that Margaret
had artfully prepared the way for it. It fitted in too well
with their view of feminine nature. In the smoking-room,
after dinner, the Colonel put forward the view that Miss
Schlegel had jumped it out of devilry. Well he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) remembered
as a young man, in the harbour of Gibraltar once, how a
girl--a handsome girl, too--had jumped overboard for a bet.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) could see her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) now, and all the lads overboard after her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>).
But Charles and Mr. Wilcox agreed it was much more probably
nerves in Miss Schlegel's case. Charles was depressed.
That woman had a tongue. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would bring worse disgrace on
his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) father before she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had done with them. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) strolled out
on to the castle mound to think the matter over. The
evening was exquisite. On three sides of him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) a little river
whispered, full of messages from the west; above his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) head
the ruins made patterns against the sky. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) carefully
reviewed their dealings with this family, until he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) fitted
Helen, and Margaret, and Aunt Juley into an orderly
conspiracy. Paternity had made him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) suspicious. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) had two
children to look after, and more coming, and day by day they
seemed less likely to grow up rich men. <div class="bookquote">``It is all very
well,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) reflected, <div class="bookquote">``the pater saying that he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) will be just
to all, but one can't be just indefinitely. Money isn't
elastic. What's to happen if Evie has a family? And, come
to that, so may the pater. There'll not be enough to go
round, for there's none coming in, either through Dolly or
Percy. It's damnable!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) looked enviously at the Grange,
whose windows poured light and laughter. First and last,
this wedding would cost a pretty penny. Two ladies were
strolling up and down the garden terrace, and as the
syllables <div class="bookquote">``Imperialism''  (<font color='red'><b>ladies</b></font>)</div>were wafted to his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) ears, he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) guessed
that one of them was his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) aunt. She (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) might have helped him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>),
if she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) too had not had a family to provide for. <div class="bookquote">``Every one
for himself,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) repeated--a maxim which had cheered him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) in
the past, but which rang grimly enough among the ruins of
Oniton. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) lacked his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) father's ability in business, and so
had an ever higher regard for money; unless he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) could inherit
plenty, he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) feared to leave his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) children poor.

<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) sat thinking, one of the ladies left the terrace
and walked into the meadow; he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) recognized her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) as Margaret by
the white bandage that gleamed on her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) arm, and put out his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
cigar, lest the gleam should betray him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) climbed up the
mound in zigzags, and at times stooped down, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) was
stroking the turf. It sounds absolutely incredible, but for
a moment Charles thought that she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) was in love with him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>), and
had come out to tempt him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>). Charles believed in temptresses,
who are indeed the strong man's necessary complement, and
having no sense of humour, he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) could not purge himself of the
thought by a smile. Margaret, who was engaged to his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
father, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) sister's wedding-guest, kept on her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) way
without noticing him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) admitted that he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) had wronged
her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) on this point. But what was she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) doing? Why was she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
stumbling about amongst the rubble and catching her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) dress in
brambles and burrs? As she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) edged round the keep, she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) must
have got to leeward and smelt his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) cigar-smoke, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
exclaimed, <div class="bookquote">``Hullo! Who's that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Charles made no answer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Saxon or Kelt?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) continued, laughing in the
darkness. <div class="bookquote">``But it doesn't matter. Whichever you are, you
will have to listen to me. I love this place. I love
Shropshire. I hate London. I am glad that this will be my
home. Ah, dear'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) was now moving back towards the
house--<div class="bookquote">``what a comfort to have arrived!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That woman means mischief,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charles/Wilcox/Charles Wilcox</b></font>)</div>thought Charles, and
compressed his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) lips. In a few minutes he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
indoors, as the ground was getting damp. Mists were rising
from the river, and presently it became invisible, though it
whispered more loudly. There had been a heavy downpour in
the Welsh hills.


<p/>Chapter 26

<p/>Next morning a fine mist covered the peninsula. The weather
promised well, and the outline of the castle mound grew
clearer each moment that Margaret watched it. Presently she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
saw the keep, and the sun painted the rubble gold, and
charged the white sky with blue. The shadow of the house
gathered itself together and fell over the garden. A cat
looked up at her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) window and mewed. Lastly the river
appeared, still holding the mists between its banks and its
overhanging alders, and only visible as far as a hill, which
cut off its upper reaches.

<p/>Margaret was fascinated by Oniton. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) had said that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) loved it, but it was rather its romantic tension that
held her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>). The rounded Druids of whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) had caught
glimpses in her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) drive, the rivers hurrying down from them to
England, the carelessly modelled masses of the lower hills,
thrilled her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) with poetry. The house was insignificant, but
the prospect from it would be an eternal joy, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
thought of all the friends she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) would have to stop in it, and
of the conversion of Henry himself to a rural life.
Society, too, promised favourably. The rector of the parish
had dined with them last night, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) found that he (<font color='blue'><b>rector</b></font>) was a
friend of her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) father's, and so knew what to find in her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>).
She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) liked him (<font color='blue'><b>rector</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>rector</b></font>) would introduce her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) to the town. While,
on her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) other side, Sir James Bidder sat, repeating that she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
only had to give the word, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Bidder</b></font>) would whip up the county
families for twenty miles round. Whether Sir James, who was
Garden Seeds, had promised what he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) could perform, she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
doubted, but so long as Henry mistook them for the county
families when they did call, she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) was content.

<p/>Charles and Albert Fussell now crossed the lawn. They
were going for a morning dip, and a servant followed them
with their bathing-dresses. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) had meant to take a stroll
herself before breakfast, but saw that the day was still
sacred to men, and amused herself by watching their
contretemps. In the first place the key of the bathing-shed
could not be found. Charles stood by the riverside with
folded hands, tragical, while the servant shouted, and was
misunderstood by another servant in the garden. Then came a
difficulty about a spring-board, and soon three people were
running backwards and forwards over the meadow, with orders
and counter orders and recriminations and apologies. If
Margaret wanted to jump from a motor-car, she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) jumped; if
Tibby thought paddling would benefit his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) ankles, he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) paddled;
if a clerk desired adventure, he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) took a walk in the dark.
But these athletes seemed paralysed. They could not bathe
without their appliances, though the morning sun was calling
and the last mists were rising from the dimpling stream.
Had they found the life of the body after all? Could not
the men whom they despised as milksops beat them, even on
their own ground?

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>) thought of the bathing arrangements as they should
be in her (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>) day--no worrying of servants, no appliances,
beyond good sense. Her (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>) reflections were disturbed by the
quiet child, who had come out to speak to the cat, but was
now watching her (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>) watch the men. She (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>) called, <div class="bookquote">``Good-morning,
dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>a little sharply. Her (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>) voice spread consternation.
Charles looked round, and though completely attired in
indigo blue, vanished into the shed, and was seen no more.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Wilcox is up--''  (<font color='red'><b>the child</b></font>)</div>the child whispered, and then
became unintelligible.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What's that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>It sounded like, <div class="bookquote">''--cut-yoke--sack back--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't hear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">''--On the bed--tissue-paper--''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Gathering that the wedding-dress was on view, and that a
visit would be seemly, she (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>) went to Evie's room. All was
hilarity here. Evie, in a petticoat, was dancing with one
of the Anglo-Indian ladies, while the other was adoring
yards of white satin. They screamed, they laughed, they
sang, and the dog barked.

<p/>Margaret screamed a little too, but without conviction.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) could not feel that a wedding was so funny. Perhaps
something was missing in her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) equipment.

<p/>Evie gasped: <div class="bookquote">``Dolly is a rotter not to be here! Oh, we
would rag just then!''  (<font color='red'><b>Evie/Evie Wilcox</b></font>)</div>Then Margaret went down to breakfast.

<p/>Henry was already installed; he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) ate slowly and spoke
little, and was, in Margaret's eyes, the only member of
their party who dodged emotion successfully. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) could not
suppose him (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) indifferent either to the loss of his (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) daughter
or to the presence of his (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) future wife. Yet he (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) dwelt intact,
only issuing orders occasionally--orders that promoted the
comfort of his (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) guests. He (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) inquired after her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) hand; he (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) set
her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) to pour out the coffee and Mrs. Warrington to pour out
the tea. When Evie came down there was a moment's
awkwardness, and both ladies rose to vacate their places.
<div class="bookquote">``Burton,''  (<font color='red'><b>Henry</b></font>)</div>called Henry, <div class="bookquote">``serve tea and coffee from the
side-board!''  (<font color='red'><b>Henry</b></font>)</div>It wasn't genuine tact, but it was tact, of a
sort--the sort that is as useful as the genuine, and saves
even more situations at Board meetings. Henry treated a
marriage like a funeral, item by item, never raising his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)
eyes to the whole, and <div class="bookquote">``Death, where is thy sting? Love,
where is thy victory?''  (<font color='red'><b>Henry</b></font>)</div>one would exclaim at the close.

<p/>After breakfast she (<font color='blue'><b>Evie</b></font>) claimed a few words with him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>). It
was always best to approach him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) formally. She (<font color='blue'><b>Evie</b></font>) asked for the
interview, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) was going on to shoot grouse tomorrow,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Evie</b></font>) was returning to Helen in town.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly, dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Of course, I have the
time. What do you want?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I was afraid something had gone wrong.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; I have nothing to say, but you may talk.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Glancing at his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) watch, he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) talked of the nasty curve at
the lych-gate. She (<font color='blue'><b>Evie</b></font>) heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) with interest. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Evie</b></font>) surface
could always respond to his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) without contempt, though all her (<font color='blue'><b>Evie</b></font>)
deeper being might be yearning to help him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Evie</b></font>) had
abandoned any plan of action. Love is the best, and the
more she (<font color='blue'><b>Evie</b></font>) let herself love him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>), the more chance was there
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) would set his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) soul in order. Such a moment as this,
when they sat under fair weather by the walks of their
future home, was so sweet to her (<font color='blue'><b>Evie</b></font>) that its sweetness would
surely pierce to him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>). Each lift of his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) eyes, each parting
of the thatched lip from the clean-shaven, must prelude the
tenderness that kills the Monk and the Beast at a single
blow. Disappointed a hundred times, she (<font color='blue'><b>Evie</b></font>) still hoped. She (<font color='blue'><b>Evie</b></font>)
loved him (<font color='blue'><b>Monk</b></font>) with too clear a vision to fear his (<font color='blue'><b>Monk</b></font>) cloudiness.
Whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Monk</b></font>) droned trivialities, as today, or sprang kisses
on her (<font color='blue'><b>Evie</b></font>) in the twilight, she (<font color='blue'><b>Evie</b></font>) could pardon him (<font color='blue'><b>Monk</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Evie</b></font>) could respond.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If there is this nasty curve,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Evie</b></font>) suggested, <div class="bookquote">``couldn't
we walk to the church? Not, of course, you and Evie; but
the rest of us might very well go on first, and that would
mean fewer carriages.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``One can't have ladies walking through the Market
Square. The Fussells wouldn't like it; they were awfully
particular at Charles's wedding. My--she (<font color='blue'><b>Evie</b></font>)--one of our party
was anxious to walk, and certainly the church was just round
the corner, and I shouldn't have minded; but the Colonel
made a great point of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You men shouldn't be so chivalrous,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>said Margaret thoughtfully.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why not?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) knew why not, but said that she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) did not know.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Monk</b></font>) then announced that, unless she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) had anything special
to say, he (<font color='blue'><b>Monk</b></font>) must visit the wine-cellar, and they went off
together in search of Burton. Though clumsy and a little
inconvenient, Oniton was a genuine country house. They
clattered down flagged passages, looking into room after
room, and scaring unknown maids from the performance of
obscure duties. The wedding-breakfast must be in readiness
when they came back from church, and tea would be served in
the garden. The sight of so many agitated and serious
people made Margaret smile, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) reflected that they were
paid to be serious, and enjoyed being agitated. Here were
the lower wheels of the machine that was tossing Evie up
into nuptial glory. A little boy blocked their way with
pig-tails. His (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) mind could not grasp their greatness, and he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
said: <div class="bookquote">``By your leave; let me pass, please.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Henry asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)
where Burton was. But the servants were so new that they
did not know one another's names. In the still-room sat the
band, who had stipulated for champagne as part of their fee,
and who were already drinking beer. Scents of Araby came
from the kitchen, mingled with cries. Margaret knew what
had happened there, for it happened at Wickham Place. One
of the wedding dishes had boiled over, and the cook was
throwing cedar-shavings to hide the smell. At last they
came upon the butler. Henry gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) the keys, and handed
Margaret down the cellar-stairs. Two doors were unlocked.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>), who kept all her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) wine at the bottom of the
linen-cupboard, was astonished at the sight. <div class="bookquote">``We shall
never get through it!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) cried, and the two men were
suddenly drawn into brotherhood, and exchanged smiles. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
felt as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) had again jumped out of the car while it was moving.

<p/>Certainly Oniton would take some digesting. It would be
no small business to remain herself, and yet to assimilate
such an establishment. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) must remain herself, for his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)
sake as well as her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) own, since a shadowy wife degrades the
husband whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) accompanies; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) must assimilate for
reasons of common honesty, since she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) had no right to marry a
man and make him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) uncomfortable. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) only ally was the power
of Home. The loss of Wickham Place had taught her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) more than
its possession. Howards End had repeated the lesson. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
was determined to create new sanctities among these hills.

<p/>After visiting the wine-cellar, she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) dressed, and then
came the wedding, which seemed a small affair when compared
with the preparations for it. Everything went like one
o'clock. Mr. Cahill materialized out of space, and was
waiting for his (<font color='blue'><b>Cahill</b></font>) bride at the church door. No one dropped
the ring or mispronounced the responses, or trod on Evie's
train, or cried. In a few minutes--the clergymen performed
their duty, the register was signed, and they were back in
their carriages, negotiating the dangerous curve by the
lych-gate. Margaret was convinced that they had not been
married at all, and that the Norman church had been intent
all the time on other business.

<p/>There were more documents to sign at the house, and the
breakfast to eat, and then a few more people dropped in for
the garden party. There had been a great many refusals, and
after all it was not a very big affair--not as big as
Margaret's would be. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) noted the dishes and the strips of
red carpet, that outwardly she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) might give Henry what was
proper. But inwardly she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) hoped for something better than
this blend of Sunday church and fox-hunting. If only
someone had been upset! But this wedding had gone off so
particularly well--<div class="bookquote">``quite like a Durbar''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Edser</b></font>)</div>in the opinion of
Lady Edser, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Edser</b></font>) thoroughly agreed with her (<font color='blue'><b>Edser</b></font>).

<p/>So the wasted day lumbered forward, the bride and
bridegroom drove off, yelling with laughter, and for the
second time the sun retreated towards the hills of Wales.
Henry, who was more tired than he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) owned, came up to her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) in
the castle meadow, and, in tones of unusual softness, said
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) was pleased. Everything had gone off so well. She (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>)
felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) was praising her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>), too, and blushed; certainly
she (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) had done all she (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) could with his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) intractable friends, and
had made a special point of kowtowing to the men. They were
breaking camp this evening: only the Warringtons and quiet
child would stay the night, and the others were already
moving towards the house to finish their packing. <div class="bookquote">``I think
it did go off well,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) agreed. <div class="bookquote">``Since I had to jump out
of the motor, I'm thankful I lighted on my left hand. I am
so very glad about it, Henry dear; I only hope that the
guests at ours may be half as comfortable. You must all
remember that we have no practical person among us, except
my aunt, and she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) is not used to entertainments on a large scale.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) said gravely. <div class="bookquote">``Under the circumstances, it
would be better to put everything into the hands of Harrod's
or Whiteley's, or even to go to some hotel.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You desire a hotel?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, because--well, I mustn't interfere with you. No
doubt you want to be married from your old home.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My old home's falling into pieces, Henry. I only want
my new. Isn't it a perfect evening--''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The Alexandrina isn't bad--''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The Alexandrina,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) echoed, more occupied with the
threads of smoke that were issuing from their chimneys, and
ruling the sunlit slopes with parallels of grey.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's off Curzon Street.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it? Let's be married from off Curzon Street.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) turned westward, to gaze at the swirling gold.
Just where the river rounded the hill the sun caught it.
Fairyland must lie above the bend, and its precious liquid
was pouring towards them past Charles's bathing-shed. She (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>)
gazed so long that her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) eyes were dazzled, and when they
moved back to the house, she (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) could not recognize the faces
of people who were coming out of it. A parlour-maid was
preceding them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who are those people?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They're callers!''  (<font color='red'><b>Henry</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Henry. <div class="bookquote">``It's too late for callers.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps they're town people who want to see the wedding
presents.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm not at home yet to townees.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, hide among the ruins, and if I can stop them, I will.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) thanked her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>).

<p/>Margaret went forward, smiling socially. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) supposed
that these were unpunctual guests, who would have to be
content with vicarious civility, since Evie and Charles were
gone, Henry tired, and the others in their rooms. She (<font color='blue'><b>Evie</b></font>)
assumed the airs of a hostess; not for long. For one of the
group was Helen--Helen in her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) oldest clothes, and dominated
by that tense, wounding excitement that had made her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) a
terror in their nursery days.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is it?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) called. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, what's wrong? Is Tibby ill?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Helen</b></font>)</div><p/>Helen spoke to her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) two companions, who fell back. Then
she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) bore forward furiously.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They're starving!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) shouted. <div class="bookquote">``I found them starving!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who? Why have you come?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The Basts.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Helen!''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>moaned Margaret. <div class="bookquote">``Whatever have you done now?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) has lost his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) place. He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) has been turned out of his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)
bank. Yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)'s done for. We upper classes have ruined
him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), and I suppose you'll tell me it's the battle of life.
Starving. His (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) wife is ill. Starving. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) fainted in the train.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Helen, are you mad?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps. Yes. If you like, I'm mad. But I've brought
them. I'll stand injustice no longer. I'll show up the
wretchedness that lies under this luxury, this talk of
impersonal forces, this cant about God doing what we're too
slack to do ourselves.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you actually brought two starving people from
London to Shropshire, Helen?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Helen</b></font>)</div><p/>Helen was checked. She (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) had not thought of this, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>)
hysteria abated. <div class="bookquote">``There was a restaurant car on the train,''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't be absurd. They aren't starving, and you know
it. Now, begin from the beginning. I won't have such
theatrical nonsense. How dare you! Yes, how dare you!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>)
repeated, as anger filled her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``bursting in to Evie's
wedding in this heartless way. My goodness! but you've a
perverted notion of philanthropy. Look'' (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>--she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) indicated the
house--``servants, people out of the windows. They think
it's some vulgar scandal, and I must explain, <div class="bookquote">``Oh no, it's
only my sister screaming, and only two hangers-on of ours,
whom she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) has brought here for no conceivable reason.'''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Kindly take back that word `hangers-on,'''  (<font color='red'><b>Helen</b></font>)</div>said Helen,
ominously calm.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>conceded Margaret, who for all her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) wrath
was determined to avoid a real quarrel. ``I, too, am sorry
about them, but it beats me why you've brought them here, or
why you're here yourself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's our last chance of seeing Mr. Wilcox.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div><p/>Margaret moved towards the house at this. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) was
determined not to worry Henry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>)'s going to Scotland. I know he (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) is. I insist on
seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, tomorrow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I knew it was our last chance.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How do you do, Mr. Bast?''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>said Margaret, trying to
control her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) voice. <div class="bookquote">``This is an odd business. What view do
you take of it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There is Mrs. Bast, too,''  (<font color='red'><b>Helen</b></font>)</div>prompted Helen.

<p/>Jacky also shook hands. She (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>), like her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) husband, was shy,
and, furthermore, ill, and furthermore, so bestially stupid
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) could not grasp what was happening. She (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) only knew
that the lady had swept down like a whirlwind last night,
had paid the rent, redeemed the furniture, provided them
with a dinner and breakfast, and ordered them to meet her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) at
Paddington next morning. Leonard had feebly protested, and
when the morning came, had suggested that they shouldn't
go. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>), half mesmerized, had obeyed. The lady had
told them to, and they must, and their bed-sitting-room had
accordingly changed into Paddington, and Paddington into a
railway carriage, that shook, and grew hot, and grew cold,
and vanished entirely, and reappeared amid torrents of
expensive scent. <div class="bookquote">``You have fainted,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>said the lady in an
awe-struck voice. <div class="bookquote">``Perhaps the air will do you good.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And
perhaps it had, for here she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was, feeling rather better
among a lot of flowers.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm sure I don't want to intrude,''  (<font color='red'><b>Leonard/Leonard Bast/Bast</b></font>)</div>began Leonard, in
answer to Margaret's question. <div class="bookquote">``But you have been so kind
to me in the past in warning me about the Porphyrion that I
wondered--why, I wondered whether--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Helen</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Whether we could get him (<font color='blue'><b>Bast</b></font>) back into the Porphyrion
again,''  (<font color='red'><b>Helen</b></font>)</div>supplied Helen. <div class="bookquote">``Meg, this has been a cheerful
business. A bright evening's work that was on Chelsea Embankment.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div><p/>Margaret shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) head and returned to Mr. Bast.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't understand. You left the Porphyrion because we
suggested it was a bad concern, didn't you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's right.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And went into a bank instead?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I told you all that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Helen</b></font>)</div>said Helen; <div class="bookquote">``and they reduced
their staff after he (<font color='blue'><b>Bast</b></font>) had been in a month, and now he (<font color='blue'><b>Bast</b></font>)'s
penniless, and I consider that we and our informant are
directly to blame.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Helen</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hate all this,''  (<font color='red'><b>Leonard/Leonard Bast/Bast</b></font>)</div>Leonard muttered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope you do, Mr. Bast. But it's no good mincing
matters. You have done yourself no good by coming here. If
you intend to confront Mr. Wilcox, and to call him (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) to
account for a chance remark, you will make a very great mistake.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I brought them. I did it all,''  (<font color='red'><b>Helen</b></font>)</div>cried Helen.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can only advise you to go at once. My sister has put
you in a false position, and it is kindest to tell you so.
It's too late to get to town, but you'll find a comfortable
hotel in Oniton, where Mrs. Bast can rest, and I hope you'll
be my guests there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That isn't what I want, Miss Schlegel,''  (<font color='red'><b>Leonard/Leonard Bast/Bast</b></font>)</div>said Leonard.
<div class="bookquote">``You're very kind, and no doubt it's a false position, but
you make me miserable. I seem no good at all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's work he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) wants,''  (<font color='red'><b>Helen</b></font>)</div>interpreted Helen. <div class="bookquote">``Can't you see?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) said: <div class="bookquote">``Jacky, let's go. We're more bother than
we're worth. We're costing these ladies pounds and pounds
already to get work for us, and they never will. There's
nothing we're good enough to do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We would like to find you work,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>said Margaret rather
conventionally. <div class="bookquote">``We want to--I, like my sister. You're
only down in your luck. Go to the hotel, have a good
night's rest, and some day you shall pay me back the bill,
if you prefer it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Leonard/Leonard Bast/Bast</b></font>)</div><p/>But Leonard was near the abyss, and at such moments men
see clearly. <div class="bookquote">``You don't know what you're talking about,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>)
said. <div class="bookquote">``I shall never get work now. If rich people fail at
one profession, they can try another. Not I. I had my
groove, and I've got out of it. I could do one particular
branch of insurance in one particular office well enough to
command a salary, but that's all. Poetry's nothing, Miss
Schlegel. One's thoughts about this and that are nothing.
Your money, too, is nothing, if you'll understand me. I
mean if a man over twenty once loses his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own particular job,
it's all over with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). I have seen it happen to others.
Their friends gave them money for a little, but in the end
they fall over the edge. It's no good. It's the whole
world pulling. There always will be rich and poor.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) ceased.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Won't you have something to eat?''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>said Margaret. <div class="bookquote">``I
don't know what to do. It isn't my house, and though Mr.
Wilcox would have been glad to see you at any other time--as
I say, I don't know what to do, but I undertake to do what I
can for you. Helen, offer them something. Do try a
sandwich, Mrs. Bast.''

 (<font color='red'><b>a servant</b></font>)</div><p/>They moved to a long table behind which a servant was
still standing. Iced cakes, sandwiches innumerable, coffee,
claret-cup, champagne, remained almost intact: their overfed
guests could do no more. Leonard refused. Jacky thought
she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) could manage a little. Margaret left them whispering
together and had a few more words with Helen.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) said: <div class="bookquote">``Helen, I like Mr. Bast. I agree that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bast</b></font>)'s
worth helping. I agree that we are directly responsible.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, indirectly. Via Mr. Wilcox.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Let me tell you once for all that if you take up that
attitude, I'll do nothing. No doubt you're right logically,
and are entitled to say a great many scathing things about
Henry. Only, I won't have it. So choose.

<p/>Helen looked at the sunset.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you promise to take them quietly to the George, I
will speak to Henry about them--in my own way, mind; there
is to be none of this absurd screaming about justice. I
have no use for justice. If it was only a question of
money, we could do it ourselves. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) wants work, and
that we can't give him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>), but possibly Henry can.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) duty to,''  (<font color='red'><b>Helen</b></font>)</div>grumbled Helen.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nor am I concerned with duty. I'm concerned with the
characters of various people whom we know, and how, things
being as they are, things may be made a little better. Mr.
Wilcox hates being asked favours: all business men do. But
I am going to ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>), at the risk of a rebuff, because I
want to make things a little better.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well. I promise. You take it very calmly. ''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Take them off to the George, then, and I'll try. Poor
creatures! but they look tried.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>As they parted, she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>)
added: <div class="bookquote">``I haven't nearly done with you, though, Helen. You
have been most self-indulgent. I can't get over it. You
have less restraint rather than more as you grow older.
Think it over and alter yourself, or we shan't have happy lives.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) rejoined Henry. Fortunately he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) had been sitting
down: these physical matters were important. <div class="bookquote">``Was it
townees?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) asked, greeting her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) with a pleasant smile.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You'll never believe me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>said Margaret, sitting down
beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``It's all right now, but it was my sister.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Helen here?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) cried, preparing to rise. <div class="bookquote">``But she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>)
refused the invitation. I thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) despised weddings.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't get up. She (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) has not come to the wedding. I've
bundled her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) off to the George.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Inherently hospitable, he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) protested.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No; she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) has two of her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) proteges with her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>), and must keep
with them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Let 'em all come.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear Henry, did you see them?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``I did catch sight of a brown bunch of a woman, certainly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The brown bunch was Helen, but did you catch sight of a
sea-green and salmon bunch?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What! are they out beanfeasting?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; business. They wanted to see me, and later on I
want to talk to you about them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) was ashamed of her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) own diplomacy. In dealing with a
Wilcox, how tempting it was to lapse from comradeship, and
to give him (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) the kind of woman that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) desired! Henry took
the hint at once, and said: <div class="bookquote">``Why later on? Tell me now. No
time like the present.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Henry</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Shall I?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If it isn't a long story.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, not five minutes; but there's a sting at the end of
it, for I want you to find the man some work in your office.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What are his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) qualifications?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s a clerk.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How old?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Twenty-five, perhaps.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What's his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) name?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Bast,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>said Margaret, and was about to remind him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) that
they had met at Wickham Place, but stopped herself. It had
not been a successful meeting.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where was he (<font color='blue'><b>Bast</b></font>) before?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dempster's Bank.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why did he (<font color='blue'><b>Bast</b></font>) leave?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Place</b></font>) asked, still remembering nothing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They reduced their staff.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``All right; I'll see him (<font color='blue'><b>Bast</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>It was the reward of her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) tact and devotion through the
day. Now she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) understood why some women prefer influence to
rights. Mrs. Plynlimmon, when condemning suffragettes, had
said: <div class="bookquote">``The woman who can't influence her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) husband to vote the
way she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) wants ought to be ashamed of herself.''  (<font color='red'><b>suffragettes</b></font>)</div>Margaret had
winced, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) was influencing Henry now, and though
pleased at her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) little victory, she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) knew that she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) had won it
by the methods of the harem.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I should be glad if you took him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``but I
don't know whether he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)'s qualified.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll do what I can. But, Margaret, this mustn't be
taken as a precedent.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, of course--of course--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't fit in your proteges every day. Business would
suffer.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can promise you he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)'s the last. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)--he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)'s rather a
special case.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Proteges always are.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) let it stand at that. He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) rose with a little extra
touch of complacency, and held out his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) hand to help her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) up.
How wide the gulf between Henry as he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) was and Henry as Helen
thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) ought to be! And she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) herself--hovering as usual
between the two, now accepting men as they are, now yearning
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) sister for Truth. Love and Truth--their warfare
seems eternal. Perhaps the whole visible world rests on it,
and if they were one, life itself, like the spirits when
Prospero was reconciled to his (<font color='blue'><b>Prospero</b></font>) brother, might vanish into
air, into thin air.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your protege has made us late,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Prospero</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``The Fussells
will just be starting.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>On the whole she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) sided with men as they are. Henry
would save the Basts as he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) had saved Howards End, while
Helen and her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) friends were discussing the ethics of
salvation. His (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) was a slap-dash method, but the world has
been built slap-dash, and the beauty of mountain and river
and sunset may be but the varnish with which the unskilled
artificer hides his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) joins. Oniton, like herself, was
imperfect. Its apple-trees were stunted, its castle
ruinous. It, too, had suffered in the border warfare
between the Anglo Saxon and the Kelt, between things as they
are and as they ought to be. Once more the west was
retreating, once again the orderly stars were dotting the
eastern sky. There is certainly no rest for us on the
earth. But there is happiness, and as Margaret descended
the mound on her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) lover's arm, she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) was having
her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) share.

<p/>To her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) annoyance, Mrs. Bast was still in the garden; the
husband and Helen had left her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) there to finish her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) meal
while they went to engage rooms. Margaret found this woman
repellent. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) had felt, when shaking her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) hand, an
overpowering shame. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) remembered the motive of her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) call
at Wickham Place, and smelt again odours from the
abyss--odours the more disturbing because they were
involuntary. For there was no malice in Jacky. There she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
sat, a piece of cake in one hand, an empty champagne glass
in the other, doing no harm to anybody.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)'s overtired,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>Margaret whispered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)'s something else,''  (<font color='red'><b>Henry</b></font>)</div>said Henry. <div class="bookquote">``This won't do. I
can't have her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) in my garden in this state.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)--''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>Margaret hesitated to add <div class="bookquote">``drunk.''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>Now that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) was going to marry him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) had grown particular. He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)
discountenanced risque conversations now.

<p/>Henry went up to the woman. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) raised her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) face, which
gleamed in the twilight like a puff-ball.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Madam, you will be more comfortable at the hotel,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)
said sharply.

<p/>Jacky replied: <div class="bookquote">``If it isn't Hen!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jacky</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ne crois pas que le mari lui ressemble,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>apologized
Margaret. <div class="bookquote">``Il est tout a fait different.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Henry!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) repeated, quite distinctly.

<p/>Mr. Wilcox was much annoyed. <div class="bookquote">``I can't congratulate you
on your proteges,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) remarked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hen, don't go. You do love me, dear, don't you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Bless us, what a person!''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>sighed Margaret, gathering up
her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) skirts.

<p/>Jacky pointed with her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) cake. <div class="bookquote">``You're a nice boy, you
are.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) yawned. <div class="bookquote">``There now, I love you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Henry, I am awfully sorry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And pray why?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) asked, and looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) so sternly
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) feared he (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) was ill. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) seemed more scandalized than
the facts demanded.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``To have brought this down on you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pray don't apologize.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The voice continued.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why does she (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) call you `Hen'?''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>said Margaret
innocently. <div class="bookquote">``Has she (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) ever seen you before?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Seen Hen before!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jacky</b></font>)</div>said Jacky. <div class="bookquote">``Who hasn't seen Hen?
He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)'s serving you like me, my dear. These boys! You
wait--Still we love 'em.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you now satisfied?''  (<font color='red'><b>Henry</b></font>)</div>Henry asked.

<p/>Margaret began to grow frightened. <div class="bookquote">``I don't know what
it is all about,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Let's come in.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) was acting. He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) was
trapped. He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) saw his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) whole life crumbling. <div class="bookquote">``Don't you
indeed?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) said bitingly. <div class="bookquote">``I do. Allow me to congratulate
you on the success of your plan.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``This is Helen's plan, not mine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I now understand your interest in the Basts. Very well
thought out. I am amused at your caution, Margaret. You
are quite right--it was necessary. I am a man, and have
lived a man's past. I have the honour to release you from
your engagement.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Still she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) could not understand. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) knew of life's
seamy side as a theory; she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) could not grasp it as a fact.
More words from Jacky were necessary--words unequivocal, undenied.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So that--''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>burst from her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) went indoors. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
stopped herself from saying more.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So what?''  (<font color='red'><b>Colonel</b></font>)</div>asked Colonel Fussell, who was getting ready
to start in the hall.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We were saying--Henry and I were just having the
fiercest argument, my point being--''  (<font color='red'><b>a footman</b></font>)</div>Seizing his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) fur coat
from a footman, she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) offered to help him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) on. He (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) protested,
and there was a playful little scene.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, let me do that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Henry</b></font>)</div>said Henry, following.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thanks so much! You see--he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) has forgiven me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>The Colonel</b></font>)</div><p/>The Colonel said gallantly: ``I don't expect there's much
to forgive.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) got into the car. The ladies followed him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) after an
interval. Maids, courier, and heavier luggage had been sent
on earlier by the branch--line. Still chattering, still
thanking their host and patronizing their future hostess,
the guests were home away.

<p/>Then Margaret continued: <div class="bookquote">``So that woman has been your mistress?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You put it with your usual delicacy,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) replied.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``When, please?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``When, please?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ten years ago.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) left him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) without a word. For it was not her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
tragedy: it was Mrs. Wilcox's.


<p/>Chapter 27

<p/>Helen began to wonder why she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) had spent a matter of eight
pounds in making some people ill and others angry. Now that
the wave of excitement was ebbing, and had left her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>), Mr.
Bast, and Mrs. Bast stranded for the night in a Shropshire
hotel, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bast</b></font>) asked herself what forces had made the wave
flow. At all events, no harm was done. Margaret would play
the game properly now, and though Helen disapproved of her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>)
sister's methods, she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) knew that the Basts would benefit by
them in the long run.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Wilcox is so illogical,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) explained to Leonard,
who had put his (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) wife to bed, and was sitting with her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) in the
empty coffee-room. <div class="bookquote">``If we told him (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) it was his (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) duty to take
you on, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) might refuse to do it. The fact is, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) isn't
properly educated. I don't want to set you against him (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>), but
you'll find him (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) a trial.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can never thank you sufficiently, Miss Schlegel,''  (<font color='red'><b>Leonard/Leonard Bast/Bast</b></font>)</div>was
all that Leonard felt equal to.

<p/>``I believe in personal responsibility. Don't you? And
in personal everything. I hate--I suppose I oughtn't to say
that--but the Wilcoxes are on the wrong tack surely. Or
perhaps it isn't their fault. Perhaps the little thing that
says ``I' is missing out of the middle of their heads, and
then it's a waste of time to blame them. There's a
nightmare of a theory that says a special race is being born
which will rule the rest of us in the future just because it
lacks the little thing that says <div class="bookquote">``I.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Had you heard that?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I get no time for reading.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Had you thought it, then? That there are two kinds of
people--our kind, who live straight from the middle of their
heads, and the other kind who can't, because their heads
have no middle? They can't say ``I.'' They AREN``T in fact,
and so they're supermen. Pierpont Morgan has never said <div class="bookquote">``I'
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Morgan</b></font>) life.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Pierpont Morgan</b></font>)</div><p/>Leonard roused himself. If his (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) benefactress wanted
intellectual conversation, she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) must have it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) was more
important than his (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) ruined past. <div class="bookquote">``I never got on to
Nietzsche,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``But I always understood that those
supermen were rather what you may call egoists.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, no, that's wrong,''  (<font color='red'><b>Helen</b></font>)</div>replied Helen. ``No superman
ever said ``I want,'' because ``I want' must lead to the
question, <div class="bookquote">``Who am I?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>and so to Pity and to Justice. He (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>)
only says <div class="bookquote">``want.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Want Europe,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>if he (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>)'s Napoleon; `want
wives,<div class="bookquote">'' if he (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>)'s Bluebeard; `want Botticelli,''  (<font color='red'><b>wives</b></font>)</div>if he (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>)'s
Pierpont Morgan. Never the <div class="bookquote">``I'; and if you could pierce
through him (<font color='blue'><b>superman</b></font>), you'd find panic and emptiness in the middle.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Leonard/Leonard Bast/Bast</b></font>)</div><p/>Leonard was silent for a moment. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) said: <div class="bookquote">``May I
take it, Miss Schlegel, that you and I are both the sort
that say `I'?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And your sister too?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course,''  (<font color='red'><b>Helen</b></font>)</div>repeated Helen, a little sharply. She (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) was
annoyed with Margaret, but did not want her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) discussed. <div class="bookquote">``All
presentable people say `I.'''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But Mr. Wilcox--he (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) is not perhaps--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know that it's any good discussing Mr. Wilcox either.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Quite so, quite so,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) agreed. Helen asked herself
why she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) had snubbed him (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>). Once or twice during the day she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>)
had encouraged him (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) to criticize, and then had pulled him (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) up
short. Was she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) afraid of him (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) presuming? If so, it was
disgusting of her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>).

<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) was thinking the snub quite natural. Everything
she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) did was natural, and incapable of causing offence.
While the Miss Schlegels were together he (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) had felt them
scarcely human--a sort of admonitory whirligig. But a Miss
Schlegel alone was different. She (<font color='blue'><b>Schlegel</b></font>) was in Helen's case
unmarried, in Margaret's about to be married, in neither
case an echo of her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) sister. A light had fallen at last into
this rich upper world, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) saw that it was full of men
and women, some of whom were more friendly to him (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) than
others. Helen had become <div class="bookquote">``his (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>)''  (<font color='red'><b>Helen</b></font>)</div>Miss Schlegel, who scolded
him (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) and corresponded with him (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>), and had swept down yesterday
with grateful vehemence. Margaret, though not unkind, was
severe and remote. He (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) would not presume to help her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>), for
instance. He (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) had never liked her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>), and began to think that
his (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) original impression was true, and that her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) sister did
not like her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) either. Helen was certainly lonely. She (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>), who
gave away so much, was receiving too little. Leonard was
pleased to think that he (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) could spare her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) vexation by holding
his (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) tongue and concealing what he (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) knew about Mr. Wilcox.
Jacky had announced her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) discovery when he (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) fetched her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) from
the lawn. After the first shock, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) did not mind for
himself. By now he (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) had no illusions about his (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) wife, and
this was only one new stain on the face of a love that had
never been pure. To keep perfection perfect, that should be
his (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) ideal, if the future gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) time to have ideals.
Helen, and Margaret for Helen's sake, must not know.

<p/>Helen disconcerted him (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) by fuming the conversation to his (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>)
wife. <div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Bast--does she (<font color='blue'><b>Bast</b></font>) ever say `I'?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) asked, half
mischievously, and then, <div class="bookquote">``Is she (<font color='blue'><b>Bast</b></font>) very tired?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's better she (<font color='blue'><b>Bast</b></font>) stops in her (<font color='blue'><b>Bast</b></font>) room,''  (<font color='red'><b>Leonard/Leonard Bast/Bast</b></font>)</div>said Leonard.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Shall I sit up with her (<font color='blue'><b>Bast</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, thank you; she (<font color='blue'><b>Bast</b></font>) does not need company.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Bast, what kind of woman is your wife?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Leonard/Leonard Bast/Bast</b></font>)</div><p/>Leonard blushed up to his (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You ought to know my ways by now. Does that question
offend you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, oh no, Miss Schlegel, no.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because I love honesty. Don't pretend your marriage
has been a happy one. You and she (<font color='blue'><b>Schlegel</b></font>) can have nothing in common.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) did not deny it, but said shyly: <div class="bookquote">``I suppose that's
pretty obvious; but Jacky never meant to do anybody any
harm. When things went wrong, or I heard things, I used to
think it was her (<font color='blue'><b>Schlegel</b></font>) fault, but, looking back, it's more mine.
I needn't have married her (<font color='blue'><b>Schlegel</b></font>), but as I have I must stick to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Schlegel</b></font>) and keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Schlegel</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How long have you been married?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nearly three years.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What did your people say?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They will not have anything to do with us. They had a
sort of family council when they heard I was married, and
cut us off altogether.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Helen</b></font>)</div><p/>Helen began to pace up and down the room. <div class="bookquote">``My good boy,
what a mess!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) said gently. <div class="bookquote">``Who are your people?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) could answer this. His (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) parents, who were dead, had
been in trade; his (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) sisters had married commercial
travellers; his (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) brother was a lay-reader.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And your grandparents?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Leonard/Leonard Bast/Bast</b></font>)</div><p/>Leonard told her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) a secret that he (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) had held shameful up
to now. <div class="bookquote">``They were just nothing at all,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) said,
<div class="bookquote">''--agricultural labourers and that sort.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So! From which part?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Lincolnshire mostly, but my mother's father--he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), oddly
enough, came from these parts round here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``From this very Shropshire. Yes, that is odd. My
mother's people were Lancashire. But why do your brother
and your sisters object to Mrs. Bast?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I don't know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Excuse me, you do know. I am not a baby. I can bear
anything you tell me, and the more you tell the more I shall
be able to help. Have they heard anything against her (<font color='blue'><b>Bast</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) was silent.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think I have guessed now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Helen</b></font>)</div>said Helen very gravely.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think so, Miss Schlegel; I hope not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We must be honest, even over these things. I have
guessed. I am frightfully, dreadfully sorry, but it does
not make the least difference to me. I shall feel just the
same to both of you. I blame, not your wife for these
things, but men.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Leonard/Leonard Bast/Bast</b></font>)</div><p/>Leonard left it at that--so long as she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) did not guess
the man. She (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) stood at the window and slowly pulled up the
blinds. The hotel looked over a dark square. The mists had
begun. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) turned back to him (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) eyes were shining.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't you worry,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) pleaded. <div class="bookquote">``I can't bear that. We
shall be all right if I get work. If I could only get
work--something regular to do. Then it wouldn't be so bad
again. I don't trouble after books as I used. I can
imagine that with regular work we should settle down again.
It stops one thinking. ''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Settle down to what?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, just settle down.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And that's to be life!''  (<font color='red'><b>Helen</b></font>)</div>said Helen, with a catch in her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>)
throat. <div class="bookquote">``How can you, with all the beautiful things to see
and do--with music--with walking at night--''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Walking is well enough when a man's in work,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>)
answered. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, I did talk a lot of nonsense once, but
there's nothing like a bailiff in the house to drive it out
of you. When I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>bailiff</b></font>) fingering my Ruskins and Stevensons,
I seemed to see life straight real, and it isn't a pretty
sight. My books are back again, thanks to you, but they'll
never be the same to me again, and I shan't ever again think
night in the woods is wonderful.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why not?''  (<font color='red'><b>Helen</b></font>)</div>asked Helen, throwing up the window.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Because I see one must have money.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, you're wrong.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish I was wrong, but--the clergyman--he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) has money of
his (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) own, or else he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>)'s paid; the poet or the musician--just
the same; the tramp--he (<font color='blue'><b>tramp</b></font>)'s no different. The tramp goes to
the workhouse in the end, and is paid for with other
people's money. Miss Schlegel, the real thing's money and
all the rest is a dream.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You're still wrong. You've forgotten Death.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Leonard/Leonard Bast/Bast</b></font>)</div><p/>Leonard could not understand.

<p/>``If we lived for ever what you say would be true. But
we have to die, we have to leave life presently. Injustice
and greed would be the real thing if we lived for ever. As
it is, we must hold to other things, because Death is
coming. I love Death--not morbidly, but because He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)
explains. He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) shows me the emptiness of Money. Death and
Money are the eternal foes. Not Death and Life. Never mind
what lies behind Death, Mr. Bast, but be sure that the poet
and the musician and the tramp will be happier in it than
the man who has never learnt to say, <div class="bookquote">``I am I.'''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wonder.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We are all in a mist--I know but I can help you this
far--men like the Wilcoxes are deeper in the mist than any.
Sane, sound Englishmen! building up empires, levelling all
the world into what they call common sense. But mention
Death to them and they're offended, because Death's really
Imperial, and He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cries out against them for ever.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am as afraid of Death as any one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But not of the idea of Death.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But what is the difference?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Infinite difference,''  (<font color='red'><b>Helen</b></font>)</div>said Helen, more gravely than before.

<p/>Leonard looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) wondering, and had the sense of
great things sweeping out of the shrouded night. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>)
could not receive them, because his (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) heart was still full of
little things. As the lost umbrella had spoilt the concert
at Queen's Hall, so the lost situation was obscuring the
diviner harmonies now. Death, Life and Materialism were
fine words, but would Mr. Wilcox take him (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) on as a clerk?
Talk as one would, Mr. Wilcox was king of this world, the
superman, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) own morality, whose head remained in the clouds.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I must be stupid,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) said apologetically.

<p/>While to Helen the paradox became clearer and clearer.
<div class="bookquote">``Death destroys a man: the idea of Death saves him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Behind
the coffins and the skeletons that stay the vulgar mind lies
something so immense that all that is great in us responds
to it. Men of the world may recoil from the charnel-house
that they will one day enter, but Love knows better. Death
is his (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) foe, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) peer, and in their age-long struggle the
thews of Love have been strengthened, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) vision
cleared, until there is no one who can stand against him (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So never give in,''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>continued the girl, and restated
again and again the vague yet convincing plea that the
Invisible lodges against the Visible. Her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) excitement grew
as she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) tried to cut the rope that fastened Leonard to the
earth. Woven of bitter experience, it resisted her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>).
Presently the waitress entered and gave her (<font color='blue'><b>waitress</b></font>) a letter from
Margaret. Another note, addressed to Leonard, was inside.
They read them, listening to the murmurings of the river.


<p/>Chapter 28

<p/>For many hours Margaret did nothing; then she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) controlled
herself, and wrote some letters. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) was too bruised to
speak to Henry; she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) could pity him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>), and even determine to
marry him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>), but as yet all lay too deep in her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) heart for
speech. On the surface the sense of his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) degradation was too
strong. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) could not command voice or look, and the gentle
words that she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) forced out through her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) pen seemed to proceed
from some other person.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dearest boy,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) began, <div class="bookquote">``this is not to part us.
It is everything or nothing, and I mean it to be nothing.
It happened long before we ever met, and even if it had
happened since, I should be writing the same, I hope. I do
understand.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) crossed out <div class="bookquote">``I do understand'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>; it struck a false
note. Henry could not bear to be understood. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) also
crossed out, ``It is everything or nothing. ``Henry would
resent so strong a grasp of the situation. She (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) must not

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think that'll about do,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) thought.

<p/>Then the sense of his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) degradation choked her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>). Was he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)
worth all this bother? To have yielded to a woman of that
sort was everything, yes, it was, and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) could not be his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)
wife. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) tried to translate his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) temptation into her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) own
language, and her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) brain reeled. Men must be different, even
to want to yield to such a temptation. Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) belief in
comradeship was stifled, and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) saw life as from that glass
saloon on the Great Western, which sheltered male and female
alike from the fresh air. Are the sexes really races, each
with its own code of morality, and their mutual love a mere
device of Nature to keep things going? Strip human
intercourse of the proprieties, and is it reduced to this?
Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) judgment told her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) no. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) knew that out of Nature's
device we have built a magic that will win us immortality.
Far more mysterious than the call of sex to sex is the
tenderness that we throw into that call; far wider is the
gulf between us and the farmyard than between the farm-yard
and the garbage that nourishes it. We are evolving, in ways
that Science cannot measure, to ends that Theology dares not
contemplate. <div class="bookquote">``Men did produce one jewel,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>the gods will
say, and, saying, will give us immortality. Margaret knew
all this, but for the moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) could not feel it, and
transformed the marriage of Evie and Mr. Cahill into a
carnival of fools, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Evie</b></font>) own marriage--too miserable to
think of that, she (<font color='blue'><b>Evie</b></font>) tore up the letter, and then wrote
another:


<p/>Dear Mr. Bast,

<p/>I have spoken to Mr. Wilcox about you, as I promised,
and am sorry to say that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) has no vacancy for you.

<p/>Yours truly,
M. J. Schlegel


<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Evie</b></font>) enclosed this in a note to Helen, over which she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>)
took less trouble than she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) might have done; but her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) head was
aching, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) could not stop to pick her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) words:


<p/>Dear Helen,

<p/>Give him (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) this. The Basts are no good. Henry found
the woman drunk on the lawn. I am having a room got
ready for you here, and will you please come round at
once on getting this? The Basts are not at all the type
we should trouble about. I may go round to them myself
in the morning, and do anything that is fair.

<p/>M


<p/>In writing this, Margaret felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) was being
practical. Something might be arranged for the Basts later
on, but they must be silenced for the moment. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) hoped to
avoid a conversation between the woman and Helen. She (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) rang
the bell for a servant, but no one answered it; Mr. Wilcox
and the Warringtons were gone to bed, and the kitchen was
abandoned to Saturnalia. Consequently she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) went over to the
George herself. She (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) did not enter the hotel, for discussion
would have been perilous, and, saying that the letter was
important, she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) gave it to the waitress. As she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) recrossed
the square she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) saw Helen and Mr. Bast looking out of the
window of the coffee-room, and feared she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) was already too
late. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) task was not yet over; she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) ought to tell Henry
what she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) had done.

<p/>This came easily, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) in the hall. The
night wind had been rattling the pictures against the wall,
and the noise had disturbed him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who's there?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) called, quite the householder.

<p/>Margaret walked in and past him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have asked Helen to sleep,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) is best
here; so don't lock the front-door.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought someone had got in,''  (<font color='red'><b>Henry</b></font>)</div>said Henry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``At the same time I told the man that we could do
nothing for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). I don't know about later, but now the
Basts must clearly go.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did you say that your sister is sleeping here, after all?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Probably.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) to be shown up to your room?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have naturally nothing to say to her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>); I am going to
bed. Will you tell the servants about Helen? Could someone
go to carry her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) bag?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) tapped a little gong, which had been bought to summon
the servants.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You must make more noise than that if you want them to hear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Henry</b></font>)</div><p/>Henry opened a door, and down the corridor came shouts
of laughter. <div class="bookquote">``Far too much screaming there,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) said, and
strode towards it. Margaret went upstairs, uncertain
whether to be glad that they had met, or sorry. They had
behaved as if nothing had happened, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) deepest
instincts told her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) that this was wrong. For his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) own sake,
some explanation was due.

<p/>And yet--what could an explanation tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)? A date, a
place, a few details, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) could imagine all too
clearly. Now that the first shock was over, she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) saw that
there was every reason to premise a Mrs. Bast. Henry's
inner life had long laid open to her (<font color='blue'><b>Bast</b></font>)--his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) intellectual
confusion, his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) obtuseness to personal influence, his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) strong
but furtive passions. Should she (<font color='blue'><b>Bast</b></font>) refuse him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) because his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)
outer life corresponded? Perhaps. Perhaps, if the
dishonour had been done to her (<font color='blue'><b>Bast</b></font>), but it was done long before
her (<font color='blue'><b>Bast</b></font>) day. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bast</b></font>) struggled against the feeling. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bast</b></font>) told
herself that Mrs. Wilcox's wrong was her (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) own. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) was
not a bargain theorist. As she (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) undressed, her (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) anger, her (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>)
regard for the dead, her (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) desire for a scene, all grew weak.
Henry must have it as he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) liked, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) loved him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>), and some
day she (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) would use her (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) love to make him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) a better man.

<p/>Pity was at the bottom of her (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) actions all through this
crisis. Pity, if one may generalize, is at the bottom of
woman. When men like us, it is for our better qualities,
and however tender their liking, we dare not be unworthy of
it, or they will quietly let us go. But unworthiness
stimulates woman. It brings out her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) deeper nature, for good
or for evil.

<p/>Here was the core of the question. Henry must be
forgiven, and made better by love; nothing else mattered.
Mrs. Wilcox, that unquiet yet kindly ghost, must be left to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) own wrong. To her (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) everything was in proportion now, and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>), too, would pity the man who was blundering up and down
their lives. Had Mrs. Wilcox known of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) trespass? An
interesting question, but Margaret fell asleep, tethered by
affection, and lulled by the murmurs of the river that
descended all the night from Wales. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) felt herself at one
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) future home, colouring it and coloured by it, and
awoke to see, for the second time, Oniton Castle conquering
the morning mists.


<p/>Chapter 29

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Henry dear--''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>was her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) greeting.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had finished his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) breakfast, and was beginning the
TIMES. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sister-in-law was packing. She (<font color='blue'><b>sister-in-law</b></font>) knelt by him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and
took the paper from him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), feeling that it was unusually heavy
and thick. Then, putting her (<font color='blue'><b>sister-in-law</b></font>) face where it had been, she (<font color='blue'><b>sister-in-law</b></font>)
looked up in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Henry dear, look at me. No, I won't have you
shirking. Look at me. There. That's all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You're referring to last evening,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said huskily. <div class="bookquote">``I
have released you from your engagement. I could find
excuses, but I won't. No, I won't. A thousand times no.
I'm a bad lot, and must be left at that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wilcox/Wilcox</b></font>)</div><p/>Expelled from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) old fortress, Mr. Wilcox was building
a new one. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) could no longer appear respectable to her (<font color='blue'><b>sister-in-law</b></font>), so
he (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) defended himself instead in a lurid past. It was not
true repentance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Leave it where you will, boy. It's not going to
trouble us: I know what I'm talking about, and it will make
no difference.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No difference?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) inquired. <div class="bookquote">``No difference, when you
find that I am not the fellow you thought?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) was annoyed
with Miss Schlegel here. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) would have preferred her (<font color='blue'><b>Schlegel</b></font>) to be
prostrated by the blow, or even to rage. Against the tide
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) sin flowed the feeling that she (<font color='blue'><b>Schlegel</b></font>) was not altogether
womanly. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Schlegel</b></font>) eyes gazed too straight; they had read books
that are suitable for men only. And though he (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) had dreaded a
scene, and though she (<font color='blue'><b>Schlegel</b></font>) had determined against one, there was
a scene, all the same. It was somehow imperative.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am unworthy of you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) began. <div class="bookquote">``Had I been worthy, I
should not have released you from your engagement. I know
what I am talking about. I can't bear to talk of such
things. We had better leave it. ''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Schlegel</b></font>) kissed his (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) hand. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) jerked it from her (<font color='blue'><b>Schlegel</b></font>), and, rising
to his (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) feet, went on: <div class="bookquote">``You, with your sheltered life, and
refined pursuits, and friends, and books, you and your
sister, and women like you--I say, how can you guess the
temptations that lie round a man?''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is difficult for us,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>said Margaret; <div class="bookquote">``but if we are
worth marrying, we do guess.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Cut off from decent society and family ties, what do
you suppose happens to thousands of young fellows overseas?
Isolated. No one near. I know by bitter experience, and
yet you say it makes `no difference.'''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) laughed bitterly. Margaret went to the side-board
and helped herself to one of the breakfast dishes. Being
the last down, she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) turned out the spirit-lamp that kept them
warm. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) was tender, but grave. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) knew that Henry was
not so much confessing his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) soul as pointing out the gulf
between the male soul and the female, and she (<font color='blue'><b>female</b></font>) did not desire
to hear him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) on this point.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Did Helen come?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>female</b></font>) asked.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) head.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But that won't do at all, at all! We don't want her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>)
gossiping with Mrs. Bast.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good God! no!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) exclaimed, suddenly natural. Then
he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) caught himself up. <div class="bookquote">``Let them gossip. My game's up,
though I thank you for your unselfishness--little as my
thanks are worth.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Didn't she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) send me a message or anything?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I heard of none.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Would you ring the bell, please?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What to do?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, to inquire.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) swaggered up to it tragically, and sounded a peal.
Margaret poured herself out some coffee. The butler came,
and said that Miss Schlegel had slept at the George, so far
as he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) had heard. Should he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) go round to the George?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll go, thank you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>said Margaret, and dismissed him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is no good,''  (<font color='red'><b>Henry</b></font>)</div>said Henry. ``Those things leak out;
you cannot stop a story once it has started. I have known
cases of other men--I despised them once, I thought that I``M
different, I shall never be tempted. Oh, Margaret--'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)
came and sat down near her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>), improvising emotion. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) could
not bear to listen to him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>). ``We fellows all come to grief
once in our time. Will you believe that? There are moments
when the strongest man--<div class="bookquote">``Let him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) who standeth, take heed
lest he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fall.''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>That's true, isn't it? If you knew all, you
would excuse me. I was far from good influences--far even
from England. I was very, very lonely, and longed for a
woman's voice. That's enough. I have told you too much
already for you to forgive me now.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, that's enough, dear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) lowered his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) voice--<div class="bookquote">``I have been through hell.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Gravely she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) considered this claim. Had he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)? Had he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)
suffered tortures of remorse, or had it been, <div class="bookquote">``There!
that's over. Now for respectable life again'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>? The latter,
if she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) read him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) rightly. A man who has been through hell
does not boast of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) virility. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is humble and hides it,
if, indeed, it still exists. Only in legend does the sinner
come forth penitent, but terrible, to conquer pure woman by
his (<font color='blue'><b>sinner</b></font>) resistless power. Henry was anxious to be terrible, but
had not got it in him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) was a good average Englishman,
who had slipped. The really culpable point--his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)
faithlessness to Mrs. Wilcox--never seemed to strike him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>).
She (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) longed to mention Mrs. Wilcox.

<p/>And bit by bit the story was told her (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>). It was a very
simple story. Ten years ago was the time, a garrison town
in Cyprus the place. Now and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>)
could possibly forgive him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) answered, <div class="bookquote">``I have
already forgiven you, Henry.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) chose her (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) words carefully,
and so saved him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) from panic. She (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) played the girl, until he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)
could rebuild his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) fortress and hide his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) soul from the
world. When the butler came to clear away, Henry was in a
very different mood--asked the fellow what he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) was in such a
hurry for, complained of the noise last night in the
servants' hall. Margaret looked intently at the butler.
He (<font color='blue'><b>butler</b></font>), as a handsome young man, was faintly attractive to her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
as a woman--an attraction so faint as scarcely to be
perceptible, yet the skies would have fallen if she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) had
mentioned it to Henry.

<p/>On her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) return from the George the building operations
were complete, and the old Henry fronted her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>), competent,
cynical, and kind. He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) had made a clean breast, had been
forgiven, and the great thing now was to forget his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) failure,
and to send it the way of other unsuccessful investments.
Jacky rejoined Howards End and Ducie Street, and the
vermilion motor-car, and the Argentine Hard Dollars, and all
the things and people for whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) had never had much use and
had less now. Their memory hampered him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) could scarcely
attend to Margaret who brought back disquieting news from
the George. Helen and her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) clients had gone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, let them go--the man and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife, I mean, for
the more we see of your sister the better.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But they have gone separately--Helen very early, the
Basts just before I arrived. They have left no message.
They have answered neither of my notes. I don't like to
think what it all means.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What did you say in the notes?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I told you last night.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh--ah--yes! Dear, would you like one turn in the garden?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div><p/>Margaret took his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) arm. The beautiful weather soothed
her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>). But the wheels of Evie's wedding were still at work,
tossing the guests outwards as deftly as they had drawn them
in, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Evie</b></font>) could not be with him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) long. It had been
arranged that they should motor to Shrewsbury, whence he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
would go north, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Evie</b></font>) back to London with the
Warringtons. For a fraction of time she (<font color='blue'><b>Evie</b></font>) was happy. Then
her (<font color='blue'><b>Evie</b></font>) brain recommenced.

<p/>``I am afraid there has been gossiping of some kind at
the George. Helen would not have left unless she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) had heard
something. I mismanaged that. It is wretched. I ought
to--have parted her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) from that woman at once.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Margaret!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) exclaimed, loosing her (<font color='blue'><b>Evie</b></font>) arm impressively.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes--yes, Henry?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am far from a saint--in fact, the reverse--but you
have taken me, for better or worse. Bygones must be
bygones. You have promised to forgive me. Margaret, a
promise is a promise. Never mention that woman again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Except for some practical reason--never.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Practical! You practical!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I'm practical,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Evie</b></font>) murmured, stooping over the
mowing-machine and playing with the grass which trickled
through her (<font color='blue'><b>Evie</b></font>) fingers like sand.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) had silenced her (<font color='blue'><b>Evie</b></font>), but her (<font color='blue'><b>Evie</b></font>) fears made him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) uneasy. Not
for the first time, he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) was threatened with blackmail. He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
was rich and supposed to be moral; the Basts knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
was not, and might find it profitable to hint as much.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``At all events, you mustn't worry,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``This is a
man's business.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) thought intently. <div class="bookquote">``On no account
mention it to anybody.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div><p/>Margaret flushed at advice so elementary, but he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) was
really paving the way for a lie. If necessary he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) would deny
that he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) had ever known Mrs. Bast, and prosecute her (<font color='blue'><b>Bast</b></font>) for
libel. Perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) never had known her (<font color='blue'><b>Bast</b></font>). Here was Margaret,
who behaved as if he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) had not. There the house. Round them
were half a dozen gardeners, clearing up after his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
daughter's wedding. All was so solid and spruce, that the
past flew up out of sight like a spring-blind, leaving only
the last five minutes unrolled.

<p/>Glancing at these, he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) saw that the car would be round
during the next five, and plunged into action. Gongs were
tapped, orders issued, Margaret was sent to dress, and the
housemaid to sweep up the long trickle of grass that she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) had
left across the hall. As is Man to the Universe, so was the
mind of Mr. Wilcox to the minds of some men--a concentrated
light upon a tiny spot, a little Ten Minutes moving
self-contained through its appointed years. No Pagan he (<font color='blue'><b>Pagan</b></font>),
who lives for the Now, and may be wiser than all
philosophers. He (<font color='blue'><b>Pagan</b></font>) lived for the five minutes that have past,
and the five to come; he (<font color='blue'><b>Pagan</b></font>) had the business mind.

<p/>How did he (<font color='blue'><b>Pagan</b></font>) stand now, as his (<font color='blue'><b>Pagan</b></font>) motor slipped out of Oniton
and breasted the great round hills? Margaret had heard a
certain rumour, but was all right. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) had forgiven him (<font color='blue'><b>Pagan</b></font>),
God bless her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) felt the manlier for it. Charles and
Evie had not heard it, and never must hear. No more must
Paul. Over his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) children he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) felt great tenderness, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
did not try to track to a cause: Mrs. Wilcox was too far
back in his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) life. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) did not connect her (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) with the sudden
aching love that he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) felt for Evie. Poor little Evie! he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
trusted that Cahill would make her (<font color='blue'><b>Evie</b></font>) a decent husband.

<p/>And Margaret? How did she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) stand?

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) had several minor worries. Clearly her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) sister had
heard something. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) dreaded meeting her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) in town. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
was anxious about Leonard, for whom they certainly were
responsible. Nor ought Mrs. Bast to starve. But the main
situation had not altered. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bast</b></font>) still loved Henry. His (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)
actions, not his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) disposition, had disappointed her (<font color='blue'><b>Bast</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Bast</b></font>)
could bear that. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Bast</b></font>) loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Bast</b></font>) future home. Standing
up in the car, just where she (<font color='blue'><b>Bast</b></font>) had leapt from it two days
before, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bast</b></font>) gazed back with deep emotion upon Oniton.
Besides the Grange and the Castle keep, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bast</b></font>) could now pick
out the church and the black-and-white gables of the
George. There was the bridge, and the river nibbling its
green peninsula. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bast</b></font>) could even see the bathing-shed, but
while she (<font color='blue'><b>Bast</b></font>) was looking for Charles's new springboard, the
forehead of the hill rose up and hid the whole scene.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Bast</b></font>) never saw it again. Day and night the river flows
down into England, day after day the sun retreats into the
Welsh mountains, and the tower chimes, <div class="bookquote">``See the Conquering
Hero.''  (<font color='red'><b>Welsh</b></font>)</div>But the Wilcoxes have no part in the place, nor in
any place. It is not their names that recur in the parish
register. It is not their ghosts that sigh among the alders
at evening. They have swept into the valley and swept out
of it, leaving a little dust and a little money behind.


<p/>Chapter 30

<p/>Tibby was now approaching his (<font color='blue'><b>Welsh</b></font>) last year at Oxford. He (<font color='blue'><b>Welsh</b></font>) had
moved out of college, and was contemplating the Universe, or
such portions of it as concerned him (<font color='blue'><b>Welsh</b></font>), from his (<font color='blue'><b>Welsh</b></font>) comfortable
lodgings in Long Wall. He (<font color='blue'><b>Welsh</b></font>) was not concerned with much.
When a young man is untroubled by passions and sincerely
indifferent to public opinion, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) outlook is necessarily
limited. Tibby neither wished to strengthen the position of
the rich nor to improve that of the poor, and so was well
content to watch the elms nodding behind the mildly
embattled parapets of Magdalen. There are worse lives.
Though selfish, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was never cruel; though affected in
manner, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) never posed. Like Margaret, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) disdained the
heroic equipment, and it was only after many visits that men
discovered Schlegel to possess a character and a brain. He (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>)
had done well in Mods, much to the surprise of those who
attended lectures and took proper exercise, and was now
glancing disdainfully at Chinese in case he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) should some day
consent to qualify as a Student Interpreter. To him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) thus
employed Helen entered. A telegram had preceded her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>).

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) noticed, in a distant way, that his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) sister had
altered. As a rule he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) found her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) too pronounced, and had
never come across this look of appeal, pathetic yet
dignified--the look of a sailor who has lost everything at sea.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have come from Oniton,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) began. <div class="bookquote">``There has been a
great deal of trouble there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who's for lunch?''  (<font color='red'><b>Tibby</b></font>)</div>said Tibby, picking up the claret,
which was warming in the hearth. Helen sat down
submissively at the table. <div class="bookquote">``Why such an early start?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sunrise or something--when I could get away.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So I surmise. Why?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know what's to be done, Tibby. I am very much
upset at a piece of news that concerns Meg, and do not want
to face her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>), and I am not going back to Wickham Place. I
stopped here to tell you this.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The landlady</b></font>)</div><p/>The landlady came in with the cutlets. Tibby put a
marker in the leaves of his (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>) Chinese Grammar and helped
them. Oxford--the Oxford of the vacation--dreamed and
rustled outside, and indoors the little fire was coated with
grey where the sunshine touched it. Helen continued her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) odd
story.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Give Meg my love and say that I want to be alone. I
mean to go to Munich or else Bonn.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Such a message is easily given,''  (<font color='red'><b>brother</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) brother.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``As regards Wickham Place and my share of the furniture,
you and she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) are to do exactly as you like. My own feeling
is that everything may just as well be sold. What does one
want with dusty economic, books, which have made the world
no better, or with mother's hideous chiffoniers? I have
also another commission for you. I want you to deliver a
letter.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) got up. <div class="bookquote">``I haven't written it yet. Why
shouldn't I post it, though?''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) sat down again. <div class="bookquote">``My head
is rather wretched. I hope that none of your friends are
likely to come in.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tibby</b></font>)</div><p/>Tibby locked the door. His (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) friends often found it in
this condition. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) asked whether anything had gone
wrong at Evie's wedding.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not there,''  (<font color='red'><b>Helen</b></font>)</div>said Helen, and burst into tears.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) had known her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) hysterical--it was one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) aspects
with which he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) had no concern--and yet these tears touched
him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) as something unusual. They were nearer the things that
did concern him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>), such as music. He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) laid down his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) knife and
looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) curiously. Then, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) continued to sob, he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)
went on with his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) lunch.

<p/>The time came for the second course, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) was still
crying. Apple Charlotte was to follow, which spoils by
waiting. <div class="bookquote">``Do you mind Mrs. Martlett coming in?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) asked,
<div class="bookquote">``or shall I take it from her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) at the door?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Could I bathe my eyes, Tibby?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) took her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) bedroom, and introduced the pudding
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) absence. Having helped himself, he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) put it down to
warm in the hearth. His (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) hand stretched towards the Grammar,
and soon he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) was turning over the pages, raising his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) eyebrows
scornfully, perhaps at human nature, perhaps at Chinese. To
him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) thus employed Helen returned. She (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) had pulled herself
together, but the grave appeal had not vanished from her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now for the explanation,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Why didn't I
begin with it? I have found out something about Mr.
Wilcox. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) has behaved very wrongly indeed, and ruined two
people's lives. It all came on me very suddenly last night;
I am very much upset, and I do not know what to do. Mrs. Bast--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Helen</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, those people!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Helen</b></font>)</div><p/>Helen seemed silenced.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Shall I lock the door again?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, thanks, Tibbikins. You're being very good to me.
I want to tell you the story before I go abroad. You must
do exactly what you like--treat it as part of the
furniture. Meg cannot have heard it yet, I think. But I
cannot face her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) and tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) that the man she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) is going to
marry has misconducted himself. I don't even know whether
she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) ought to be told. Knowing as she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) does that I dislike
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) will suspect me, and think that I want to ruin her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>)
match. I simply don't know what to make of such a thing. I
trust your judgment. What would you do?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I gather he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has had a mistress,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tibby</b></font>)</div>said Tibby.

<p/>Helen flushed with shame and anger. <div class="bookquote">``And ruined two
people's lives. And goes about saying that personal actions
count for nothing, and there always will be rich and poor.
He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) met her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was trying to get rich out in Cyprus--I
don't wish to make him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) worse than he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is, and no doubt she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>)
was ready enough to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). But there it is. They met.
He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) goes his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) way and she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) goes hers. What do you suppose is
the end of such women?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) conceded that it was a bad business.

<p/>``They end in two ways: Either they sink till the lunatic
asylums and the workhouses are full of them, and cause Mr.
Wilcox to write letters to the papers complaining of our
national degeneracy, or else they entrap a boy into marriage
before it is too late. She (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>)--I can't blame her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But this isn't all,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) continued after a long pause,
during which the landlady served them with coffee. ``I come
now to the business that took us to Oniton. We went all
three. Acting on Mr. Wilcox's advice, the man throws up a
secure situation and takes an insecure one, from which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is
dismissed. There are certain excuses, but in the main Mr.
Wilcox is to blame, as Meg herself admitted. It is only
common justice that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) should employ the man himself. But
he (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) meets the woman, and, like the cur that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) is, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>)
refuses, and tries to get rid of them. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) makes Meg write.
Two notes came from her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) late that evening--one for me, one
for Leonard, dismissing him (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) with barely a reason. I
couldn't understand. Then it comes out that Mrs. Bast had
spoken to Mr. Wilcox on the lawn while we left her (<font color='blue'><b>Bast</b></font>) to get
rooms, and was still speaking about him (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) when Leonard came
back to her (<font color='blue'><b>Bast</b></font>). This Leonard knew all along. He (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) thought it
natural he (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) should be ruined twice. Natural! Could you have
contained yourself?.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is certainly a very bad business,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tibby</b></font>)</div>said Tibby.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) reply seemed to calm his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) sister. <div class="bookquote">``I was afraid that
I saw it out of proportion. But you are right outside it,
and you must know. In a day or two--or perhaps a week--take
whatever steps you think fit. I leave it in your hands.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) concluded her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) charge.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The facts as they touch Meg are all before you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)
added; and Tibby sighed and felt it rather hard that,
because of his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) open mind, he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) should be empanelled to serve
as a juror. He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) had never been interested in human beings,
for which one must blame him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>), but he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) had had rather too much
of them at Wickham Place. Just as some people cease to
attend when books are mentioned, so Tibby's attention
wandered when <div class="bookquote">``personal relations''  (<font color='red'><b>Tibby</b></font>)</div>came under discussion.
Ought Margaret to know what Helen knew the Basts to know?
Similar questions had vexed him (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) from infancy, and at Oxford
he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) had learned to say that the importance of human beings
has been vastly overrated by specialists. The epigram, with
its faint whiff of the eighties, meant nothing. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>)
might have let it off now if his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) sister had not been
ceaselessly beautiful.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You see, Helen--have a cigarette--I don't see what I'm
to do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then there's nothing to be done. I dare say you are
right. Let them marry. There remains the question of
compensation. ''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you want me to adjudicate that too? Had you not
better consult an expert?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``This part is in confidence,''  (<font color='red'><b>Helen</b></font>)</div>said Helen. <div class="bookquote">``It has
nothing to do with Meg, and do not mention it to her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>). The
compensation--I do not see who is to pay it if I don't, and
I have already decided on the minimum sum. As soon as
possible I am placing it to your account, and when I am in
Germany you will pay it over for me. I shall never forget
your kindness, Tibbikins, if you do this.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What is the sum?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Five thousand.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good God alive!''  (<font color='red'><b>Tibby</b></font>)</div>said Tibby, and went crimson.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, what is the good of driblets? To go through life
having done one thing--to have raised one person from the
abyss: not these puny gifts of shillings and
blankets--making the grey more grey. No doubt people will
think me extraordinary.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't care a damn what people think!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>cried he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>),
heated to unusual manliness of diction. <div class="bookquote">``But it's half what
you have.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not nearly half.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) spread out her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) hands over her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>)
soiled skirt. <div class="bookquote">``I have far too much, and we settled at
Chelsea last spring that three hundred a year is necessary
to set a man on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) feet. What I give will bring in a
hundred and fifty between two. It isn't enough.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) could not recover. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) was not angry or even shocked,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) saw that Helen would still have plenty to live on.
But it amazed him (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) to think what haycocks people can make of
their lives. His (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) delicate intonations would not work, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) could only blurt out that the five thousand pounds would
mean a great deal of bother for him (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) personally.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I didn't expect you to understand me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I? I understand nobody.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you'll do it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Apparently.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I leave you two commissions, then. The first concerns
Mr. Wilcox, and you are to use your discretion. The second
concerns the money, and is to be mentioned to no one, and
carried out literally. You will send a hundred pounds on
account tomorrow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) walked with her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) to the station, passing through those
streets whose serried beauty never bewildered him (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) and never
fatigued. The lovely creature raised domes and spires into
the cloudless blue, and only the ganglion of vulgarity round
Carfax showed how evanescent was the phantom, how faint its
claim to represent England. Helen, rehearsing her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>)
commission, noticed nothing: the Basts were in her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) brain,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) retold the crisis in a meditative way, which might
have made other men curious. She (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) was seeing whether it
would hold. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) once why she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) had taken the Basts
right into the heart of Evie's wedding. She (<font color='blue'><b>Evie</b></font>) stopped like a
frightened animal and said, <div class="bookquote">``Does that seem to you so odd?''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Evie</b></font>) eyes, the hand laid on the mouth, quite haunted him (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>),
until they were absorbed into the figure of St. Mary the
Virgin, before whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) paused for a moment on the walk home.

<p/>It is convenient to follow him (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) in the discharge of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>)
duties. Margaret summoned him (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) the next day. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) was
terrified at Helen's flight, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) had to say that she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) had
called in at Oxford. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) said: <div class="bookquote">``Did she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) seem worried
at any rumour about Henry?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) answered, <div class="bookquote">``Yes.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I knew it
was that!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) exclaimed. <div class="bookquote">``I'll write to her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>Tibby</b></font>)</div>Tibby was relieved.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) then sent the cheque to the address that Helen gave
him (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>), and stated that later on he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) was instructed to forward
five thousand pounds. An answer came back, very civil and
quiet in tone--such an answer as Tibby himself would have
given. The cheque was returned, the legacy refused, the
writer being in no need of money. Tibby forwarded this to
Helen, adding in the fulness of his (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) heart that Leonard Bast
seemed somewhat a monumental person after all. Helen's
reply was frantic. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bast</b></font>) was to take no notice. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bast</b></font>) was to go
down at once and say that she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) commanded acceptance. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bast</b></font>)
went. A scurf of books and china ornaments awaited them.
The Basts had just been evicted for not paying their rent,
and had wandered no one knew whither. Helen had begun
bungling with her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) money by this time, and had even sold out
her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) shares in the Nottingham and Derby Railway. For some
weeks she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) did nothing. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) reinvested, and, owing to
the good advice of her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) stockbrokers, became rather richer
than she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) had been before.


<p/>Chapter 31

<p/>Houses have their own ways of dying, falling as variously as
the generations of men, some with a tragic roar, some
quietly, but to an after-life in the city of ghosts, while
from others--and thus was the death of Wickham Place--the
spirit slips before the body perishes. It had decayed in
the spring, disintegrating the girls more than they knew,
and causing either to accost unfamiliar regions. By
September it was a corpse, void of emotion, and scarcely
hallowed by the memories of thirty years of happiness.
Through its round-topped doorway passed furniture, and
pictures, and books, until the last room was gutted and the
last van had rumbled away. It stood for a week or two
longer, open-eyed, as if astonished at its own emptiness.
Then it fell. Navvies came, and spilt it back into the
grey. With their muscles and their beery good temper, they
were not the worst of undertakers for a house which had
always been human, and had not mistaken culture for an end.

<p/>The furniture, with a few exceptions, went down into
Hertfordshire, Mr. Wilcox having most kindly offered Howards
End as a warehouse. Mr. Bryce had died abroad--an
unsatisfactory affair--and as there seemed little guarantee
that the rent would be paid regularly, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bryce</b></font>) cancelled the
agreement, and resumed possession himself. Until he (<font color='blue'><b>Bryce</b></font>) relet
the house, the Schlegels were welcome to stack their
furniture in the garage and lower rooms. Margaret demurred,
but Tibby accepted the offer gladly; it saved him (<font color='blue'><b>Bryce</b></font>) from
coming to any decision about the future. The plate and the
more valuable pictures found a safer home in London, but the
bulk of the things went country-ways, and were entrusted to
the guardianship of Miss Avery.

<p/>Shortly before the move, our hero and heroine were
married. They have weathered the storm, and may reasonably
expect peace. To have no illusions and yet to love--what
stronger surety can a woman find? She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had seen her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
husband's past as well as his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) heart. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) knew her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) own heart
with a thoroughness that commonplace people believe
impossible. The heart of Mrs. Wilcox was alone hidden, and
perhaps it is superstitious to speculate on the feelings of
the dead. They were married quietly--really quietly, for as
the day approached she (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) refused to go through another
Oniton. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) brother gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) away, her (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) aunt, who was out of
health, presided over a few colourless refreshments. The
Wilcoxes were represented by Charles, who witnessed the
marriage settlement, and by Mr. Cahill. Paul did send a
cablegram. In a few minutes, and without the aid of music,
the clergyman made them man and wife, and soon the glass
shade had fallen that cuts off married couples from the
world. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), a monogamist, regretted the cessation of some
of life's innocent odours; he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>), whose instincts were
polygamous, felt morally braced by the change, and less
liable to the temptations that had assailed him (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) in the past.

<p/>They spent their honeymoon near Innsbruck. Henry knew
of a reliable hotel there, and Margaret hoped for a meeting
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) sister. In this she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) was disappointed. As they
came south, Helen retreated over the Brenner, and wrote an
unsatisfactory postcard from the shores of the Lake of
Garda, saying that her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) plans were uncertain and had better
be ignored. Evidently she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) disliked meeting Henry. Two
months are surely enough to accustom an outsider to a
situation which a wife has accepted in two days, and
Margaret had again to regret her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) sister's lack of
self-control. In a long letter she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) pointed out the need of
charity in sexual matters: so little is known about them; it
is hard enough for those who are personally touched to
judge; then how futile must be the verdict of Society. <div class="bookquote">``I
don't say there is no standard, for that would destroy
morality; only that there can be no standard until our
impulses are classified and better understood.''  (<font color='red'><b>Helen</b></font>)</div>Helen
thanked her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) for her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) kind letter--rather a curious reply.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) moved south again, and spoke of wintering in Naples.

<p/>Mr. Wilcox was not sorry that the meeting failed. Helen
left him (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) time to grow skin over his (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) wound. There were still
moments when it pained him (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>). Had he (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) only known that Margaret
was awaiting him (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>)--Margaret, so lively and intelligent, and
yet so submissive--he (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) would have kept himself worthier of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>). Incapable of grouping the past, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) confused the
episode of Jacky with another episode that had taken place
in the days of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) bachelorhood. The two made one crop of
wild oats, for which he (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) was heartily sorry, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) could not
see that those oats are of a darker stock which are rooted
in another's dishonour. Unchastity and infidelity were as
confused to him (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) as to the Middle Ages, his (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) only moral
teacher. Ruth -LRB-poor old Ruth!-RRB- did not enter into his (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>)
calculations at all, for poor old Ruth had never found him (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) out.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) affection for his (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) present wife grew steadily. Her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
cleverness gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) no trouble, and, indeed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) liked to see
her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) reading poetry or something about social questions; it
distinguished her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) from the wives of other men. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) had only
to call, and she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) clapped the book up and was ready to do
what he (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) wished. Then they would argue so jollily, and once
or twice she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had him (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) in quite a tight corner, but as soon as
he (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) grew really serious, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) gave in. Man is for war, woman
for the recreation of the warrior, but he (<font color='blue'><b>warrior</b></font>) does not dislike
it if she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) makes a show of fight. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) cannot win in a real
battle, having no muscles, only nerves. Nerves make her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
jump out of a moving motor-car, or refuse to be married
fashionably. The warrior may well allow her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) to triumph on
such occasions; they move not the imperishable plinth of
things that touch his (<font color='blue'><b>warrior</b></font>) peace.

<p/>Margaret had a bad attack of these nerves during the
honeymoon. He (<font color='blue'><b>warrior</b></font>) told her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)--casually, as was his (<font color='blue'><b>warrior</b></font>) habit--that
Oniton Grange was let. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) showed her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) annoyance, and asked
rather crossly why she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) had not been consulted.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I didn't want to bother you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>warrior</b></font>) replied. <div class="bookquote">``Besides, I
have only heard for certain this morning.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Where are we to live?''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>said Margaret, trying to laugh.
<div class="bookquote">``I loved the place extraordinarily. Don't you believe in
having a permanent home, Henry?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>warrior</b></font>) assured her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) misunderstood him (<font color='blue'><b>warrior</b></font>). It is home
life that distinguishes us from the foreigner. But he (<font color='blue'><b>foreigner</b></font>) did
not believe in a damp home.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This is news. I never heard till this minute that
Oniton was damp.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear girl!'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--he (<font color='blue'><b>foreigner</b></font>) flung out his (<font color='blue'><b>foreigner</b></font>) hand--<div class="bookquote">``have you eyes?
have you a skin? How could it be anything but damp in such
a situation? In the first place, the Grange is on clay, and
built where the castle moat must have been; then there's
that destestable little river, steaming all night like a
kettle. Feel the cellar walls; look up under the eaves.
Ask Sir James or anyone. Those Shropshire valleys are
notorious. The only possible place for a house in
Shropshire is on a hill; but, for my part, I think the
country is too far from London, and the scenery nothing
special. ''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Margaret could not resist saying, <div class="bookquote">``Why did you go there,
then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I--because--''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>foreigner</b></font>) drew his (<font color='blue'><b>foreigner</b></font>) head back and grew rather
angry. <div class="bookquote">``Why have we come to the Tyrol, if it comes to
that? One might go on asking such questions indefinitely.''

 (<font color='red'><b>One</b></font>)</div><p/>One might; but he (<font color='blue'><b>foreigner</b></font>) was only gaining time for a plausible
answer. Out it came, and he (<font color='blue'><b>foreigner</b></font>) believed it as soon as it was spoken.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The truth is, I took Oniton on account of Evie. Don't
let this go any further.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shouldn't like her (<font color='blue'><b>Evie</b></font>) to know that she (<font color='blue'><b>Evie</b></font>) nearly let me in
for a very bad bargain. No sooner did I sign the agreement
than she (<font color='blue'><b>Evie</b></font>) got engaged. Poor little girl! She (<font color='blue'><b>Evie</b></font>) was so keen on
it all, and wouldn't even wait to make proper inquiries
about the shooting. Afraid it would get snapped up--just
like all of your sex. Well, no harm's done. She (<font color='blue'><b>Evie</b></font>) has had
her (<font color='blue'><b>Evie</b></font>) country wedding, and I've got rid of my house to some
fellows who are starting a preparatory school.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Where shall we live, then, Henry? I should enjoy
living somewhere.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have not yet decided. What about Norfolk?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div><p/>Margaret was silent. Marriage had not saved her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) from
the sense of flux. London was but a foretaste of this
nomadic civilization which is altering human nature so
profoundly, and throws upon personal relations a stress
greater than they have ever borne before. Under
cosmopolitanism, if it comes, we shall receive no help from
the earth. Trees and meadows and mountains will only be a
spectacle, and the binding force that they once exercised on
character must be entrusted to Love alone. May Love be
equal to the task!

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is now what?''  (<font color='red'><b>Henry</b></font>)</div>continued Henry. ``Nearly October.
Let us camp for the winter at Ducie Street, and look out for
something in the spring.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If possible, something permanent. I can't be as young
as I was, for these alterations don't suit me. ''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But, my dear, which would you rather have--alterations
or rheumatism?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I see your point,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>said Margaret, getting up. <div class="bookquote">``If
Oniton is really damp, it is impossible, and must be
inhabited by little boys. Only, in the spring, let us look
before we leap. I will take warning by Evie, and not hurry
you. Remember that you have a free hand this time. These
endless moves must be bad for the furniture, and are
certainly expensive.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What a practical little woman it is! What's it been
reading? Theo--theo--how much?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Theosophy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>So Ducie Street was her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) first fate--a pleasant enough
fate. The house, being only a little larger than Wickham
Place, trained her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) for the immense establishment that was
promised in the spring. They were frequently away, but at
home life ran fairly regularly. In the morning Henry went
to the business, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) sandwich--a relic this of some
prehistoric craving--was always cut by her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) own hand. He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) did
not rely upon the sandwich for lunch, but liked to have it
by him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) in case he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) grew hungry at eleven. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) had gone,
there was the house to look after, and the servants to
humanize, and several kettles of Helen's to keep on the
boil. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) conscience pricked her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) a little about the Basts;
she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) was not sorry to have lost sight of them. No doubt
Leonard was worth helping, but being Henry's wife, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
preferred to help someone else. As for theatres and
discussion societies, they attracted her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) less and less. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
began to <div class="bookquote">``miss''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>new movements, and to spend her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) spare time
re-reading or thinking, rather to the concern of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) Chelsea
friends. They attributed the change to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) marriage, and
perhaps some deep instinct did warn her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) not to travel
further from her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) husband than was inevitable. Yet the main
cause lay deeper still; she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had outgrown stimulants, and was
passing from words to things. It was doubtless a pity not
to keep up with Wedekind or John, but some closing of the
gates is inevitable after thirty, if the mind itself is to
become a creative power.


<p/>Chapter 32

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was looking at plans one day in the following
spring--they had finally decided to go down into Sussex and
build--when Mrs. Charles Wilcox was announced.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you heard the news?''  (<font color='red'><b>Dolly</b></font>)</div>Dolly cried, as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>)
entered the room. <div class="bookquote">``Charles is so ang--I mean he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) is sure you
know about it, or rather, that you don't know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, Dolly!''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>said Margaret, placidly kissing her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``Here's a surprise! How are the boys and the baby?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Boys baby</b></font>)</div><p/>Boys and the baby were well, and in describing a great
row that there had been at Hilton Tennis Club, Dolly forgot
her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) news. The wrong people had tried to get in. The
rector, as representing the older inhabitants, had
said--Charles had said--the tax-collector had said--Charles
had regretted not saying--and she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) closed the description
with, <div class="bookquote">``But lucky you, with four courts of your own at Midhurst.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It will be very jolly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>replied Margaret.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are those the plans? Does it matter me seeing them?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Charles has never seen the plans.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They have only just arrived. Here is the ground
floor--no, that's rather difficult. Try the elevation. We
are to have a good many gables and a picturesque sky-line.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What makes it smell so funny?''  (<font color='red'><b>Dolly</b></font>)</div>said Dolly, after a
moment's inspection. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) was incapable of understanding
plans or maps.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose the paper.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And WHICH way up is it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Just the ordinary way up. That's the sky-line, and the
part that smells strongest is the sky.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, ask me another. Margaret--oh--what was I going
to say? How's Helen?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Quite well.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) never coming back to England? Every one thinks
it's awfully odd she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) doesn't.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So it is,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>said Margaret, trying to conceal her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
vexation. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) was getting rather sore on this point.
``Helen is odd, awfully. She (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) has now been away eight months.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But hasn't she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) any address?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A poste restante somewhere in Bavaria is her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) address.
Do write her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) a line. I will look it up for you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, don't bother. That's eight months she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) has been
away, surely?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Exactly. She (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) left just after Evie's wedding. It would
be eight months.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Just when baby was born, then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Just so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dolly</b></font>)</div><p/>Dolly sighed, and stared enviously round the
drawing-room. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) was beginning to lose her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) brightness and
good looks. The Charles' were not well off, for Mr. Wilcox,
having brought up his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) children with expensive tastes,
believed in letting them shift for themselves. After all,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) had not treated them generously. Yet another baby was
expected, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) told Margaret, and they would have to give up
the motor. Margaret sympathized, but in a formal fashion,
and Dolly little imagined that the step-mother was urging
Mr. Wilcox to make them a more liberal allowance. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
sighed again, and at last the particular grievance was
remembered. <div class="bookquote">``Oh yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) cried, <div class="bookquote">``that is it: Miss Avery
has been unpacking your packing-cases.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why has she (<font color='blue'><b>Avery</b></font>) done that? How unnecessary!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ask another. I suppose you ordered her (<font color='blue'><b>Avery</b></font>) to.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I gave no such orders. Perhaps she (<font color='blue'><b>Avery</b></font>) was airing the
things. She (<font color='blue'><b>Avery</b></font>) did undertake to light an occasional fire.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It was far more than an air,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dolly</b></font>)</div>said Dolly solemnly.
<div class="bookquote">``The floor sounds covered with books. Charles sent me to
know what is to be done, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) feels certain you don't know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Books!''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>cried Margaret, moved by the holy word.
<div class="bookquote">``Dolly, are you serious? Has she (<font color='blue'><b>Avery</b></font>) been touching our books?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hasn't she (<font color='blue'><b>Avery</b></font>), though! What used to be the hall's full of
them. Charles thought for certain you knew of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am very much obliged to you, Dolly. What can have
come over Miss Avery? I must go down about it at once.
Some of the books are my brother's, and are quite valuable.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Avery</b></font>) had no right to open any of the cases.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I say she (<font color='blue'><b>Avery</b></font>)'s dotty. She (<font color='blue'><b>Avery</b></font>) was the one that never got
married, you know. Oh, I say, perhaps she (<font color='blue'><b>Avery</b></font>) thinks your books
are wedding-presents to herself. Old maids are taken that
way sometimes. Miss Avery hates us all like poison ever
since her (<font color='blue'><b>Avery</b></font>) frightful dust-up with Evie.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hadn't heard of that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>said Margaret. A visit from
Dolly had its compensations.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Didn't you know she (<font color='blue'><b>Avery</b></font>) gave Evie a present last August,
and Evie returned it, and then--oh, goloshes! You never
read such a letter as Miss Avery wrote.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But it was wrong of Evie to return it. It wasn't like
her (<font color='blue'><b>Evie</b></font>) to do such a heartless thing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But the present was so expensive.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why does that make any difference, Dolly?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Still, when it costs over five pounds--I didn't see it,
but it was a lovely enamel pendant from a Bond Street shop.
You can't very well accept that kind of thing from a farm
woman. Now, can you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``You accepted a present from Miss Avery when you were married.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, mine was old earthenware stuff--not worth a
halfpenny. Evie's was quite different. You'd have to ask
anyone to the wedding who gave you a pendant like that.
Uncle Percy and Albert and father and Charles all said it
was quite impossible, and when four men agree, what is a
girl to do? Evie didn't want to upset the old thing, so
thought a sort of joking letter best, and returned the
pendant straight to the shop to save Miss Avery trouble.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But Miss Avery said--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dolly</b></font>)</div><p/>Dolly's eyes grew round. ``It was a perfectly awful
letter. Charles said it was the letter of a madman. In the
end she (<font color='blue'><b>Avery</b></font>) had the pendant back again from the shop and threw
it into the duckpond.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Did she (<font color='blue'><b>Avery</b></font>) give any reasons?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We think she (<font color='blue'><b>Avery</b></font>) meant to be invited to Oniton, and so
climb into society.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Avery</b></font>)'s rather old for that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>said Margaret pensively.
<div class="bookquote">``May not she (<font color='blue'><b>Avery</b></font>) have given the present to Evie in remembrance
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Evie</b></font>) mother?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's a notion. Give every one their due, eh? Well,
I suppose I ought to be toddling. Come along, Mr. Muff--you
want a new coat, but I don't know who'll give it you, I'm
sure;''  (<font color='red'><b>Dolly</b></font>)</div>and addressing her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) apparel with mournful humour,
Dolly moved from the room.

<p/>Margaret followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) to ask whether Henry knew about
Miss Avery's rudeness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wonder, then, why he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) let me ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Evie</b></font>) to look after the
house.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But she (<font color='blue'><b>Evie</b></font>)'s only a farm woman,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dolly</b></font>)</div>said Dolly, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>)
explanation proved correct. Henry only censured the lower
classes when it suited him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) bore with Miss Avery as with
Crane--because he (<font color='blue'><b>Crane</b></font>) could get good value out of them. <div class="bookquote">``I have
patience with a man who knows his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) job,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Crane</b></font>) would say, really
having patience with the job, and not the man. Paradoxical
as it may sound, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had something of the artist about him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>);
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would pass over an insult to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) daughter sooner than
lose a good charwoman for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife.

<p/>Margaret judged it better to settle the little trouble
herself. Parties were evidently ruffled. With Henry's
permission, she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) wrote a pleasant note to Miss Avery, asking
her (<font color='blue'><b>Avery</b></font>) to leave the cases untouched. Then, at the first
convenient opportunity, she (<font color='blue'><b>Avery</b></font>) went down herself, intending to
repack her (<font color='blue'><b>Avery</b></font>) belongings and store them properly in the local
warehouse: the plan had been amateurish and a failure.
Tibby promised to accompany her (<font color='blue'><b>Avery</b></font>), but at the last moment
begged to be excused. So, for the second time in her (<font color='blue'><b>Avery</b></font>) life,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Avery</b></font>) entered the house alone.


<p/>Chapter 33

<p/>The day of her (<font color='blue'><b>Avery</b></font>) visit was exquisite, and the last of
unclouded happiness that she (<font color='blue'><b>Avery</b></font>) was to have for many months.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>Avery</b></font>) anxiety about Helen's extraordinary absence was still
dormant, and as for a possible brush with Miss Avery--that
only gave zest to the expedition. She (<font color='blue'><b>Avery</b></font>) had also eluded
Dolly's invitation to luncheon. Walking straight up from
the station, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) crossed the village green and entered the
long chestnut avenue that connects it with the church. The
church itself stood in the village once. But it there
attracted so many worshippers that the devil, in a pet,
snatched it from its foundations, and poised it on an
inconvenient knoll, three-quarters of a mile away. If this
story is true, the chestnut avenue must have been planted by
the angels. No more tempting approach could be imagined for
the luke-warm Christian, and if he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) still finds the walk too
long, the devil is defeated all the same, Science having
built Holy Trinity, a Chapel of Ease, near the Charles', and
roofed it with tin.

<p/>Up the avenue Margaret strolled slowly, stopping to
watch the sky that gleamed through the upper branches of the
chestnuts, or to finger the little horseshoes on the lower
branches. Why has not England a great mythology? Our
folklore has never advanced beyond daintiness, and the
greater melodies about our country-side have all issued
through the pipes of Greece. Deep and true as the native
imagination can be, it seems to have failed here. It has
stopped with the witches and the fairies. It cannot vivify
one fraction of a summer field, or give names to half a
dozen stars. England still waits for the supreme moment of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Our</b></font>) literature--for the great poet who shall voice her (<font color='blue'><b>Our</b></font>), or,
better still, for the thousand little poets whose voices
shall pass into our common talk.

<p/>At the church the scenery changed. The chestnut avenue
opened into a road, smooth but narrow, which led into the
untouched country. She (<font color='blue'><b>Our</b></font>) followed it for over a mile. Its
little hesitations pleased her (<font color='blue'><b>Our</b></font>). Having no urgent destiny,
it strolled downhill or up as it wished, taking no trouble
about the gradients, nor about the view, which nevertheless
expanded. The great estates that throttle the south of
Hertfordshire were less obtrusive here, and the appearance
of the land was neither aristocratic nor suburban. To
define it was difficult, but Margaret knew what it was not:
it was not snobbish. Though its contours were slight, there
was a touch of freedom in their sweep to which Surrey will
never attain, and the distant brow of the Chilterns towered
like a mountain. <div class="bookquote">``Left to itself,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>was Margaret's opinion,
<div class="bookquote">``this county would vote Liberal.''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>The comradeship, not
passionate, that is our highest gift as a nation, was
promised by it, as by the low brick farm where she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) called
for the key.

<p/>But the inside of the farm was disappointing. A most
finished young person received her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Yes, Mrs. Wilcox; no,
Mrs. Wilcox; oh yes, Mrs. Wilcox, auntie received your
letter quite duly. Auntie has gone up to your little place
at the present moment. Shall I send the servant to direct
you?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Followed by: ``Of course, auntie does not generally
look after your place; she (<font color='blue'><b>auntie</b></font>) only does it to oblige a
neighbour as something exceptional. It gives her (<font color='blue'><b>auntie</b></font>) something
to do. She (<font color='blue'><b>auntie</b></font>) spends quite a lot of her (<font color='blue'><b>auntie</b></font>) time there. My
husband says to me sometimes, ``Where's auntie?'' I say, ``Need
you ask? She (<font color='blue'><b>auntie</b></font>)'s at Howards End.<div class="bookquote">'' Yes, Mrs. Wilcox. Mrs.
Wilcox, could I prevail upon you to accept a piece of cake?
Not if I cut it for you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Howards</b></font>)</div><p/>Margaret refused the cake, but unfortunately this
acquired her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) gentility in the eyes of Miss Avery's niece.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I cannot let you go on alone. Now don't. You really
mustn't. I will direct you myself if it comes to that. I
must get my hat. Now'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--roguishly--<div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Wilcox, don't you
move while I'm gone.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div><p/>Stunned, Margaret did not move from the best parlour,
over which the touch of art nouveau had fallen. But the
other rooms looked in keeping, though they conveyed the
peculiar sadness of a rural interior. Here had lived an
elder race, to which we look back with disquietude. The
country which we visit at week-ends was really a home to it,
and the graver sides of life, the deaths, the partings, the
yearnings for love, have their deepest expression in the
heart of the fields. All was not sadness. The sun was
shining without. The thrush sang his (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) two syllables on the
budding guelder-rose. Some children were playing
uproariously in heaps of golden straw. It was the presence
of sadness at all that surprised Margaret, and ended by
giving her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) a feeling of completeness. In these English
farms, if anywhere, one might see life steadily and see it
whole, group in one vision its transitoriness and its
eternal youth, connect--connect without bitterness until all
men are brothers. But her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) thoughts were interrupted by the
return of Miss Avery's niece, and were so tranquillizing
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Avery</b></font>) suffered the interruption gladly.

<p/>It was quicker to go out by the back door, and, after
due explanations, they went out by it. The niece was now
mortified by unnumerable chickens, who rushed up to her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) feet
for food, and by a shameless and maternal sow. She (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) did not
know what animals were coming to. But her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) gentility
withered at the touch of the sweet air. The wind was
rising, scattering the straw and ruffling the tails of the
ducks as they floated in families over Evie's pendant. One
of those delicious gales of spring, in which leaves stiff in
bud seem to rustle, swept over the land and then fell
silent. <div class="bookquote">``Georgia,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>sang the thrush. <div class="bookquote">``Cuckoo,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>came
furtively from the cliff of pine-trees. <div class="bookquote">``Georgia, pretty
Georgia,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>and the other birds joined in with nonsense. The
hedge was a half-painted picture which would be finished in
a few days. Celandines grew on its banks, lords and ladies
and primroses in the defended hollows; the wild rose-bushes,
still bearing their withered hips, showed also the promise
of blossom. Spring had come, clad in no classical garb, yet
fairer than all springs; fairer even than she (<font color='blue'><b>ladies</b></font>) who walks
through the myrtles of Tuscany with the graces before her (<font color='blue'><b>ladies</b></font>)
and the zephyr behind.

<p/>The two women walked up the lane full of outward
civility. But Margaret was thinking how difficult it was to
be earnest about furniture on such a day, and the niece was
thinking about hats. Thus engaged, they reached Howards
End. Petulant cries of <div class="bookquote">``Auntie!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>severed the air. There
was no reply, and the front door was locked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you sure that Miss Avery is up here?''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>asked Margaret.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh yes, Mrs. Wilcox, quite sure. She (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) is here daily.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div><p/>Margaret tried to look in through the dining-room
window, but the curtain inside was drawn tightly. So with
the drawing-room and the hall. The appearance of these
curtains was familiar, yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) did not remember them being
there on her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) other visit: her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) impression was that Mr. Bryce
had taken everything away. They tried the back. Here again
they received no answer, and could see nothing; the
kitchen-window was fitted with a blind, while the pantry and
scullery had pieces of wood propped up against them, which
looked ominously like the lids of packing-cases. Margaret
thought of her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) books, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) lifted up her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) voice also. At
the first cry she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) succeeded.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, well!''  (<font color='red'><b>someone</b></font>)</div>replied someone inside the house. <div class="bookquote">``If it
isn't Mrs. Wilcox come at last!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you got the key, auntie?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Madge, go away,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Avery/Avery</b></font>)</div>said Miss Avery, still invisible.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Auntie, it's Mrs. Wilcox--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div><p/>Margaret supported her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Your niece and I have come together--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Madge, go away. This is no moment for your hat.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The woman</b></font>)</div><p/>The poor woman went red. <div class="bookquote">``Auntie gets more eccentric
lately,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) said nervously.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Avery!''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>called Margaret. <div class="bookquote">``I have come about the
furniture. Could you kindly let me in?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Mrs. Wilcox,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the voice, <div class="bookquote">``of course.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>But
after that came silence. They called again without
response. They walked round the house disconsolately.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope Miss Avery is not ill,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>hazarded Margaret.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, if you'll excuse me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madge</b></font>)</div>said Madge, <div class="bookquote">``perhaps I
ought to be leaving you now. The servants need seeing to at
the farm. Auntie is so odd at times.''  (<font color='red'><b>Madge</b></font>)</div>Gathering up her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
elegancies, she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) retired defeated, and, as if her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) departure
had loosed a spring, the front door opened at once.

<p/>Miss Avery said, <div class="bookquote">``Well, come right in, Mrs. Wilcox!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Avery/Avery</b></font>)</div>quite pleasantly and calmly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you so much,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>began Margaret, but broke off at
the sight of an umbrella-stand. It was her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) own.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come right into the hall first,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Avery</b></font>)</div>said Miss Avery. She (<font color='blue'><b>Avery</b></font>)
drew the curtain, and Margaret uttered a cry of despair.
For an appalling thing had happened. The hall was fitted up
with the contents of the library from Wickham Place. The
carpet had been laid, the big work-table drawn up near the
window; the bookcases filled the wall opposite the
fireplace, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) father's sword--this is what bewildered
her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) particularly--had been drawn from its scabbard and hung
naked amongst the sober volumes. Miss Avery must have
worked for days.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm afraid this isn't what we meant,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Avery</b></font>) began. <div class="bookquote">``Mr.
Wilcox and I never intended the cases to be touched. For
instance, these books are my brother's. We are storing them
for him (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) and for my sister, who is abroad. When you kindly
undertook to look after things, we never expected you to do
so much.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The house has been empty long enough,''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>said the old woman.

<p/>Margaret refused to argue. <div class="bookquote">``I dare say we didn't
explain,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) said civilly. <div class="bookquote">``It has been a mistake, and
very likely our mistake.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Wilcox, it has been mistake upon mistake for fifty
years. The house is Mrs. Wilcox's, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) would not desire
it to stand empty any longer.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div><p/>To help the poor decaying brain, Margaret said:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Mrs. Wilcox's house, the mother of Mr. Charles.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mistake upon mistake,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Avery/Avery</b></font>)</div>said Miss Avery. <div class="bookquote">``Mistake upon mistake.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I don't know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>said Margaret, sitting down in one
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) own chairs. <div class="bookquote">``I really don't know what's to be
done.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) could not help laughing.

<p/>The other said: <div class="bookquote">``Yes, it should be a merry house enough.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know--I dare say. Well, thank you very much,
Miss Avery. Yes, that's all right. Delightful.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There is still the parlour.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) went through the door
opposite and drew a curtain. Light flooded the drawing-room
and the drawing-room furniture from Wickham Place. <div class="bookquote">``And the
dining-room.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>More curtains were drawn, more windows were
flung open to the spring. <div class="bookquote">``Then through here--''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Avery/Avery</b></font>)</div>Miss Avery
continued passing and repassing through the hall. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Avery</b></font>) voice
was lost, but Margaret heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) pulling up the kitchen
blind. <div class="bookquote">``I've not finished here yet,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) announced,
returning. <div class="bookquote">``There's still a deal to do. The farm lads will
carry your great wardrobes upstairs, for there is no need to
go into expense at Hilton.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is all a mistake,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>repeated Margaret, feeling that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) must put her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) foot down. <div class="bookquote">``A misunderstanding. Mr.
Wilcox and I are not going to live at Howards End.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, indeed. On account of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) hay fever?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We have settled to build a new home for ourselves in
Sussex, and part of this furniture--my part--will go down
there presently.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) looked at Miss Avery intently, trying
to understand the kink in her (<font color='blue'><b>Avery</b></font>) brain. Here was no maundering
old woman. Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) wrinkles were shrewd and humorous. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
looked capable of scathing wit and also of high but
unostentatious nobility.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You think that you won't come back to live here, Mrs.
Wilcox, but you will.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That remains to be seen,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>said Margaret, smiling. <div class="bookquote">``We
have no intention of doing so for the present. We happen to
need a much larger house. Circumstances oblige us to give
big parties. Of course, some day--one never knows, does one?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Avery/Avery</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Avery retorted: <div class="bookquote">``Some day! Tcha! tcha! Don't
talk about some day. You are living here now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Avery/Avery</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Am I?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are living here, and have been for the last ten
minutes, if you ask me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>queer</b></font>)</div><p/>It was a senseless remark, but with a queer feeling of
disloyalty Margaret rose from her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) chair. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) felt that
Henry had been obscurely censured. They went into the
dining-room, where the sunlight poured in upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) mother's
chiffonier, and upstairs, where many an old god peeped from
a new niche. The furniture fitted extraordinarily well. In
the central room--over the hall, the room that Helen had
slept in four years ago--Miss Avery had placed Tibby's old
bassinette.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The nursery,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Avery</b></font>) said.

<p/>Margaret turned away without speaking.

<p/>At last everything was seen. The kitchen and lobby were
still stacked with furniture and straw, but, as far as she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
could make out, nothing had been broken or scratched. A
pathetic display of ingenuity! Then they took a friendly
stroll in the garden. It had gone wild since her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) last
visit. The gravel sweep was weedy, and grass had sprung up
at the very jaws of the garage. And Evie's rockery was only
bumps. Perhaps Evie was responsible for Miss Avery's
oddness. But Margaret suspected that the cause lay deeper,
and that the girl's silly letter had but loosed the
irritation of years.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's a beautiful meadow,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) remarked. It was one of
those open-air drawing-rooms that have been formed, hundreds
of years ago, out of the smaller fields. So the boundary
hedge zigzagged down the hill at right angles, and at the
bottom there was a little green annex--a sort of
powder-closet for the cows.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, the maidy's well enough,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Avery/Avery</b></font>)</div>said Miss Avery, <div class="bookquote">``for
those that is, who don't suffer from sneezing.''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Avery/Avery</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Avery</b></font>)
cackled maliciously. <div class="bookquote">``I've seen Charlie Wilcox go out to my
lads in hay time--oh, they ought to do this--they mustn't do
that--he (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>)'d learn them to be lads. And just then the
tickling took him (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) has it from his (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) father, with other
things. There's not one Wilcox that can stand up against a
field in June--I laughed fit to burst while he (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) was courting Ruth.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My brother gets hay fever too,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>said Margaret.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This house lies too much on the land for them.
Naturally, they were glad enough to slip in at first. But
Wilcoxes are better than nothing, as I see you've found.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div><p/>Margaret laughed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They keep a place going, don't they? Yes, it is just that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They keep England going, it is my opinion.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Avery</b></font>)</div><p/>But Miss Avery upset her (<font color='blue'><b>Avery</b></font>) by replying: <div class="bookquote">``Ay, they breed
like rabbits. Well, well, it's a funny world. But He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) who
made it knows what He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) wants in it, I suppose. If Mrs.
Charlie is expecting her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) fourth, it isn't for us to repine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Avery</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They breed and they also work,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>said Margaret,
conscious of some invitation to disloyalty, which was echoed
by the very breeze and by the songs of the birds. <div class="bookquote">``It
certainly is a funny world, but so long as men like my
husband and his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) sons govern it, I think it'll never be a bad
one--never really bad.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, better'n nothing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Avery/Avery</b></font>)</div>said Miss Avery, and turned to
the wych-elm.

<p/>On their way back to the farm she (<font color='blue'><b>Avery</b></font>) spoke of her (<font color='blue'><b>Avery</b></font>) old
friend much more clearly than before. In the house Margaret
had wondered whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) quite distinguished the first wife
from the second. Now she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) said: ``I never saw much of Ruth
after her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruth</b></font>) grandmother died, but we stayed civil. It was a
very civil family. Old Mrs. Howard never spoke against
anybody, nor let anyone be turned away without food. Then
it was never <div class="bookquote">``Trespassers will be prosecuted' in their land,
but would people please not come in. Mrs. Howard was never
created to run a farm.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Had they no men to help them?''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>Margaret asked.

<p/>Miss Avery replied: <div class="bookquote">``Things went on until there were no men.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Avery/Avery</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Until Mr. Wilcox came along,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>corrected Margaret,
anxious that her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) husband should receive his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) dues.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose so; but Ruth should have married a--no
disrespect to you to say this, for I take it you were
intended to get Wilcox any way, whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruth</b></font>) got him (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) first or
no.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Whom should she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruth</b></font>) have married?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A soldier!''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>exclaimed the old woman. <div class="bookquote">``Some real soldier.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div><p/>Margaret was silent. It was a criticism of Henry's
character far more trenchant than any of her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) own. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) felt
dissatisfied.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But that's all over,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) went on. <div class="bookquote">``A better time is
coming now, though you've kept me long enough waiting. In a
couple of weeks I'll see your lights shining through the
hedge of an evening. Have you ordered in coals?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We are not coming,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>said Margaret firmly. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
respected Miss Avery too much to humour her (<font color='blue'><b>Avery</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``No. Not
coming. Never coming. It has all been a mistake. The
furniture must be repacked at once, and I am very sorry but
I am making other arrangements, and must ask you to give me
the keys.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly, Mrs. Wilcox,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Avery/Avery</b></font>)</div>said Miss Avery, and resigned
her (<font color='blue'><b>Avery</b></font>) duties with a smile.

<p/>Relieved at this conclusion, and having sent her (<font color='blue'><b>Avery</b></font>)
compliments to Madge, Margaret walked back to the station.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) had intended to go to the furniture warehouse and give
directions for removal, but the muddle had turned out more
extensive than she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) expected, so she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) decided to consult
Henry. It was as well that she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) did this. He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) was strongly
against employing the local man whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) had previously
recommended, and advised her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) to store in London after all.

<p/>But before this could be done an unexpected trouble fell
upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>).


<p/>Chapter 34

<p/>It was not unexpected entirely. Aunt Juley's health had
been bad all the winter. She (<font color='blue'><b>Juley</b></font>) had had a long series of colds
and coughs, and had been too busy to get rid of them. She (<font color='blue'><b>Juley</b></font>)
had scarcely promised her (<font color='blue'><b>Juley</b></font>) niece <div class="bookquote">``to really take my tiresome
chest in hand,''  (<font color='red'><b>niece</b></font>)</div>when she (<font color='blue'><b>Juley</b></font>) caught a chill and developed acute
pneumonia. Margaret and Tibby went down to Swanage. Helen
was telegraphed for, and that spring party that after all
gathered in that hospitable house had all the pathos of fair
memories. On a perfect day, when the sky seemed blue
porcelain, and the waves of the discreet little bay beat
gentlest of tattoos upon the sand, Margaret hurried up
through the rhododendrons, confronted again by the
senselessness of Death. One death may explain itself, but
it throws no light upon another: the groping inquiry must
begin anew. Preachers or scientists may generalize, but we
know that no generality is possible about those whom we
love; not one heaven awaits them, not even one oblivion.
Aunt Juley, incapable of tragedy, slipped out of life with
odd little laughs and apologies for having stopped in it so
long. She (<font color='blue'><b>Juley</b></font>) was very weak; she (<font color='blue'><b>Juley</b></font>) could not rise to the
occasion, or realize the great mystery which all agree must
await her (<font color='blue'><b>Juley</b></font>); it only seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Juley</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Juley</b></font>) was quite done
up--more done up than ever before; that she (<font color='blue'><b>Juley</b></font>) saw and heard
and felt less every moment; and that, unless something
changed, she (<font color='blue'><b>Juley</b></font>) would soon feel nothing. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Juley</b></font>) spare strength
she (<font color='blue'><b>Juley</b></font>) devoted to plans: could not Margaret take some steamer
expeditions? were mackerel cooked as Tibby liked them? She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
worried herself about Helen's absence, and also that she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
could be the cause of Helen's return. The nurses seemed to
think such interests quite natural, and perhaps hers was an
average approach to the Great Gate. But Margaret saw Death
stripped of any false romance; whatever the idea of Death
may contain, the process can be trivial and hideous.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Important--Margaret dear, take the Lulworth when Helen comes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Helen won't be able to stop, Aunt Juley. She (<font color='blue'><b>Juley</b></font>) has
telegraphed that she (<font color='blue'><b>Juley</b></font>) can only get away just to see you. She (<font color='blue'><b>Juley</b></font>)
must go back to Germany as soon as you are well.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How very odd of Helen! Mr. Wilcox--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, dear?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Can he (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) spare you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Henry</b></font>)</div><p/>Henry wished her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) to come, and had been very kind. Yet
again Margaret said so.

<p/>Mrs. Munt did not die. Quite outside her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) will, a more
dignified power took hold of her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) and checked her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) on the
downward slope. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) returned, without emotion, as fidgety
as ever. On the fourth day she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) was out of danger.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Margaret--important,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>it went on: <div class="bookquote">``I should like you to
have some companion to take walks with. Do try Miss Conder.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have been a little walk with Miss Conder.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But she (<font color='blue'><b>Conder</b></font>) is not really interesting. If only you had Helen.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have Tibby, Aunt Juley.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, but he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) has to do his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) Chinese. Some real companion
is what you need. Really, Helen is odd.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Helen is odd, very,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>agreed Margaret.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not content with going abroad, why does she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) want to go
back there at once?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No doubt she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) will change her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) mind when she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) sees us.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) has not the least balance.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Helen</b></font>)</div><p/>That was the stock criticism about Helen, but Margaret's
voice trembled as she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) made it. By now she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) was deeply pained
at her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) sister's behaviour. It may be unbalanced to fly out
of England, but to stop away eight months argues that the
heart is awry as well as the head. A sick-bed could recall
Helen, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) was deaf to more human calls; after a glimpse
at her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) aunt, she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) would retire into her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) nebulous life behind
some poste restante. She (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) scarcely existed; her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) letters had
become dull and infrequent; she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) had no wants and no
curiosity. And it was all put down to poor Henry's
account! Henry, long pardoned by his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) wife, was still too
infamous to be greeted by his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) sister-in-law. It was morbid,
and, to her (<font color='blue'><b>sister-in-law</b></font>) alarm, Margaret fancied that she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) could trace the
growth of morbidity back in Helen's life for nearly four
years. The flight from Oniton; the unbalanced patronage of
the Basts; the explosion of grief up on the Downs--all
connected with Paul, an insignificant boy whose lips had
kissed hers for a fraction of time. Margaret and Mrs.
Wilcox had feared that they might kiss again. Foolishly:
the real danger was reaction. Reaction against the Wilcoxes
had eaten into her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) life until she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) was scarcely sane. At
twenty-five she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) had an idee fixe. What hope was there for
her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) as an old woman?

<p/>The more Margaret thought about it the more alarmed she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
became. For many months she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) had put the subject away, but
it was too big to be slighted now. There was almost a taint
of madness. Were all Helen's actions to be governed by a
tiny mishap, such as may happen to any young man or woman?
Can human nature be constructed on lines so insignificant?
The blundering little encounter at Howards End was vital.
It propagated itself where graver intercourse lay barren; it
was stronger than sisterly intimacy, stronger than reason or
books. In one of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) moods Helen had confessed that she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>)
still <div class="bookquote">``enjoyed''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>it in a certain sense. Paul had faded, but
the magic of his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) caress endured. And where there is
enjoyment of the past there may also be
reaction--propagation at both ends.

<p/>Well, it is odd and sad that our minds should be such
seed-beds, and we without power to choose the seed. But man
is an odd, sad creature as yet, intent on pilfering the
earth, and heedless of the growths within himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
cannot be bored about psychology. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) leaves it to the
specialist, which is as if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) should leave his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) dinner to be
eaten by a steam-engine. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cannot be bothered to digest
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own soul. Margaret and Helen have been more patient,
and it is suggested that Margaret has succeeded--so far as
success is yet possible. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) does understand herself, she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
has some rudimentary control over her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) own growth. Whether
Helen has succeeded one cannot say.

<p/>The day that Mrs. Munt rallied Helen's letter arrived.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) had posted it at Munich, and would be in London herself
on the morrow. It was a disquieting letter, though the
opening was affectionate and sane.


<p/>Dearest Meg,

<p/>Give Helen's love to Aunt Juley. Tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) that I
love, and have loved, her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) ever since I can remember. I
shall be in London Thursday.

<p/>My address will be care of the bankers. I have not
yet settled on a hotel, so write or wire to me there and
give me detailed news. If Aunt Juley is much better, or
if, for a terrible reason, it would be no good my coming
down to Swanage, you must not think it odd if I do not
come. I have all sorts of plans in my head. I am living
abroad at present, and want to get back as quickly as
possible. Will you please tell me where our furniture
is. I should like to take out one or two books; the rest
are for you.

<p/>Forgive me, dearest Meg. This must read like rather
a tiresome letter, but all letters are from your loving

<p/>Helen


<p/>It was a tiresome letter, for it tempted Margaret to
tell a lie. If she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) wrote that Aunt Juley was still in
danger her (<font color='blue'><b>Juley</b></font>) sister would come. Unhealthiness is contagious.
We cannot be in contact with those who are in a morbid state
without ourselves deteriorating. To <div class="bookquote">``act for the best''
 (<font color='red'><b>Helen</b></font>)</div>might do Helen good, but would do herself harm, and, at the
risk of disaster, she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) colours flying a little
longer. She (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) replied that their aunt was much better, and
awaited developments.

<p/>Tibby approved of her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) reply. Mellowing rapidly, he (<font color='blue'><b>We</b></font>) was
a pleasanter companion than before. Oxford had done much
for him (<font color='blue'><b>We</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>We</b></font>) had lost his (<font color='blue'><b>We</b></font>) peevishness, and could hide his (<font color='blue'><b>We</b></font>)
indifference to people and his (<font color='blue'><b>We</b></font>) interest in food. But he (<font color='blue'><b>We</b></font>) had
not grown more human. The years between eighteen and
twenty-two, so magical for most, were leading him (<font color='blue'><b>We</b></font>) gently
from boyhood to middle age. He (<font color='blue'><b>We</b></font>) had never known
young-manliness, that quality which warms the heart till
death, and gives Mr. Wilcox an imperishable charm. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) was
frigid, through no fault of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) own, and without cruelty.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) thought Helen wrong and Margaret right, but the family
trouble was for him (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) what a scene behind footlights is for
most people. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) had only one suggestion to make, and that
was characteristic.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why don't you tell Mr. Wilcox?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``About Helen?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) has come across that sort of thing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) would do all he (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) could, but--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, you know best. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) is practical.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the student</b></font>)</div><p/>It was the student's belief in experts. Margaret
demurred for one or two reasons. Presently Helen's answer
came. She (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) sent a telegram requesting the address of the
furniture, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) would now return at once. Margaret
replied, <div class="bookquote">``Certainly not; meet me at the bankers at four.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) and Tibby went up to London. Helen was not at the
bankers, and they were refused her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) address. Helen had
passed into chaos.

<p/>Margaret put her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) arm round her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) brother. He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) was all that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) had left, and never had he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) seemed more unsubstantial.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tibby love, what next?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) replied: <div class="bookquote">``It is extraordinary.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear, your judgment's often clearer than mine. Have
you any notion what's at the back?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``None, unless it's something mental.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh--that!''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>said Margaret. <div class="bookquote">``Quite impossible.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>But the
suggestion had been uttered, and in a few minutes she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) took
it up herself. Nothing else explained. And London agreed
with Tibby. The mask fell off the city, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) saw it for
what it really is--a caricature of infinity. The familiar
barriers, the streets along which she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) moved, the houses
between which she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) had made her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) little journeys for so many
years, became negligible suddenly. Helen seemed one with
grimy trees and the traffic and the slowly-flowing slabs of
mud. She (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) had accomplished a hideous act of renunciation and
returned to the One. Margaret's own faith held firm. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
knew the human soul will be merged, if it be merged at all,
with the stars and the sea. Yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) felt that her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) sister
had been going amiss for many years. It was symbolic the
catastrophe should come now, on a London afternoon, while
rain fell slowly.

<p/>Henry was the only hope. Henry was definite. He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) might
know of some paths in the chaos that were hidden from them,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) determined to take Tibby's advice and lay the whole
matter in his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) hands. They must call at his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) office. He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)
could not well make it worse. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) went for a few moments
into St. Paul's, whose dome stands out of the welter so
bravely, as if preaching the gospel of form. But within,
St. Paul's is as its surroundings--echoes and whispers,
inaudible songs, invisible mosaics, wet footmarks crossing
and recrossing the floor. Si monumentum requiris,
circumspice: it points us back to London. There was no hope
of Helen here.

<p/>Henry was unsatisfactory at first. That she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) had
expected. He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) was overjoyed to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) back from Swanage,
and slow to admit the growth of a new trouble. When they
told him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) of their search, he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) only chaffed Tibby and the
Schlegels generally, and declared that it was <div class="bookquote">``just like
Helen''  (<font color='red'><b>Tibby</b></font>)</div>to lead her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) relatives a dance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That is what we all say,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>replied Margaret. <div class="bookquote">``But why
should it be just like Helen? Why should she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) be allowed to
be so queer, and to grow queerer?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't ask me. I'm a plain man of business. I live and
let live. My advice to you both is, don't worry. Margaret,
you've got black marks again under your eyes. You know
that's strictly forbidden. First your aunt--then your
sister. No, we aren't going to have it. Are we,
Theobald?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) rang the bell. <div class="bookquote">``I'll give you some tea, and
then you go straight to Ducie Street. I can't have my girl
looking as old as her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) husband.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``All the same, you have not quite seen our point,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tibby</b></font>)</div>said Tibby.

<p/>Mr. Wilcox, who was in good spirits, retorted, <div class="bookquote">``I don't
suppose I ever shall.''  (<font color='red'><b>spirits</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) leant back, laughing at the
gifted but ridiculous family, while the fire flickered over
the map of Africa. Margaret motioned to her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) brother to go
on. Rather diffident, he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) obeyed her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Margaret's point is this,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Our sister may be
mad.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charles/Wilcox/Charles Wilcox</b></font>)</div><p/>Charles, who was working in the inner room, looked round.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come in, Charles,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>said Margaret kindly. <div class="bookquote">``Could you
help us at all? We are again in trouble.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm afraid I cannot. What are the facts? We are all
mad more or less, you know, in these days.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The facts are as follows,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tibby</b></font>)</div>replied Tibby, who had at
times a pedantic lucidity. <div class="bookquote">``The facts are that she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) has been
in England for three days and will not see us. She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) has
forbidden the bankers to give us her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) address. She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) refuses
to answer questions. Margaret finds her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) letters
colourless. There are other facts, but these are the most
striking.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) has never behaved like this before, then?''  (<font color='red'><b>Henry</b></font>)</div>asked Henry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course not!''  (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) wife, with a frown.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, my dear, how am I to know?''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>A senseless spasm of annoyance came over her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``You know
quite well that Helen never sins against affection,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
said. <div class="bookquote">``You must have noticed that much in her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>), surely.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh yes; she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) and I have always hit it off together.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, Henry--can't you see? --I don't mean that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) recovered herself, but not before Charles had
observed her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>). Stupid and attentive, he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) was watching the scene.

<p/>``I was meaning that when she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) was eccentric in the past,
one could trace it back to the heart in the long run. She (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>)
behaved oddly because she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) cared for someone, or wanted to
help them. There's no possible excuse for her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) now. She (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) is
grieving us deeply, and that is why I am sure that she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) is
not well. <div class="bookquote">``Mad' is too terrible a word, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) is not
well. I shall never believe it. I shouldn't discuss my
sister with you if I thought she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) was well--trouble you about
her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>), I mean.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Henry</b></font>)</div><p/>Henry began to grow serious. Ill-health was to him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)
something perfectly definite. Generally well himself, he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)
could not realize that we sink to it by slow gradations.
The sick had no rights; they were outside the pale; one
could lie to them remorselessly. When his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) first wife was
seized, he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) had promised to take her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) down into Hertfordshire,
but meanwhile arranged with a nursing-home instead. Helen,
too, was ill. And the plan that he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) sketched out for her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>)
capture, clever and well-meaning as it was, drew its ethics
from the wolf-pack.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You want to get hold of her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``That's the
problem, isn't it? She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) has got to see a doctor.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``For all I know she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) has seen one already.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, yes; don't interrupt.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) rose to his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) feet and
thought intently. The genial, tentative host disappeared,
and they saw instead the man who had carved money out of
Greece and Africa, and bought forests from the natives for a
few bottles of gin. <div class="bookquote">``I've got it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said at last. <div class="bookquote">``It's
perfectly easy. Leave it to me. We'll send her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) down to
Howards End.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How will you do that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``After her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) books. Tell her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) must unpack them
herself. Then you can meet her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But, Henry, that's just what she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) won't let me do. It's
part of her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)--whatever it is--never to see me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course you won't tell her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) you're going. When she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) is
there, looking at the cases, you'll just stroll in. If
nothing is wrong with her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>), so much the better. But there'll
be the motor round the corner, and we can run her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) up to a
specialist in no time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div><p/>Margaret shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``It's quite impossible.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It doesn't seem impossible to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tibby</b></font>)</div>said Tibby; <div class="bookquote">``it is
surely a very tippy plan.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tibby</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is impossible, because--''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) husband
sadly. <div class="bookquote">``It's not the particular language that Helen and I
talk if you see my meaning. It would do splendidly for
other people, whom I don't blame.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But Helen doesn't talk,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tibby</b></font>)</div>said Tibby. <div class="bookquote">``That's our whole
difficulty. She (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) won't talk your particular language, and on
that account you think she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>)'s ill.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, Henry; it's sweet of you, but I couldn't.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I see,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``you have scruples.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And sooner than go against them you would have your
sister suffer. You could have got her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) down to Swanage by a
word, but you had scruples. And scruples are all very
well. I am as scrupulous as any man alive, I hope; but when
it is a case like this, when there is a question of madness--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I deny it's madness.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You said just now--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Henry</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's madness when I say it, but not when you say it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Henry</b></font>)</div><p/>Henry shrugged his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) shoulders. <div class="bookquote">``Margaret! Margaret!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)
groaned. <div class="bookquote">``No education can teach a woman logic. Now, my
dear, my time is valuable. Do you want me to help you or not?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not in that way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Answer my question. Plain question, plain answer. Do--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charles/Wilcox/Charles Wilcox</b></font>)</div><p/>Charles surprised them by interrupting. <div class="bookquote">``Pater, we may
as well keep Howards End out of it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, Charles?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charles/Wilcox/Charles Wilcox</b></font>)</div><p/>Charles could give no reason; but Margaret felt as if,
over tremendous distance, a salutation had passed between them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The whole house is at sixes and sevens,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) said
crossly. <div class="bookquote">``We don't want any more mess.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who's `we'?''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>asked his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) father. <div class="bookquote">``My boy, pray, who's `we'?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sure I beg your pardon,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charles/Wilcox/Charles Wilcox</b></font>)</div>said Charles. <div class="bookquote">``I appear
always to be intruding.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div><p/>By now Margaret wished she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) had never mentioned her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
trouble to her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) husband. Retreat was impossible. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) was
determined to push the matter to a satisfactory conclusion,
and Helen faded as he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) talked. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) fair, flying hair and
eager eyes counted for nothing, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) was ill, without
rights, and any of her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) friends might hunt her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>). Sick at
heart, Margaret joined in the chase. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) wrote her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) sister a
lying letter, at her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) husband's dictation; she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) said the
furniture was all at Howards End, but could be seen on
Monday next at 3 p.m., when a charwoman would be in
attendance. It was a cold letter, and the more plausible
for that. Helen would think she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) was offended. And on
Monday next she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) and Henry were to lunch with Dolly, and then
ambush themselves in the garden.

<p/>After they had gone, Mr. Wilcox said to his (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) son: <div class="bookquote">``I
can't have this sort of behaviour, my boy. Margaret's too
sweet-natured to mind, but I mind for her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>son</b></font>)</div><p/>Charles made no answer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is anything wrong with you, Charles, this afternoon?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, pater; but you may be taking on a bigger business
than you reckon.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't ask me.''


 (<font color='red'><b>children</b></font>)</div><p/>Chapter 35

<p/>One speaks of the moods of spring, but the days that are her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>)
true children have only one mood; they are all full of the
rising and dropping of winds, and the whistling of birds.
New flowers may come out, the green embroidery of the hedges
increase, but the same heaven broods overhead, soft, thick,
and blue, the same figures, seen and unseen, are wandering
by coppice and meadow. The morning that Margaret had spent
with Miss Avery, and the afternoon she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) set out to entrap
Helen, were the scales of a single balance. Time might
never have moved, rain never have fallen, and man alone,
with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) schemes and ailments, was troubling Nature until he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) through a veil of tears.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) protested no more. Whether Henry was right or
wrong, he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) was most kind, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) knew of no other standard
by which to judge him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) must trust him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) absolutely. As
soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) had taken up a business, his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) obtuseness
vanished. He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) profited by the slightest indications, and the
capture of Helen promised to be staged as deftly as the
marriage of Evie.

<p/>They went down in the morning as arranged, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)
discovered that their victim was actually in Hilton. On his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)
arrival he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) called at all the livery-stables in the village,
and had a few minutes' serious conversation with the
proprietors. What he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) said, Margaret did not know--perhaps
not the truth; but news arrived after lunch that a lady had
come by the London train, and had taken a fly to Howards End.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) was bound to drive,''  (<font color='red'><b>Henry</b></font>)</div>said Henry. ``There will be
her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) books.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I cannot make it out,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>said Margaret for the hundredth time.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Finish your coffee, dear. We must be off.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Margaret, you know you must take plenty,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dolly</b></font>)</div>said Dolly.

<p/>Margaret tried, but suddenly lifted her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) hand to her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
eyes. Dolly stole glances at her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) father-in-law which he (<font color='blue'><b>father-in-law</b></font>) did
not answer. In the silence the motor came round to the door.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You're not fit for it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>father-in-law</b></font>) said anxiously. <div class="bookquote">``Let me go
alone. I know exactly what to do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh yes, I am fit,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>said Margaret, uncovering her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) face.
<div class="bookquote">``Only most frightfully worried. I cannot feel that Helen is
really alive. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) letters and telegrams seem to have come
from someone else. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) voice isn't in them. I don't
believe your driver really saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) at the station. I wish
I'd never mentioned it. I know that Charles is vexed. Yes,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) is--''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) seized Dolly's hand and kissed it. <div class="bookquote">``There,
Dolly will forgive me. There. Now we'll be off.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Henry</b></font>)</div><p/>Henry had been looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) closely. He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) did not like
this breakdown.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't you want to tidy yourself?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have I time?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, plenty.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) went to the lavatory by the front door, and as soon
as the bolt slipped, Mr. Wilcox said quietly:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dolly, I'm going without her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wilcox/Wilcox</b></font>)</div><p/>Dolly's eyes lit up with vulgar excitement. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>)
followed him (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) on tip-toe out to the car.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) I thought it best.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Mr. Wilcox, I see.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Say anything you like. All right.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The car started well, and with ordinary luck would have
got away. But Porgly-woggles, who was playing in the
garden, chose this moment to sit down in the middle of the
path. Crane, in trying to pass him (<font color='blue'><b>Crane</b></font>), ran one wheel over a
bed of wallflowers. Dolly screamed. Margaret, hearing the
noise, rushed out hatless, and was in time to jump on the
footboard. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) said not a single word: he (<font color='blue'><b>Crane</b></font>) was only treating
her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) had treated Helen, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) rage at his (<font color='blue'><b>Crane</b></font>) dishonesty
only helped to indicate what Helen would feel against them.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) thought, <div class="bookquote">``I deserve it: I am punished for lowering my
colours.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) accepted his (<font color='blue'><b>Crane</b></font>) apologies with a calmness
that astonished him (<font color='blue'><b>Crane</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I still consider you are not fit for it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Crane</b></font>) kept saying.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps I was not at lunch. But the whole thing is
spread clearly before me now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I was meaning to act for the best.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Just lend me your scarf, will you? This wind takes
one's hair so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly, dear girl. Are you all right now?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Look! My hands have stopped trembling.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And have quite forgiven me? Then listen. Her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) cab
should already have arrived at Howards End. -LRB-We're a little
late, but no matter.-RRB- Our first move will be to send it down
to wait at the farm, as, if possible, one doesn't want a
scene before servants. A certain gentleman'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--he (<font color='blue'><b>Crane</b></font>) pointed at
Crane's back--<div class="bookquote">``won't drive in, but will wait a little short
of the front gate, behind the laurels. Have you still the
keys of the house?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Crane</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, they aren't wanted. Do you remember how the
house stands?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If we don't find her (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) in the porch, we can stroll round
into the garden. Our object--''

 (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div><p/>Here they stopped to pick up the doctor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I was just saying to my wife, Mansbridge, that our main
object is not to frighten Miss Schlegel. The house, as you
know, is my property, so it should seem quite natural for us
to be there. The trouble is evidently nervous--wouldn't you
say so, Margaret?''

 (<font color='red'><b>The doctor man</b></font>)</div><p/>The doctor, a very young man, began to ask questions
about Helen. Was she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) normal? Was there anything congenital
or hereditary? Had anything occurred that was likely to
alienate her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) from her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) family?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>answered Margaret, wondering what would have
happened if she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) had added: <div class="bookquote">``Though she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) did resent my
husband's immorality.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) always was highly strung,''  (<font color='red'><b>Henry</b></font>)</div>pursued Henry, leaning
back in the car as it shot past the church. <div class="bookquote">``A tendency to
spiritualism and those things, though nothing serious.
Musical, literary, artistic, but I should say normal--a very
charming girl.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div><p/>Margaret's anger and terror increased every moment. How
dare these men label her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) sister! What horrors lay ahead!
What impertinences that shelter under the name of science!
The pack was turning on Helen, to deny her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) human rights, and
it seemed to Margaret that all Schlegels were threatened
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Were they normal?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>What a question to ask! And
it is always those who know nothing about human nature, who
are bored by psychology and shocked by physiology, who ask
it. However piteous her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) sister's state, she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) knew that she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
must be on her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) side. They would be mad together if the
world chose to consider them so.

<p/>It was now five minutes past three. The car slowed down
by the farm, in the yard of which Miss Avery was standing.
Henry asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Avery</b></font>) whether a cab had gone past. She (<font color='blue'><b>Avery</b></font>) nodded,
and the next moment they caught sight of it, at the end of
the lane. The car ran silently like a beast of prey. So
unsuspicious was Helen that she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) was sitting on the porch,
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) back to the road. She (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) had come. Only her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) head and
shoulders were visible. She (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) sat framed in the vine, and one
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) hands played with the buds. The wind ruffled her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>)
hair, the sun glorified it; she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) was as she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) had always been.

<p/>Margaret was seated next to the door. Before her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
husband could prevent her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) slipped out. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) ran to the
garden gate, which was shut, passed through it, and
deliberately pushed it in his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) face. The noise alarmed
Helen. Margaret saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) rise with an unfamiliar movement,
and, rushing into the porch, learnt the simple explanation
of all their fears--her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) sister was with child.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is the truant all right?''  (<font color='red'><b>Henry</b></font>)</div>called Henry.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) had time to whisper: <div class="bookquote">``Oh, my darling--''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>The keys of
the house were in her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) hand. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) unlocked Howards End and
thrust Helen into it. <div class="bookquote">``Yes, all right,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) said, and stood
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) back to the door.


<p/>Chapter 36

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Margaret, you look upset!''  (<font color='red'><b>Henry</b></font>)</div>said Henry. Mansbridge had
followed. Crane was at the gate, and the flyman had stood
up on the box. Margaret shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) head at them; she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) could
not speak any more. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) remained clutching the keys, as if
all their future depended on them. Henry was asking more
questions. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) head again. His (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) words had no
sense. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) wonder why she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) had let Helen in. <div class="bookquote">``You
might have given me a knock with the gate,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was another of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) remarks. Presently she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) heard herself speaking. She (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>), or
someone for her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>), said <div class="bookquote">``Go away.''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>Henry came nearer. He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)
repeated, <div class="bookquote">``Margaret, you look upset again. My dear, give me
the keys. What are you doing with Helen?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, dearest, do go away, and I will manage it all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Manage what?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) stretched out his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) hand for the keys. She (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) might have
obeyed if it had not been for the doctor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Stop that at least,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) said piteously; the doctor had
turned back, and was questioning the driver of Helen's cab.
A new feeling came over her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) was fighting for women
against men. She (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) did not care about rights, but if men came
into Howards End, it should be over her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) body.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, this is an odd beginning,''  (<font color='red'><b>husband</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) husband.

<p/>The doctor came forward now, and whispered two words to
Mr. Wilcox--the scandal was out. Sincerely horrified, Henry
stood gazing at the earth.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I cannot help it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>said Margaret. <div class="bookquote">``Do wait. It's not
my fault. Please all four of you to go away now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Crane</b></font>)</div><p/>Now the flyman was whispering to Crane.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We are relying on you to help us, Mrs. Wilcox,''  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>said
the young doctor. <div class="bookquote">``Could you go in and persuade your sister
to come out?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``On what grounds?''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>said Margaret, suddenly looking him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>)
straight in the eyes.

<p/>Thinking it professional to prevaricate, he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) murmured
something about a nervous breakdown.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I beg your pardon, but it is nothing of the sort. You
are not qualified to attend my sister, Mr. Mansbridge. If
we require your services, we will let you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can diagnose the case more bluntly if you wish,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) retorted.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You could, but you have not. You are, therefore, not
qualified to attend my sister.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, come, Margaret!''  (<font color='red'><b>Henry</b></font>)</div>said Henry, never raising his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)
eyes. <div class="bookquote">``This is a terrible business, an appalling business.
It's doctor's orders. Open the door.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Forgive me, but I will not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't agree.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div><p/>Margaret was silent.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This business is as broad as it's long,''  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>contributed
the doctor. <div class="bookquote">``We had better all work together. You need us,
Mrs. Wilcox, and we need you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Quite so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Henry</b></font>)</div>said Henry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not need you in the least,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>said Margaret.

<p/>The two men looked at each other anxiously.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No more does my sister, who is still many weeks from
her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) confinement.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Margaret, Margaret!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, Henry, send your doctor away. What possible use
is he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) now?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wilcox/Wilcox</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Wilcox ran his (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) eye over the house. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) had a vague
feeling that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) must stand firm and support the doctor. He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>)
himself might need support, for there was trouble ahead.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It all turns on affection now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>said Margaret.
<div class="bookquote">``Affection. Don't you see?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Resuming her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) usual methods,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) wrote the word on the house with her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) finger. <div class="bookquote">``Surely
you see. I like Helen very much, you not so much. Mr.
Mansbridge doesn't know her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>). That's all. And affection,
when reciprocated, gives rights. Put that down in your
notebook, Mr. Mansbridge. It's a useful formula.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Henry</b></font>)</div><p/>Henry told her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) to be calm.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't know what you want yourselves,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>said
Margaret, folding her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) arms. <div class="bookquote">``For one sensible remark I will
let you in. But you cannot make it. You would trouble my
sister for no reason. I will not permit it. I'll stand
here all the day sooner.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mansbridge,''  (<font color='red'><b>Henry</b></font>)</div>said Henry in a low voice, <div class="bookquote">``perhaps not now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Henry</b></font>)</div><p/>The pack was breaking up. At a sign from his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) master,
Crane also went back into the car.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, Henry, you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) said gently. None of her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
bitterness had been directed at him (<font color='blue'><b>Crane</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Go away now, dear. I
shall want your advice later, no doubt. Forgive me if I
have been cross. But, seriously, you must go.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Crane</b></font>) was too stupid to leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>). Now it was Mr.
Mansbridge who called in a low voice to him (<font color='blue'><b>Mansbridge</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall soon find you down at Dolly's,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) called, as
the gate at last clanged between them. The fly moved out of
the way, the motor backed, turned a little, backed again,
and turned in the narrow road. A string of farm carts came
up in the middle; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) waited through all, for there was
no hurry. When all was over and the car had started, she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
opened the door. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, my darling!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``My darling,
forgive me.''  (<font color='red'><b>Helen</b></font>)</div>Helen was standing in the hall.


<p/>Chapter 37

<p/>Margaret bolted the door on the inside. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) would have
kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) sister, but Helen, in a dignified voice, that
came strangely from her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>), said:

<p/>``Convenient! You did not tell me that the books were
unpacked. I have found nearly everything that I want.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I told you nothing that was true.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It has been a great surprise, certainly. Has Aunt
Juley been ill?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Helen, you wouldn't think I'd invent that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose not,''  (<font color='red'><b>Helen</b></font>)</div>said Helen, turning away, and crying a
very little. <div class="bookquote">``But one loses faith in everything after this.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We thought it was illness, but even then--I haven't
behaved worthily.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Helen</b></font>)</div><p/>Helen selected another book.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I ought not to have consulted anyone. What would our
father have thought of me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) did not think of questioning her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) sister, nor of
rebuking her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>). Both might be necessary in the future, but
she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) had first to purge a greater crime than any that Helen
could have committed--that want of confidence that is the
work of the devil.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I am annoyed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Helen</b></font>)</div>replied Helen. <div class="bookquote">``My wishes should
have been respected. I would have gone through this meeting
if it was necessary, but after Aunt Juley recovered, it was
not necessary. Planning my life, as I now have to do--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Come away from those books,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>called Margaret. <div class="bookquote">``Helen,
do talk to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I was just saying that I have stopped living
haphazard. One can't go through a great deal of'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>)
missed out the noun--<div class="bookquote">``without planning one's actions in
advance. I am going to have a child in June, and in the
first place conversations, discussions, excitement, are not
good for me. I will go through them if necessary, but only
then. In the second place I have no right to trouble
people. I cannot fit in with England as I know it. I have
done something that the English never pardon. It would not
be right for them to pardon it. So I must live where I am
not known.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But why didn't you tell me, dearest?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Helen</b></font>)</div>replied Helen judicially. <div class="bookquote">``I might have, but
decided to wait.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">'' I believe you would never have told me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh yes, I should. We have taken a flat in Munich.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div><p/>Margaret glanced out of window.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``By `we' I mean myself and Monica. But for her (<font color='blue'><b>Monica</b></font>), I am
and have been and always wish to be alone.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have not heard of Monica.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You wouldn't have. She (<font color='blue'><b>Monica</b></font>)'s an Italian--by birth at
least. She (<font color='blue'><b>Monica</b></font>) makes her (<font color='blue'><b>Monica</b></font>) living by journalism. I met her (<font color='blue'><b>Monica</b></font>)
originally on Garda. Monica is much the best person to see
me through.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are very fond of her (<font color='blue'><b>Monica</b></font>), then.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Monica</b></font>) has been extraordinarily sensible with me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div><p/>Margaret guessed at Monica's type--<div class="bookquote">``Italiano Inglesiato''
 (<font color='red'><b>Monica</b></font>)</div>they had named it: the crude feminist of the South, whom one
respects but avoids. And Helen had turned to it in her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>)
need!

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You must not think that we shall never meet,''  (<font color='red'><b>Helen</b></font>)</div>said
Helen, with a measured kindness. <div class="bookquote">``I shall always have a
room for you when you can be spared, and the longer you can
be with me the better. But you haven't understood yet, Meg,
and of course it is very difficult for you. This is a shock
to you. It isn't to me, who have been thinking over our
futures for many months, and they won't be changed by a
slight contretemps, such as this. I cannot live in England.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Helen, you've not forgiven me for my treachery. You
COULDN<div class="bookquote">``T talk like this to me if you had.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Meg dear, why do we talk at all?''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) dropped a
book and sighed wearily. Then, recovering herself, she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>)
said: <div class="bookquote">``Tell me, how is it that all the books are down here?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Series of mistakes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And a great deal of the furniture has been unpacked.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``All.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who lives here, then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose you are letting it though--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The house is dead,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>said Margaret with a frown. <div class="bookquote">``Why
worry on about it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I am interested. You talk as if I had lost all my
interest in life. I am still Helen, I hope. Now this
hasn't the feel of a dead house. The hall seems more alive
even than in the old days, when it held the Wilcoxes' own things.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Interested, are you? Very well, I must tell you, I
suppose. My husband lent it on condition we--but by a
mistake all our things were unpacked, and Miss Avery,
instead of--''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) stopped. <div class="bookquote">``Look here, I can't go on like
this. I warn you I won't. Helen, why should you be so
miserably unkind to me, simply because you hate Henry?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't hate him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Helen</b></font>)</div>said Helen. <div class="bookquote">``I have stopped
being a schoolgirl, and, Meg, once again, I'm not being
unkind. But as for fitting in with your English life--no,
put it out of your head at once. Imagine a visit from me at
Ducie Street! It's unthinkable.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div><p/>Margaret could not contradict her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>). It was appalling to
see her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) quietly moving forward with her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) plans, not bitter or
excitable, neither asserting innocence nor confessing guilt,
merely desiring freedom and the company of those who would
not blame her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) had been through--how much? Margaret
did not know. But it was enough to part her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) from old habits
as well as old friends.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell me about yourself,''  (<font color='red'><b>Helen</b></font>)</div>said Helen, who had chosen her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>)
books, and was lingering over the furniture.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There's nothing to tell.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But your marriage has been happy, Meg?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, but I don't feel inclined to talk.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You feel as I do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not that, but I can't.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No more can I. It is a nuisance, but no good trying.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Something had come between them. Perhaps it was
Society, which henceforward would exclude Helen. Perhaps it
was a third life, already potent as a spirit. They could
find no meeting-place. Both suffered acutely, and were not
comforted by the knowledge that affection survived.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Look here, Meg, is the coast clear?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You mean that you want to go away from me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose so--dear old lady! it isn't any use. I knew
we should have nothing to say. Give my love to Aunt Juley
and Tibby, and take more yourself than I can say. Promise
to come and see me in Munich later.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly, dearest.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``For that is all we can do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>It seemed so. Most ghastly of all was Helen's common
sense: Monica had been extraordinarily good for her (<font color='blue'><b>Monica</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am glad to have seen you and the things.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Monica</b></font>) looked
at the bookcase lovingly, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Monica</b></font>) was saying farewell to
the past.

<p/>Margaret unbolted the door. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) remarked: <div class="bookquote">``The car has
gone, and here's your cab.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) led the way to it, glancing at the leaves and the
sky. The spring had never seemed more beautiful. The
driver, who was leaning on the gate, called out, <div class="bookquote">``Please,
lady, a message,''  (<font color='red'><b>The driver</b></font>)</div>and handed her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) Henry's visiting-card
through the bars.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How did this come?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) asked.

<p/>Crane had returned with it almost at once.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) read the card with annoyance. It was covered with
instructions in domestic French. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) sister
had talked she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) was to come back for the night to Dolly's.
<div class="bookquote">``Il faut dormir sur ce sujet.''  (<font color='red'><b>Helen</b></font>)</div>While Helen was to be found
<div class="bookquote">``une comfortable chambre a l'hotel.''  (<font color='red'><b>Helen</b></font>)</div>The final sentence
displeased her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) greatly until she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) remembered that the
Charles' had only one spare room, and so could not invite a
third guest.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Henry would have done what he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) could,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) interpreted.

<p/>Helen had not followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) into the garden. The door
once open, she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) lost her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) inclination to fly. She (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) remained in
the hall, going from bookcase to table. She (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) grew more like
the old Helen, irresponsible and charming.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This is Mr. Wilcox's house?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) inquired.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Surely you remember Howards End?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Remember? I who remember everything! But it looks to
be ours now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Avery was extraordinary,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>said Margaret, her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) own
spirits lightening a little. Again she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) was invaded by a
slight feeling of disloyalty. But it brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) relief,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) yielded to it. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Avery</b></font>) loved Mrs. Wilcox, and would
rather furnish her (<font color='blue'><b>Avery</b></font>) house with our things than think of it
empty. In consequence here are all the library books. ''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not all the books. She (<font color='blue'><b>Avery</b></font>) hasn't unpacked the Art Books,
in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Avery</b></font>) may show her (<font color='blue'><b>Avery</b></font>) sense. And we never used to have
the sword here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The sword looks well, though.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Magnificent.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, doesn't it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Where's the piano, Meg?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I warehoused that in London. Why?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Curious, too, that the carpet fits.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The carpet's a mistake,''  (<font color='red'><b>Helen</b></font>)</div>announced Helen. <div class="bookquote">``I know that
we had it in London, but this floor ought to be bare. It is
far too beautiful.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``You still have a mania for under-furnishing. Would you
care to come into the dining-room before you start? There's
no carpet there.

<p/>They went in, and each minute their talk became more natural.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, WHAT a place for mother's chiffonier!''  (<font color='red'><b>Helen</b></font>)</div>cried Helen.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Look at the chairs, though.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, look at them! Wickham Place faced north, didn't it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``North-west.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Anyhow, it is thirty years since any of those chairs
have felt the sun. Feel. Their little backs are quite warm.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But why has Miss Avery made them set to partners? I
shall just--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Over here, Meg. Put it so that any one sitting will
see the lawn.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div><p/>Margaret moved a chair. Helen sat down in it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ye-es. The window's too high.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Try a drawing-room chair.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I don't like the drawing-room so much. The beam
has been match-boarded. It would have been so beautiful
otherwise. ''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Helen, what a memory you have for some things! You're
perfectly right. It's a room that men have spoilt through
trying to make it nice for women. Men don't know what we
want--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And never will.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't agree. In two thousand years they'll know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But the chairs show up wonderfully. Look where Tibby
spilt the soup.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Coffee. It was coffee surely.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Helen</b></font>)</div><p/>Helen shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``Impossible. Tibby was far too
young to be given coffee at that time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Was Father alive?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Then you're right and it must have been soup. I was
thinking of much later--that unsuccessful visit of Aunt
Juley's, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Juley</b></font>) didn't realize that Tibby had grown up.
It was coffee then, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) threw it down on purpose. There
was some rhyme, ``Tea, coffee--coffee, tea,<div class="bookquote">'' that she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) said to
him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) every morning at breakfast. Wait a minute--how did it go?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know--no, I don't. What a detestable boy Tibby was!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But the rhyme was simply awful. No decent person could
have put up with it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, that greengage tree,''  (<font color='red'><b>Helen</b></font>)</div>cried Helen, as if the garden
was also part of their childhood. <div class="bookquote">``Why do I connect it with
dumbbells? And there come the chickens. The grass wants
cutting. I love yellow-hammers--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div><p/>Margaret interrupted her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I have got it,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
announced.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tea, tea, coffee, tea,<BR>
Or chocolaritee.''


 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That every morning for three weeks. No wonder Tibby
was wild.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Tibby is moderately a dear now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Helen</b></font>)</div>said Helen.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There! I knew you'd say that in the end. Of course
he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)'s a dear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>A bell rang.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Listen! what's that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Helen</b></font>)</div><p/>Helen said, <div class="bookquote">``Perhaps the Wilcoxes are beginning the siege.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Helen</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What nonsense--listen!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>And the triviality faded from their faces, though it
left something behind--the knowledge that they never could
be parted because their love was rooted in common things.
Explanations and appeals had failed; they had tried for a
common meeting-ground, and had only made each other
unhappy. And all the time their salvation was lying round
them--the past sanctifying the present; the present, with
wild heart-throb, declaring that there would after all be a
future, with laughter and the voices of children. Helen,
still smiling, came up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) sister. She (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``It is
always Meg.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>They looked into each other's eyes. The inner
life had paid.

<p/>Solemnly the clapper tolled. No one was in the front.
Margaret went to the kitchen, and struggled between
packing-cases to the window. Their visitor was only a
little boy with a tin can. And triviality returned.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Little boy, what do you want?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Please, I am the milk.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did Miss Avery send you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>said Margaret, rather sharply.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, please.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then take it back and say we require no milk.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>While
she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) called to Helen, <div class="bookquote">``No, it's not the siege, but possibly
an attempt to provision us against one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Helen</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I like milk,''  (<font color='red'><b>Helen</b></font>)</div>cried Helen. <div class="bookquote">``Why send it away?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you? Oh, very well. But we've nothing to put it
in, and he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) wants the can.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Please, I'm to call in the morning for the can,''  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div>said
the boy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The house will be locked up then.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In the morning would I bring eggs, too?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you the boy whom I saw playing in the stacks last week?''

 (<font color='red'><b>The child</b></font>)</div><p/>The child hung his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) head.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, run away and do it again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nice little boy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Helen</b></font>)</div>whispered Helen. <div class="bookquote">``I say, what's your
name? Mine's Helen.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Tom.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Helen</b></font>)</div><p/>That was Helen all over. The Wilcoxes, too, would ask a
child its name, but they never told their names in return.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tom, this one here is Margaret. And at home we've
another called Tibby.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mine are lop-eared,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom</b></font>)</div>replied Tom, supposing Tibby to be
a rabbit.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You're a very good and rather a clever little boy.
Mind you come again.--Isn't he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) charming?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Undoubtedly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>said Margaret. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) is probably the son of
Madge, and Madge is dreadful. But this place has wonderful powers.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you mean?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because I probably agree with you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It kills what is dreadful and makes what is beautiful live.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do agree,''  (<font color='red'><b>Helen</b></font>)</div>said Helen, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) sipped the milk. <div class="bookquote">``But
you said that the house was dead not half an hour ago.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Meaning that I was dead. I felt it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, the house has a surer life than we, even if it was
empty, and, as it is, I can't get over that for thirty years
the sun has never shone full on our furniture. After all,
Wickham Place was a grave. Meg, I've a startling idea.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What is it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Drink some milk to steady you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div><p/>Margaret obeyed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I won't tell you yet,''  (<font color='red'><b>Helen</b></font>)</div>said Helen, <div class="bookquote">``because you may
laugh or be angry. Let's go upstairs first and give the
rooms an airing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Helen</b></font>)</div><p/>They opened window after window, till the inside, too,
was rustling to the spring. Curtains blew, picture-frames
tapped cheerfully. Helen uttered cries of excitement as she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>)
found this bed obviously in its right place, that in its
wrong one. She (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) was angry with Miss Avery for not having
moved the wardrobes up. <div class="bookquote">``Then one would see really.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>)
admired the view. She (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) was the Helen who had written the
memorable letters four years ago. As they leant out,
looking westward, she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) said: <div class="bookquote">``About my idea. Couldn't you
and I camp out in this house for the night?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think we could well do that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>said Margaret.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here are beds, tables, towels--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know; but the house isn't supposed to be slept in,
and Henry's suggestion was--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I require no suggestions. I shall not alter anything
in my plans. But it would give me so much pleasure to have
one night here with you. It will be something to look back
on. Oh, Meg lovey, do let's!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But, Helen, my pet,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>said Margaret, <div class="bookquote">``we can't without
getting Henry's leave. Of course, he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) would give it, but you
said yourself that you couldn't visit at Ducie Street now,
and this is equally intimate.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ducie Street is his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) house. This is ours. Our
furniture, our sort of people coming to the door. Do let us
camp out, just one night, and Tom shall feed us on eggs and
milk. Why not? It's a moon.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div><p/>Margaret hesitated. <div class="bookquote">``I feel Charles wouldn't like it,''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) said at last. <div class="bookquote">``Even our furniture annoyed him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>), and I
was going to clear it out when Aunt Juley's illness
prevented me. I sympathize with Charles. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) feels it's his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
mother's house. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) loves it in rather an untaking way.
Henry I could answer for--not Charles.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) won't like it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Helen</b></font>)</div>said Helen. ``But I am going
to pass out of their lives. What difference will it make in
the long run if they say, <div class="bookquote">``And she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) even spent the night at
Howards End'?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How do you know you'll pass out of their lives? We
have thought that twice before.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because my plans--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">''--which you change in a moment.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then because my life is great and theirs are little,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Helen</b></font>)</div>said Helen, taking fire. <div class="bookquote">``I know of things they can't know
of, and so do you. We know that there's poetry. We know
that there's death. They can only take them on hearsay. We
know this is our house, because it feels ours. Oh, they may
take the title-deeds and the doorkeys, but for this one
night we are at home.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It would be lovely to have you once more alone,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>said
Margaret. <div class="bookquote">``It may be a chance in a thousand.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, and we could talk.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) dropped her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) voice. <div class="bookquote">``It
won't be a very glorious story. But under that
wych-elm--honestly, I see little happiness ahead. Cannot I
have this one night with you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I needn't say how much it would mean to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then let us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is no good hesitating. Shall I drive down to Hilton
now and get leave?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, we don't want leave.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div><p/>But Margaret was a loyal wife. In spite of imagination
and poetry--perhaps on account of them--she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) could sympathize
with the technical attitude that Henry would adopt. If
possible, she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) would be technical, too. A night's
lodging--and they demanded no more--need not involve the
discussion of general principles.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Charles may say no,''  (<font color='red'><b>Helen</b></font>)</div>grumbled Helen.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We shan't consult him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Go if you like; I should have stopped without leave.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Helen</b></font>)</div><p/>It was the touch of selfishness, which was not enough to
mar Helen's character, and even added to its beauty. She (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>)
would have stopped without leave, and escaped to Germany the
next morning. Margaret kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Expect me back before dark. I am looking forward to it
so much. It is like you to have thought of such a beautiful
thing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not a thing, only an ending,''  (<font color='red'><b>Helen</b></font>)</div>said Helen rather sadly;
and the sense of tragedy closed in on Margaret again as soon
as she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) left the house.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) was afraid of Miss Avery. It is disquieting to
fulfil a prophecy, however superficially. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) was glad to
see no watching figure as she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) drove past the farm, but only
little Tom, turning somersaults in the straw.


<p/>Chapter 38

<p/>The tragedy began quietly enough, and like many another
talk, by the man's deft assertion of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) superiority. Henry
heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) arguing with the driver, stepped out and settled
the fellow, who was inclined to be rude, and then led the
way to some chairs on the lawn. Dolly, who had not been
<div class="bookquote">``told,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dolly</b></font>)</div>ran out with offers of tea. He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) refused them, and
ordered her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) to wheel baby's perambulator away, as they
desired to be alone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But the diddums can't listen; he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) isn't nine months
old,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) pleaded.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's not what I was saying,''  (<font color='red'><b>father-in-law</b></font>)</div>retorted her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) father-in-law.

<p/>Baby was wheeled out of earshot, and did not hear about
the crisis till later years. It was now the turn of Margaret.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it what we feared?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>father-in-law</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear girl,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>father-in-law</b></font>) began, <div class="bookquote">``there is a troublesome business
ahead of us, and nothing but the most absolute honesty and
plain speech will see us through.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Margaret bent her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) head.
<div class="bookquote">``I am obliged to question you on subjects we'd both prefer
to leave untouched. As you know, I am not one of your
Bernard Shaws who consider nothing sacred. To speak as I
must will pain me, but there are occasions--We are husband
and wife, not children. I am a man of the world, and you
are a most exceptional woman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div><p/>All Margaret's senses forsook her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) blushed, and
looked past him (<font color='blue'><b>father-in-law</b></font>) at the Six Hills, covered with spring
herbage. Noting her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) colour, he (<font color='blue'><b>father-in-law</b></font>) grew still more kind.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I see that you feel as I felt when--My poor little
wife! Oh, be brave! Just one or two questions, and I have
done with you. Was your sister wearing a wedding-ring?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div><p/>Margaret stammered a <div class="bookquote">``No.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div><p/>There was an appalling silence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Henry, I really came to ask a favour about Howards End.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``One point at a time. I am now obliged to ask for the
name of her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) seducer.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) rose to her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) feet and held the chair between them.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) colour had ebbed, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) was grey. It did not
displease him (<font color='blue'><b>father-in-law</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) should receive his (<font color='blue'><b>father-in-law</b></font>) question thus.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Take your time,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>father-in-law</b></font>) counselled her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Remember that
this is far worse for me than for you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) swayed; he (<font color='blue'><b>father-in-law</b></font>) feared she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) was going to faint. Then
speech came, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) said slowly: <div class="bookquote">``Seducer? No; I do not
know her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) seducer's name.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Would she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) not tell you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I never even asked her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) who seduced her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>said Margaret,
dwelling on the hateful word thoughtfully.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That is singular.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>father-in-law</b></font>) changed his (<font color='blue'><b>father-in-law</b></font>) mind. <div class="bookquote">``Natural
perhaps, dear girl, that you shouldn't ask. But until his (<font color='blue'><b>seducer</b></font>)
name is known, nothing can be done. Sit down. How terrible
it is to see you so upset! I knew you weren't fit for it.
I wish I hadn't taken you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div><p/>Margaret answered, <div class="bookquote">``I like to stand, if you don't mind,
for it gives me a pleasant view of the Six Hills.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``As you like.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you anything else to ask me, Henry?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Next you must tell me whether you have gathered
anything. I have often noticed your insight, dear. I only
wish my own was as good. You may have guessed something,
even though your sister said nothing. The slightest hint
would help us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who is `we'?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought it best to ring up Charles.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That was unnecessary,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>said Margaret, growing warmer.
<div class="bookquote">``This news will give Charles disproportionate pain.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) has at once gone to call on your brother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That too was unnecessary.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Let me explain, dear, how the matter stands. You don't
think that I and my son are other than gentlemen? It is in
Helen's interests that we are acting. It is still not too
late to save her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) name.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div><p/>Then Margaret hit out for the first time. <div class="bookquote">``Are we to
make her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) seducer marry her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If possible. Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But, Henry, suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) turned out to be married
already? One has heard of such cases.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In that case he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) must pay heavily for his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) misconduct,
and be thrashed within an inch of his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) life.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>So her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) first blow missed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) was thankful of it. What
had tempted her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) to imperil both of their lives? Henry's
obtuseness had saved her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) as well as himself. Exhausted with
anger, she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) sat down again, blinking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) told her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) as
much as he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) thought fit. At last she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) said: <div class="bookquote">``May I ask you my
question now?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly, my dear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Tomorrow Helen goes to Munich--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, possibly she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) is right.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Henry, let a lady finish. Tomorrow she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) goes; tonight,
with your permission, she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) would like to sleep at Howards End.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>It was the crisis of his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) life. Again she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) would have
recalled the words as soon as they were uttered. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) had
not led up to them with sufficient care. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) longed to warn
him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) that they were far more important than he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) supposed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) weighing them, as if they were a business proposition.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why Howards End?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) said at last. <div class="bookquote">``Would she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) not be
more comfortable, as I suggested, at the hotel?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div><p/>Margaret hastened to give him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) reasons. <div class="bookquote">``It is an odd
request, but you know what Helen is and what women in her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>)
state are.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) frowned, and moved irritably. ``She (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) has the
idea that one night in your house would give her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) pleasure
and do her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) good. I think she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>)'s right. Being one of those
imaginative girls, the presence of all our books and
furniture soothes her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>). This is a fact. It is the end of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) girlhood. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) last words to me were, <div class="bookquote">``A beautiful ending.'''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) values the old furniture for sentimental reasons,
in fact.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Exactly. You have quite understood. It is her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) last
hope of being with it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't agree there, my dear! Helen will have her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>)
share of the goods wherever she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) goes--possibly more than her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>)
share, for you are so fond of her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) that you'd give her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>)
anything of yours that she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) fancies, wouldn't you? and I'd
raise no objection. I could understand it if it was her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) old
home, because a home, or a house'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) changed the word,
designedly; he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) had thought of a telling point--<div class="bookquote">``because a
house in which one has once lived becomes in a sort of way
sacred, I don't know why. Associations and so on. Now
Helen has no associations with Howards End, though I and
Charles and Evie have. I do not see why she (<font color='blue'><b>Evie</b></font>) wants to stay
the night there. She (<font color='blue'><b>Evie</b></font>) will only catch cold.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Leave it that you don't see,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>cried Margaret. <div class="bookquote">``Call it
fancy. But realize that fancy is a scientific fact. Helen
is fanciful, and wants to.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) surprised her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)--a rare occurrence. He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) shot an
unexpected bolt. <div class="bookquote">``If she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) wants to sleep one night, she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) may
want to sleep two. We shall never get her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) out of the house,
perhaps.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well?''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>said Margaret, with the precipice in sight.
<div class="bookquote">``And suppose we don't get her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) out of the house? Would it
matter? She (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) would do no one any harm.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Again the irritated gesture.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, Henry,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) panted, receding. <div class="bookquote">``I didn't mean
that. We will only trouble Howards End for this one night.
I take her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) to London tomorrow--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you intend to sleep in a damp house, too?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) cannot be left alone.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's quite impossible! Madness. You must be here to
meet Charles.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have already told you that your message to Charles
was unnecessary, and I have no desire to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Margaret--my Margaret--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What has this business to do with Charles? If it
concerns me little, it concerns you less, and Charles not at
all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``As the future owner of Howards End,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wilcox/Wilcox</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Wilcox,
arching his (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) fingers, <div class="bookquote">``I should say that it did concern Charles.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wilcox/Wilcox</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In what way? Will Helen's condition depreciate the property?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear, you are forgetting yourself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think you yourself recommended plain speaking.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They looked at each other in amazement. The precipice
was at their feet now.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Helen commands my sympathy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Henry</b></font>)</div>said Henry. <div class="bookquote">``As your
husband, I shall do all for her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) that I can, and I have no
doubt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) will prove more sinned against than sinning.
But I cannot treat her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) as if nothing has happened. I should
be false to my position in society if I did.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) controlled herself for the last time. <div class="bookquote">``No, let us
go back to Helen's request,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``It is unreasonable,
but the request of an unhappy girl. Tomorrow she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) will go to
Germany, and trouble society no longer. Tonight she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) asks to
sleep in your empty house--a house which you do not care
about, and which you have not occupied for over a year. May
she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)? Will you give my sister leave? Will you forgive
her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)--as you hope to be forgiven, and as you have actually
been forgiven? Forgive her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) for one night only. That will
be enough.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``As I have actually been forgiven--?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never mind for the moment what I mean by that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>said
Margaret. <div class="bookquote">``Answer my question.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>Perhaps some hint of her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) meaning did dawn on him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>). If
so, he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) blotted it out. Straight from his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) fortress he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)
answered: <div class="bookquote">``I seem rather unaccommodating, but I have some
experience of life, and know how one thing leads to
another. I am afraid that your sister had better sleep at
the hotel. I have my children and the memory of my dear
wife to consider. I am sorry, but see that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) leaves my
house at once.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You mentioned Mrs. Wilcox.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I beg your pardon?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A rare occurrence. In reply, may I mention Mrs. Bast?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You have not been yourself all day,''  (<font color='red'><b>Henry</b></font>)</div>said Henry, and
rose from his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) seat with face unmoved. Margaret rushed at
him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) and seized both his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) hands. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) was transfigured.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not any more of this!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) cried. ``You shall see the
connection if it kills you, Henry! You have had a
mistress--I forgave you. My sister has a lover--you drive
her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) from the house. Do you see the connection? Stupid,
hypocritical, cruel--oh, contemptible! --a man who insults
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife when she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)'s alive and cants with her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) memory when
she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)'s dead. A man who ruins a woman for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pleasure, and
casts her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) off to ruin other men. And gives bad financial
advice, and then says he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is not responsible. These, man,
are you. You can't recognize them, because you cannot
connect. I've had enough of your unweeded kindness. I've
spoilt you long enough. All your life you have been
spoiled. Mrs. Wilcox spoiled you. No one has ever told
what you are--muddled, criminally muddled. Men like you use
repentance as a blind, so don't repent. Only say to
yourself, <div class="bookquote">``What Helen has done, I've done.'''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The two cases are different,''  (<font color='red'><b>Henry</b></font>)</div>Henry stammered. His (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)
real retort was not quite ready. His (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) brain was still in a
whirl, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) wanted a little longer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``In what way different? You have betrayed Mrs. Wilcox,
Helen only herself. You remain in society, Helen can't.
You have had only pleasure, she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) may die. You have the
insolence to talk to me of differences, Henry?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Oh, the uselessness of it! Henry's retort came.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I perceive you are attempting blackmail. It is
scarcely a pretty weapon for a wife to use against her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
husband. My rule through life has been never to pay the
least attention to threats, and I can only repeat what I
said before: I do not give you and your sister leave to
sleep at Howards End.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div><p/>Margaret loosed his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) hands. He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) went into the house,
wiping first one and then the other on his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) handkerchief.
For a little she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) stood looking at the Six Hills, tombs of
warriors, breasts of the spring. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) passed out into
what was now the evening.


<p/>Chapter 39

<p/>Charles and Tibby met at Ducie Street, where the latter was
staying. Their interview was short and absurd. They had
nothing in common but the English language, and tried by its
help to express what neither of them understood. Charles
saw in Helen the family foe. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) had singled her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) out as the
most dangerous of the Schlegels, and, angry as he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) was,
looked forward to telling his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) wife how right he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) had been.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) mind was made up at once: the girl must be got out of
the way before she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) disgraced them farther. If occasion
offered she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) might be married to a villain or, possibly, to a
fool. But this was a concession to morality, it formed no
part of his (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) main scheme. Honest and hearty was Charles's
dislike, and the past spread itself out very clearly before
him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>); hatred is a skilful compositor. As if they were heads
in a note-book, he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) ran through all the incidents of the
Schlegels' campaign: the attempt to compromise his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) brother,
his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) mother's legacy, his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) father's marriage, the introduction
of the furniture, the unpacking of the same. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) had not yet
heard of the request to sleep at Howards End; that was to be
their master-stroke and the opportunity for his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>). But he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
already felt that Howards End was the objective, and, though
he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) disliked the house, was determined to defend it.

<p/>Tibby, on the other hand, had no opinions. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) stood
above the conventions: his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) sister had a right to do what she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)
thought right. It is not difficult to stand above the
conventions when we leave no hostages among them; men can
always be more unconventional than women, and a bachelor of
independent means need encounter no difficulties at all.
Unlike Charles, Tibby had money enough; his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) ancestors had
earned it for him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>), and if he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) shocked the people in one set
of lodgings he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) had only to move into another. His (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) was the
leisure without sympathy--an attitude as fatal as the
strenuous: a little cold culture may be raised on it, but no
art. His (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) sisters had seen the family danger, and had never
forgotten to discount the gold islets that raised them from
the sea. Tibby gave all the praise to himself, and so
despised the struggling and the submerged.

<p/>Hence the absurdity of the interview; the gulf between
them was economic as well as spiritual. But several facts
passed: Charles pressed for them with an impertinence that
the undergraduate could not withstand. On what date had
Helen gone abroad? To whom? -LRB-Charles was anxious to fasten
the scandal on Germany.-RRB- Then, changing his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) tactics, he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) said
roughly: <div class="bookquote">``I suppose you realize that you are your sister's
protector?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In what sense?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If a man played about with my sister, I'd send a bullet
through him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), but perhaps you don't mind.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I mind very much,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tibby</b></font>)</div>protested Tibby.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who d'ye suspect, then? Speak out, man. One always
suspects someone.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No one. I don't think so.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Involuntarily he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) blushed.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) had remembered the scene in his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) Oxford rooms.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are hiding something,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charles/Wilcox/Charles Wilcox</b></font>)</div>said Charles. As interviews
go, he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) got the best of this one. <div class="bookquote">``When you saw her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) last,
did she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) mention anyone's name? Yes, or no!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) thundered,
so that Tibby started.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``In my rooms she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) mentioned some friends, called the Basts--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who are the Basts?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``People--friends of hers at Evie's wedding.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't remember. But, by great Scott! I do. My aunt
told me about some tag-rag. Was she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) full of them when you
saw her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>)? Is there a man? Did she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) speak of the man?
Or--look here--have you had any dealings with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tibby</b></font>)</div><p/>Tibby was silent. Without intending it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) had betrayed
his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) sister's confidence; he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) was not enough interested in
human life to see where things will lead to. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) had a
strong regard for honesty, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) word, once given, had
always been kept up to now. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) was deeply vexed, not only
for the harm he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) had done Helen, but for the flaw he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) had
discovered in his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) own equipment.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I see--you are in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) confidence. They met at your
rooms. Oh, what a family, what a family! God help the poor
pater--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tibby</b></font>)</div><p/>And Tibby found himself alone.


<p/>Chapter 40

<p/>Leonard--he (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) would figure at length in a newspaper report,
but that evening he (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) did not count for much. The foot of the
tree was in shadow, since the moon was still hidden behind
the house. But above, to right, to left, down the long
meadow the moonlight was streaming. Leonard seemed not a
man, but a cause.

<p/>Perhaps it was Helen's way of falling in love--a curious
way to Margaret, whose agony and whose contempt of Henry
were yet imprinted with his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) image. Helen forgot people.
They were husks that had enclosed her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) emotion. She (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) could
pity, or sacrifice herself, or have instincts, but had she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>)
ever loved in the noblest way, where man and woman, having
lost themselves in sex, desire to lose sex itself in
comradeship?

<p/>Margaret wondered, but said no word of blame. This was
Helen's evening. Troubles enough lay ahead of her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>)--the loss
of friends and of social advantages, the agony, the supreme
agony, of motherhood, which is even yet not a matter of
common knowledge. For the present let the moon shine
brightly and the breezes of the spring blow gently, dying
away from the gale of the day, and let the earth, who brings
increase, bring peace. Not even to herself dare she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) blame
Helen. She (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) could not assess her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) trespass by any moral code;
it was everything or nothing. Morality can tell us that
murder is worse than stealing, and group most sins in an
order all must approve, but it cannot group Helen. The
surer its pronouncements on this point, the surer may we be
that morality is not speaking. Christ was evasive when they
questioned Him (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>). It is those that cannot connect who hasten
to cast the first stone.

<p/>This was Helen's evening--won at what cost, and not to
be marred by the sorrows of others. Of her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) own tragedy
Margaret never uttered a word.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``One isolates,''  (<font color='red'><b>Helen</b></font>)</div>said Helen slowly. <div class="bookquote">``I isolated Mr.
Wilcox from the other forces that were pulling Leonard
downhill. Consequently, I was full of pity, and almost of
revenge. For weeks I had blamed Mr. Wilcox only, and so,
when your letters came--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I need never have written them,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>sighed Margaret.
<div class="bookquote">``They never shielded Henry. How hopeless it is to tidy away
the past, even for others!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I did not know that it was your own idea to dismiss the
Basts.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Looking back, that was wrong of me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Looking back, darling, I know that it was right. It is
right to save the man whom one loves. I am less
enthusiastic about justice now. But we both thought you
wrote at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) dictation. It seemed the last touch of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
callousness. Being very much wrought up by this time--and
Mrs. Bast was upstairs. I had not seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Bast</b></font>), and had talked
for a long time to Leonard--I had snubbed him (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) for no reason,
and that should have warned me I was in danger. So when the
notes came I wanted us to go to you for an explanation. He (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>)
said that he (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) guessed the explanation--he (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) knew of it, and you
mustn't know. I pressed him (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) to tell me. He (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) said no one
must know; it was something to do with his (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) wife. Right up
to the end we were Mr. Bast and Miss Schlegel. I was going
to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Bast</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bast</b></font>) must be frank with me when I saw his (<font color='blue'><b>Bast</b></font>)
eyes, and guessed that Mr. Wilcox had ruined him (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) in two
ways, not one. I drew him (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) to me. I made him (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) tell me. I
felt very lonely myself. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) is not to blame. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) would have
gone on worshipping me. I want never to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) again,
though it sounds appalling. I wanted to give him (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) money and
feel finished. Oh, Meg, the little that is known about
these things!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) laid her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) face against the tree.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The little, too, that is known about growth! Both
times it was loneliness, and the night, and panic
afterwards. Did Leonard grow out of Paul?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div><p/>Margaret did not speak for a moment. So tired was she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
that her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) attention had actually wandered to the teeth--the
teeth that had been thrust into the tree's bark to medicate
it. From where she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) sat she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) could see them gleam. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) had
been trying to count them. <div class="bookquote">``Leonard is a better growth than
madness,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I was afraid that you would react
against Paul until you went over the verge.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I did react until I found poor Leonard. I am steady
now. I shan't ever like your Henry, dearest Meg, or even
speak kindly about him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>), but all that blinding hate is over.
I shall never rave against Wilcoxes any more. I understand
how you married him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>), and you will now be very happy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div><p/>Margaret did not reply.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Helen</b></font>)</div>repeated Helen, her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) voice growing more tender, <div class="bookquote">``I
do at last understand.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Helen</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Except Mrs. Wilcox, dearest, no one understands our
little movements.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because in death--I agree.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not quite. I feel that you and I and Henry are only
fragments of that woman's mind. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) knows everything. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
is everything. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is the house, and the tree that leans
over it. People have their own deaths as well as their own
lives, and even if there is nothing beyond death, we shall
differ in our nothingness. I cannot believe that knowledge
such as hers will perish with knowledge such as mine. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
knew about realities. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) knew when people were in love,
though she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was not in the room. I don't doubt that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) knew
when Henry deceived her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good-night, Mrs. Wilcox,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>called a voice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, good-night, Miss Avery.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why should Miss Avery work for us?''  (<font color='red'><b>Helen</b></font>)</div>Helen murmured.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, indeed?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Avery/Avery</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Avery crossed the lawn and merged into the hedge
that divided it from the farm. An old gap, which Mr. Wilcox
had filled up, had reappeared, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Avery</b></font>) track through the dew
followed the path that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) had turfed over, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) improved
the garden and made it possible for games.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This is not quite our house yet,''  (<font color='red'><b>Helen</b></font>)</div>said Helen. <div class="bookquote">``When
Miss Avery called, I felt we are only a couple of tourists.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We shall be that everywhere, and for ever.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But affectionate tourists--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But tourists who pretend each hotel is their home.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't pretend very long,''  (<font color='red'><b>Helen</b></font>)</div>said Helen. <div class="bookquote">``Sitting under
this tree one forgets, but I know that tomorrow I shall see
the moon rise out of Germany. Not all your goodness can
alter the facts of the case. Unless you will come with me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div><p/>Margaret thought for a moment. In the past year she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) had
grown so fond of England that to leave it was a real grief.
Yet what detained her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>)? No doubt Henry would pardon her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>)
outburst, and go on blustering and muddling into a ripe old
age. But what was the good? She (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) had just as soon vanish
from his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) mind.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you serious in asking me, Helen? Should I get on
with your Monica?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You would not, but I am serious in asking you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Still, no more plans now. And no more reminiscences.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They were silent for a little. It was Helen's evening.

<p/>The present flowed by them like a stream. The tree
rustled. It had made music before they were born, and would
continue after their deaths, but its song was of the
moment. The moment had passed. The tree rustled again.
Their senses were sharpened, and they seemed to apprehend
life. Life passed. The tree nestled again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sleep now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>said Margaret.

<p/>The peace of the country was entering into her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>). It has
no commerce with memory, and little with hope. Least of all
is it concerned with the hopes of the next five minutes. It
is the peace of the present, which passes understanding.
Its murmur came <div class="bookquote">``now,''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>and <div class="bookquote">``now''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>once more as they trod the
gravel, and <div class="bookquote">``now,''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>as the moonlight fell upon their father's
sword. They passed upstairs, kissed, and amidst the endless
iterations fell asleep. The house had enshadowed the tree
at first, but as the moon rose higher the two disentangled,
and were clear for a few moments at midnight. Margaret
awoke and looked into the garden. How incomprehensible that
Leonard Bast should have won her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) this night of peace! Was
he (<font color='blue'><b>Bast</b></font>) also part of Mrs. Wilcox's mind?


<p/>Chapter 41

<p/>Far different was Leonard's development. The months after
Oniton, whatever minor troubles they might bring him (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>), were
all overshadowed by Remorse. When Helen looked back she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>)
could philosophize, or she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) could look into the future and
plan for her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) child. But the father saw nothing beyond his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
own sin. Weeks afterwards, in the midst of other
occupations, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) would suddenly cry out, <div class="bookquote">``Brute--you brute, I
couldn't have--''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and be rent into two people who held
dialogues. Or brown rain would descend, blotting out faces
and the sky. Even Jacky noticed the change in him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). Most
terrible were his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) sufferings when he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) awoke from sleep.
Sometimes he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was happy at first, but grew conscious of a
burden hanging to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) and weighing down his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) thoughts when
they would move. Or little irons scorched his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) body. Or a
sword stabbed him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) would sit at the edge of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) bed,
holding his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) heart and moaning, <div class="bookquote">``Oh what SHALL I do, whatever
SHALL I do?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>Nothing brought ease. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) could put distance
between him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) and the trespass, but it grew in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) soul.

<p/>Remorse is not among the eternal verities. The Greeks
were right to dethrone her (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). Her (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) action is too capricious,
as though the Erinyes selected for punishment only certain
men and certain sins. And of all means to regeneration
Remorse is surely the most wasteful. It cuts away healthy
tissues with the poisoned. It is a knife that probes far
deeper than the evil. Leonard was driven straight through
its torments and emerged pure, but enfeebled--a better man,
who would never lose control of himself again, but also a
smaller, who had less to control. Nor did purity mean
peace. The use of the knife can become a habit as hard to
shake off as passion itself, and Leonard continued to start
with a cry out of dreams.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) built up a situation that was far enough from the
truth. It never occurred to him (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) that Helen was to blame.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) forgot the intensity of their talk, the charm that had
been lent him (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) by sincerity, the magic of Oniton under
darkness and of the whispering river. Helen loved the
absolute. Leonard had been ruined absolutely, and had
appeared to her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) as a man apart, isolated from the world. A
real man, who cared for adventure and beauty, who desired to
live decently and pay his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) way, who could have travelled more
gloriously through life than the Juggernaut car that was
crushing him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). Memories of Evie's wedding had warped her (<font color='blue'><b>Evie</b></font>),
the starched servants, the yards of uneaten food, the rustle
of overdressed women, motor-cars oozing grease on the
gravel, rubbish on a pretentious band. She (<font color='blue'><b>Evie</b></font>) had tasted the
lees of this on her (<font color='blue'><b>Evie</b></font>) arrival: in the darkness, after failure,
they intoxicated her (<font color='blue'><b>Evie</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Evie</b></font>) and the victim seemed alone in a
world of unreality, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Evie</b></font>) loved him (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>) absolutely, perhaps
for half an hour.

<p/>In the morning she (<font color='blue'><b>Evie</b></font>) was gone. The note that she (<font color='blue'><b>Evie</b></font>) left,
tender and hysterical in tone, and intended to be most kind,
hurt her (<font color='blue'><b>Evie</b></font>) lover terribly. It was as if some work of art had
been broken by him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>), some picture in the National Gallery
slashed out of its frame. When he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) recalled her (<font color='blue'><b>Evie</b></font>) talents and
her (<font color='blue'><b>Evie</b></font>) social position, he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) felt that the first passerby had a
right to shoot him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) down. He (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) was afraid of the waitress and
the porters at the railway-station. He (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) was afraid at first
of his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) wife, though later he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) was to regard her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) with a
strange new tenderness, and to think, <div class="bookquote">``There is nothing to
choose between us, after all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The expedition to Shropshire crippled the Basts
permanently. Helen in her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) flight forgot to settle the hotel
bill, and took their return tickets away with her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>); they had
to pawn Jacky's bangles to get home, and the smash came a
few days afterwards. It is true that Helen offered him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) five
thousands pounds, but such a sum meant nothing to him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>)
could not see that the girl was desperately righting
herself, and trying to save something out of the disaster,
if it was only five thousand pounds. But he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) had to live
somehow. He (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) turned to his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) family, and degraded himself to a
professional beggar. There was nothing else for him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) to do.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A letter from Leonard,''  (<font color='red'><b>Blanche</b></font>)</div>thought Blanche, his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) sister;
<div class="bookquote">``and after all this time.''  (<font color='red'><b>letter sister</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Blanche</b></font>) hid it, so that her (<font color='blue'><b>Blanche</b></font>) husband
should not see, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had gone to his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) work read it
with some emotion, and sent the prodigal a little money out
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Blanche</b></font>) dress allowance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A letter from Leonard!''  (<font color='red'><b>the sister Laura</b></font>)</div>said the other sister, Laura, a
few days later. She (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) showed it to her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) husband. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) wrote a
cruel insolent reply, but sent more money than Blanche, so
Leonard soon wrote to him (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) again.

<p/>And during the winter the system was developed. Leonard
realized that they need never starve, because it would be
too painful for his (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) relatives. Society is based on the
family, and the clever wastrel can exploit this
indefinitely. Without a generous thought on either side,
pounds and pounds passed. The donors disliked Leonard, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) grew to hate them intensely. When Laura censured his (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>)
immoral marriage, he (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) thought bitterly, <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) minds that!
What would she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) say if she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) knew the truth?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>When Blanche's
husband offered him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) work, he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) found some pretext for avoiding
it. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had wanted work keenly at Oniton, but too much
anxiety had shattered him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was joining the unemployable.
When his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) brother, the lay-reader, did not reply to a letter,
he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) wrote again, saying that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) and Jacky would come down to
his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) village on foot. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) did not intend this as blackmail.
Still, the brother sent a postal order, and it became part
of the system. And so passed his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) winter and his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) spring.

<p/>In the horror there are two bright spots. He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) never
confused the past. He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) remained alive, and blessed are those
who live, if it is only to a sense of sinfulness. The
anodyne of muddledom, by which most men blur and blend their
mistakes, never passed Leonard's lips--

<p/>And if I drink oblivion of a day,
So shorten I the stature of my soul.

<p/>It is a hard saying, and a hard man wrote it, but it
lies at the foot of all character.

<p/>And the other bright spot was his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) tenderness for Jacky.
He (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) pitied her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) with nobility now--not the contemptuous pity
of a man who sticks to a woman through thick and thin. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
tried to be less irritable. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wondered what her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hungry
eyes desired--nothing that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) could express, or that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) or
any man could give her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). Would she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) ever receive the justice
that is mercy--the justice for by-products that the world is
too busy to bestow? She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was fond of flowers, generous with
money, and not revengeful. If she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had borne him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) a child he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
might have cared for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). Unmarried, Leonard would never
have begged; he (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) would have flickered out and died. But the
whole of life is mixed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) had to provide for Jacky, and
went down dirty paths that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) might have a few feathers and
dishes of food that suited her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).

<p/>One day he (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) caught sight of Margaret and her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) brother. He (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>)
was in St. Paul's. He (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) had entered the cathedral partly to
avoid the rain and partly to see a picture that had educated
him (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) in former years. But the light was bad, the picture ill
placed, and Time and Judgment were inside him (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) now. Death
alone still charmed him (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>), with her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) lap of poppies, on which
all men shall sleep. He (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) took one glance, and turned
aimlessly away towards a chair. Then down the nave he (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) saw
Miss Schlegel and her (<font color='blue'><b>Schlegel</b></font>) brother. They stood in the fairway of
passengers, and their faces were extremely grave. He (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) was
perfectly certain that they were in trouble about their sister.

<p/>Once outside--and he (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) fled immediately--he (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) wished that he (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>)
had spoken to them. What was his (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) life? What were a few
angry words, or even imprisonment? He (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) had done wrong--that
was the true terror. Whatever they might know, he (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) would
tell them everything he (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) knew. He (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) re-entered St. Paul's.
But they had moved in his (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) absence, and had gone to lay their
difficulties before Mr. Wilcox and Charles.

<p/>The sight of Margaret turned remorse into new channels.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) desired to confess, and though the desire is proof of a
weakened nature, which is about to lose the essence of human
intercourse, it did not take an ignoble form. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) did not
suppose that confession would bring him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) happiness. It was
rather that he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) yearned to get clear of the tangle. So does
the suicide yearn. The impulses are akin, and the crime of
suicide lies rather in its disregard for the feelings of
those whom we leave behind. Confession need harm no one--it
can satisfy that test--and though it was un-English, and
ignored by our Anglican cathedral, Leonard had a right to
decide upon it.

<p/>Moreover, he (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) trusted Margaret. He (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) wanted her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) hardness
now. That cold, intellectual nature of hers would be just,
if unkind. He (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) would do whatever she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) told him (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>), even if he (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>)
had to see Helen. That was the supreme punishment she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) would
exact. And perhaps she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) would tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) how Helen was. That
was the supreme reward.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) knew nothing about Margaret, not even whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) was
married to Mr. Wilcox, and tracking her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) out took several
days. That evening he (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) toiled through the wet to Wickham
Place, where the new flats were now appearing. Was he (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) also
the cause of their move? Were they expelled from society on
his (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) account? Thence to a public library, but could find no
satisfactory Schlegel in the directory. On the morrow he (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>)
searched again. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) hung about outside Mr. Wilcox's office
at lunch time, and, as the clerks came out said: <div class="bookquote">``Excuse me,
sir, but is your boss married?''  (<font color='red'><b>the clerks</b></font>)</div>Most of them stared, some
said, <div class="bookquote">``What's that to you?''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>but one, who had not yet
acquired reticence, told him (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) what he (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) wished. Leonard could
not learn the private address. That necessitated more
trouble with directories and tubes. Ducie Street was not
discovered till the Monday, the day that Margaret and her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
husband went down on their hunting expedition to Howards End.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) called at about four o'clock. The weather had
changed, and the sun shone gaily on the ornamental
steps--black and white marble in triangles. Leonard lowered
his (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) eyes to them after ringing the bell. He (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) felt in curious
health: doors seemed to be opening and shutting inside his (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>)
body, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) had been obliged to steep sitting up in bed,
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) back propped against the wall. When the
parlourmaid came he (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) could not see her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) face; the brown rain
had descended suddenly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Does Mrs. Wilcox live here?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>)'s out,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was the answer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``When will she (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) be back?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll ask,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>said the parlourmaid.

<p/>Margaret had given instructions that no one who
mentioned her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) name should ever be rebuffed. Putting the
door on the chain--for Leonard's appearance demanded
this--she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) went through to the smoking-room, which was
occupied by Tibby. Tibby was asleep. He (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) had had a good
lunch. Charles Wilcox had not yet rung him (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) up for the
distracting interview. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) said drowsily: <div class="bookquote">``I don't know.
Hilton. Howards End. Who is it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll ask, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, don't bother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They have taken the car to Howards End,''  (<font color='red'><b>Leonard/Leonard Bast/Bast</b></font>)</div>said the
parlourmaid to Leonard.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) thanked her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>), and asked whereabouts that place was.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You appear to want to know a good deal,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) remarked.
But Margaret had forbidden her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) to be mysterious. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) told
him (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) against her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) better judgment that Howards End was in
Hertfordshire.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it a village, please?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Village! It's Mr. Wilcox's private house--at least,
it's one of them. Mrs. Wilcox keeps her (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) furniture there.
Hilton is the village.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. And when will they be back?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Schlegel doesn't know. We can't know everything,
can we?''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) shut him (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) out, and went to attend to the
telephone, which was ringing furiously.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) loitered away another night of agony. Confession
grew more difficult. As soon as possible he (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) went to bed.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) watched a patch of moonlight cross the floor of their
lodging, and, as sometimes happens when the mind is
overtaxed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) fell asleep for the rest of the room, but kept
awake for the patch of moonlight. Horrible! Then began one
of those disintegrating dialogues. Part of him (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) said: <div class="bookquote">``Why
horrible? It's ordinary light from the room.''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But it
moves.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``So does the moon.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But it is a clenched fist.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Why not?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But it is going to touch me.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Let it.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>And,
seeming to gather motion, the patch ran up his (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) blanket.
Presently a blue snake appeared; then another, parallel to
it. <div class="bookquote">``Is there life in the moon?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Of course.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But I
thought it was uninhabited.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Not by Time, Death, Judgment,
and the smaller snakes.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Smaller snakes!''  (<font color='red'><b>Leonard/Leonard Bast/Bast</b></font>)</div>said Leonard
indignantly and aloud. <div class="bookquote">``What a notion!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>By a rending
effort of the will he (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) woke the rest of the room up. Jacky,
the bed, their food, their clothes on the chair, gradually
entered his (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) consciousness, and the horror vanished outwards,
like a ring that is spreading through water.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I say, Jacky, I'm going out for a bit.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) was breathing regularly. The patch of light fell
clear of the striped blanket, and began to cover the shawl
that lay over her (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) feet. Why had he (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) been afraid? He (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) went to
the window, and saw that the moon was descending through a
clear sky. He (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) volcanoes, and the bright expanses
that a gracious error has named seas. They paled, for the
sun, who had lit them up, was coming to light the earth.
Sea of Serenity, Sea of Tranquillity, Ocean of the Lunar
Storms, merged into one lucent drop, itself to slip into the
sempiternal dawn. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) had been afraid of the moon!

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) dressed among the contending lights, and went through
his (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) money. It was running low again, but enough for a
return ticket to Hilton. As it clinked Jacky opened her (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hullo, Len! What ho, Len!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What ho, Jacky! see you again later.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) turned over and slept.

<p/>The house was unlocked, their landlord being a salesman
at Convent Garden. Leonard passed out and made his (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) way down
to the station. The train, though it did not start for an
hour, was already drawn up at the end of the platform, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) lay down in it and slept. With the first jolt he (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) was in
daylight; they had left the gateways of King's Cross, and
were under blue sky. Tunnels followed, and after each the
sky grew bluer, and from the embankment at Finsbury Park he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>)
had his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) first sight of the sun. It rolled along behind the
eastern smokes--a wheel, whose fellow was the descending
moon--and as yet it seemed the servant of the blue sky, not
its lord. He (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) dozed again. Over Tewin Water it was day. To
the left fell the shadow of the embankment and its arches;
to the right Leonard saw up into the Tewin Woods and towards
the church, with its wild legend of immortality. Six forest
trees--that is a fact--grow out of one of the graves in
Tewin churchyard. The grave's occupant--that is the
legend--is an atheist, who declared that if God existed, six
forest trees would grow out of her (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) grave. These things in
Hertfordshire; and farther afield lay the house of a
hermit--Mrs. Wilcox had known him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)--who barred himself up,
and wrote prophecies, and gave all he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had to the poor.
While, powdered in between, were the villas of business men,
who saw life more steadily, though with the steadiness of
the half-closed eye. Over all the sun was streaming, to all
the birds were singing, to all the primroses were yellow,
and the speedwell blue, and the country, however they
interpreted her (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>), was uttering her (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) cry of <div class="bookquote">``now.''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) did not
free Leonard yet, and the knife plunged deeper into his (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>)
heart as the train drew up at Hilton. But remorse had
become beautiful.

<p/>Hilton was asleep, or at the earliest, breakfasting.
Leonard noticed the contrast when he (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) stepped out of it into
the country. Here men had been up since dawn. Their hours
were ruled, not by a London office, but by the movements of
the crops and the sun. That they were men of the finest
type only the sentimentalist can declare. But they kept to
the life of daylight. They are England's hope. Clumsily
they carry forward the torch of the sun, until such time as
the nation sees fit to take it up. Half clodhopper, half
board-school prig, they can still throw back to a nobler
stock, and breed yeomen.

<p/>At the chalk pit a motor passed him (<font color='blue'><b>Their</b></font>). In it was another
type, whom Nature favours--the Imperial. Healthy, ever in
motion, it hopes to inherit the earth. It breeds as quickly
as the yeoman, and as soundly; strong is the temptation to
acclaim it as a super-yeoman, who carries his (<font color='blue'><b>yeoman</b></font>) country's
virtue overseas. But the Imperialist is not what he (<font color='blue'><b>yeoman</b></font>) thinks
or seems. He (<font color='blue'><b>yeoman</b></font>) is a destroyer. He (<font color='blue'><b>yeoman</b></font>) prepares the way for
cosmopolitanism, and though his (<font color='blue'><b>yeoman</b></font>) ambitions may be fulfilled,
the earth that he (<font color='blue'><b>yeoman</b></font>) inherits will be grey.

<p/>To Leonard, intent on his (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) private sin, there came the
conviction of innate goodness elsewhere. It was not the
optimism which he (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) had been taught at school. Again and
again must the drums tap, and the goblins stalk over the
universe before joy can be purged of the superficial. It
was rather paradoxical, and arose from his (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) sorrow. Death
destroys a man, but the idea of death saves him (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>)--that is the
best account of it that has yet been given. Squalor and
tragedy can beckon to all that is great in us, and
strengthen the wings of love. They can beckon; it is not
certain that they will, for they are not love's servants.
But they can beckon, and the knowledge of this incredible
truth comforted him (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>).

<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) approached the house all thought stopped.
Contradictory notions stood side by side in his (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) mind. He (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>)
was terrified but happy, ashamed, but had done no sin. He (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>)
knew the confession: <div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Wilcox, I have done wrong,''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>but
sunrise had robbed its meaning, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) felt rather on a
supreme adventure.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) entered a garden, steadied himself against a
motor-car that he (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) found in it, found a door open and entered
a house. Yes, it would be very easy. From a room to the
left he (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) heard voices, Margaret's amongst them. His (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) own name
was called aloud, and a man whom he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had never seen said,
<div class="bookquote">``Oh, is he (<font color='blue'><b>Len</b></font>) there? I am not surprised. I now thrash him (<font color='blue'><b>Len</b></font>)
within an inch of his (<font color='blue'><b>Len</b></font>) life.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Wilcox,''  (<font color='red'><b>Leonard/Leonard Bast/Bast</b></font>)</div>said Leonard, <div class="bookquote">``I have done wrong.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Leonard/Leonard Bast/Bast</b></font>)</div><p/>The man took him (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) by the collar and cried, <div class="bookquote">``Bring me a
stick.''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Women were screaming. A stick, very bright,
descended. It hurt him (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>), not where it descended, but in the
heart. Books fell over him (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) in a shower. Nothing had sense.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Get some water,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charles/Wilcox/Charles Wilcox</b></font>)</div>commanded Charles, who had all through
kept very calm. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Len</b></font>)'s shamming. Of course I only used the
blade. Here, carry him (<font color='blue'><b>Len</b></font>) out into the air.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Thinking that he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) understood these things, Margaret
obeyed him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>). They laid Leonard, who was dead, on the gravel;
Helen poured water over him (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's enough,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charles/Wilcox/Charles Wilcox</b></font>)</div>said Charles.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, murder's enough,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Avery/Avery</b></font>)</div>said Miss Avery, coming out of
the house with the sword.


<p/>Chapter 42

<p/>When Charles left Ducie Street he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) had caught the first train
home, but had no inkling of the newest development until
late at night. Then his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) father, who had dined alone, sent
for him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>), and in very grave tones inquired for Margaret.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know where she (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) is, pater,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charles/Wilcox/Charles Wilcox</b></font>)</div>said Charles.
<div class="bookquote">``Dolly kept back dinner nearly an hour for her (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell me when she (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) comes in--.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Another hour passed. The servants went to bed, and
Charles visited his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) father again, to receive further
instructions. Mrs. Wilcox had still not returned.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll sit up for her (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) as late as you like, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) can
hardly be coming. Isn't she (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) stopping with her (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) sister at the
hotel?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wilcox/Wilcox</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Wilcox thoughtfully--<div class="bookquote">``perhaps.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wilcox/Wilcox</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Can I do anything for you, sir?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not tonight, my boy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wilcox/Wilcox</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Wilcox liked being called sir. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) eyes
and gave his (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) son more open a look of tenderness than he (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>)
usually ventured. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) saw Charles as little boy and strong
man in one. Though his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) wife had proved unstable his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
children were left to him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>).

<p/>After midnight he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) tapped on Charles's door. <div class="bookquote">``I can't
sleep,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I had better have a talk with you and get
it over.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) complained of the heat. Charles took him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) out into
the garden, and they paced up and down in their
dressing-gowns. Charles became very quiet as the story
unrolled; he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) had known all along that Margaret was as bad as
her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) sister.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) will feel differently in the morning,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wilcox/Wilcox</b></font>)</div>said Mr.
Wilcox, who had of course said nothing about Mrs. Bast.
<div class="bookquote">``But I cannot let this kind of thing continue without
comment. I am morally certain that she (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) is with her (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) sister
at Howards End. The house is mine--and, Charles, it will be
yours--and when I say that no one is to live there, I mean
that no one is to live there. I won't have it.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) looked
angrily at the moon. <div class="bookquote">``To my mind this question is connected
with something far greater, the rights of property itself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Undoubtedly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charles/Wilcox/Charles Wilcox</b></font>)</div>said Charles.

<p/>Mr. Wilcox linked his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) arm in his (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) son's, but somehow
liked him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) less as he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) told him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) more. <div class="bookquote">``I don't want you to
conclude that my wife and I had anything of the nature of a
quarrel. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was only over-wrought, as who would not be? I
shall do what I can for Helen, but on the understanding that
they clear out of the house at once. Do you see? That is a
sine qua non.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then at eight tomorrow I may go up in the car?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Eight or earlier. Say that you are acting as my
representative, and, of course, use no violence, Charles.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charles/Wilcox/Charles Wilcox</b></font>)</div><p/>On the morrow, as Charles returned, leaving Leonard dead
upon the gravel, it did not seem to him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) had used
violence. Death was due to heart disease. His (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) stepmother
herself had said so, and even Miss Avery had acknowledged
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) only used the flat of the sword. On his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) way through
the village he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) informed the police, who thanked him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>), and
said there must be an inquest. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) found his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) father in the
garden shading his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) eyes from the sun.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It has been pretty horrible,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charles/Wilcox/Charles Wilcox</b></font>)</div>said Charles gravely.
<div class="bookquote">``They were there, and they had the man up there with them too.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What--what man?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I told you last night. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) name was Bast.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My God, is it possible?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wilcox/Wilcox</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Wilcox. <div class="bookquote">``In your
mother's house! Charles, in your mother's house!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know, pater. That was what I felt. As a matter of
fact, there is no need to trouble about the man. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was in
the last stages of heart disease, and just before I could
show him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) what I thought of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) went off. The police are
seeing about it at this moment.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wilcox/Wilcox</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Wilcox listened attentively.

<p/>``I got up there--oh, it couldn't have been more than
half-past seven. The Avery woman was lighting a fire for
them. They were still upstairs. I waited in the
drawing-room. We were all moderately civil and collected,
though I had my suspicions. I gave them your message, and
Mrs. Wilcox said, ``Oh yes, I see; yes,<div class="bookquote">'' in that way of hers.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing else?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I promised to tell you, `with her (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) love,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>that she (<font color='blue'><b>Avery</b></font>) was
going to Germany with her (<font color='blue'><b>Avery</b></font>) sister this evening. That was all
we had time for.''

<p/>Mr. Wilcox seemed relieved.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Because by then I suppose the man got tired of hiding,
for suddenly Mrs. Wilcox screamed out his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) name. I
recognized it, and I went for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in the hall. Was I right,
pater? I thought things were going a little too far.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Right, my dear boy? I don't know. But you would have
been no son of mine if you hadn't. Then did he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)
just--just--crumple up as you said?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) shrunk from the
simple word.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) caught hold of the bookcase, which came down over
him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>). So I merely put the sword down and carried him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) into
the garden. We all thought he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) was shamming. However, he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)'s
dead right enough. Awful business!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sword?''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>cried his (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) father, with anxiety in his (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) voice.
<div class="bookquote">``What sword? Whose sword?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A sword of theirs.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What were you doing with it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, didn't you see, pater, I had to snatch up the
first thing handy I hadn't a riding-whip or stick. I caught
him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) once or twice over the shoulders with the flat of their
old German sword.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then what?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) pulled over the bookcase, as I said, and fell,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charles/Wilcox/Charles Wilcox</b></font>)</div>said
Charles, with a sigh. It was no fun doing errands for his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
father, who was never quite satisfied.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But the real cause was heart disease? Of that you're sure?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That or a fit. However, we shall hear more than enough
at the inquest on such unsavoury topics.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They went into breakfast. Charles had a racking
headache, consequent on motoring before food. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) was also
anxious about the future, reflecting that the police must
detain Helen and Margaret for the inquest and ferret the
whole thing out. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) saw himself obliged to leave Hilton.
One could not afford to live near the scene of a scandal--it
was not fair on one's wife. His (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) comfort was that the
pater's eyes were opened at last. There would be a horrible
smash up, and probably a separation from Margaret; then they
would all start again, more as they had been in his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) mother's
time.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think I'll go round to the police-station,''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
father when breakfast was over.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What for?''  (<font color='red'><b>Dolly</b></font>)</div>cried Dolly, who had still not been <div class="bookquote">``told.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dolly</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well, sir. Which car will you have?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think I'll walk.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's a good half-mile,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charles/Wilcox/Charles Wilcox</b></font>)</div>said Charles, stepping into the
garden. <div class="bookquote">``The sun's very hot for April. Shan't I take you
up, and then, perhaps, a little spin round by Tewin?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You go on as if I didn't know my own mind,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wilcox/Wilcox</b></font>)</div>said Mr.
Wilcox fretfully. Charles hardened his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) mouth. <div class="bookquote">``You young
fellows' one idea is to get into a motor. I tell you, I
want to walk: I'm very fond of walking.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, all right; I'm about the house if you want me for
anything. I thought of not going up to the office today, if
that is your wish.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is, indeed, my boy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wilcox/Wilcox</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Wilcox, and laid a
hand on his (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) sleeve.

<p/>Charles did not like it; he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) was uneasy about his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) father,
who did not seem himself this morning. There was a petulant
touch about him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)--more like a woman. Could it be that he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) was
growing old? The Wilcoxes were not lacking in affection;
they had it royally, but they did not know how to use it.
It was the talent in the napkin, and, for a warm-hearted
man, Charles had conveyed very little joy. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) watched
his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) father shuffling up the road, he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) had a vague regret--a
wish that something had been different somewhere--a wish
-LRB-though he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) did not express it thus-RRB- that he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) had been taught
to say <div class="bookquote">``I''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>in his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) youth. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) meant to make up for Margaret's
defection, but knew that his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) father had been very happy with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) until yesterday. How had she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) done it? By some
dishonest trick, no doubt--but how?

<p/>Mr. Wilcox reappeared at eleven, looking very tired.
There was to be an inquest on Leonard's' body tomorrow, and
the police required his (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) son to attend.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I expected that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charles/Wilcox/Charles Wilcox</b></font>)</div>said Charles. <div class="bookquote">``I shall naturally be
the most important witness there.''


 (<font color='red'><b>Aunt Juley/Juley</b></font>)</div><p/>Chapter 43

<p/>Out of the turmoil and horror that had begun with Aunt
Juley's illness and was not even to end with Leonard's
death, it seemed impossible to Margaret that healthy life
should re-emerge. Events succeeded in a logical, yet
senseless, train. People lost their humanity, and took
values as arbitrary as those in a pack of playing-cards. It
was natural that Henry should do this and cause Helen to do
that, and then think her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) wrong for doing it; natural that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) herself should think him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) wrong; natural that Leonard
should want to know how Helen was, and come, and Charles be
angry with him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) for coming--natural, but unreal. In this
jangle of causes and effects what had become of their true
selves? Here Leonard lay dead in the garden, from natural
causes; yet life was a deep, deep river, death a blue sky,
life was a house, death a wisp of hay, a flower, a tower,
life and death were anything and everything, except this
ordered insanity, where the king takes the queen, and the
ace the king. Ah, no; there was beauty and adventure
behind, such as the man at her (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) feet had yearned for; there
was hope this side of the grave; there were truer
relationships beyond the limits that fetter us now. As a
prisoner looks up and sees stars beckoning, so she (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>), from the
turmoil and horror of those days, caught glimpses of the
diviner wheels.

<p/>And Helen, dumb with fright, but trying to keep calm for
the child's sake, and Miss Avery, calm, but murmuring
tenderly, <div class="bookquote">``No one ever told the lad he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>)'ll have a
child'' (<font color='red'><b>Miss Avery/Avery</b></font>)</div>--they also reminded her (<font color='blue'><b>Avery</b></font>) that horror is not the end.
To what ultimate harmony we tend she (<font color='blue'><b>Avery</b></font>) did not know, but there
seemed great chance that a child would be born into the
world, to take the great chances of beauty and adventure
that the world offers. She (<font color='blue'><b>Avery</b></font>) moved through the sunlit garden,
gathering narcissi, crimson-eyed and white. There was
nothing else to be done; the time for telegrams and anger
was over, and it seemed wisest that the hands of Leonard
should be folded on his (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) breast and be filled with flowers.
Here was the father; leave it at that. Let Squalor be
turned into Tragedy, whose eyes are the stars, and whose
hands hold the sunset and the dawn.

<p/>And even the influx of officials, even the return of the
doctor, vulgar and acute, could not shake her (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) belief in the
eternity of beauty. Science explained people, but could not
understand them. After long centuries among the bones and
muscles it might be advancing to knowledge of the nerves,
but this would never give understanding. One could open the
heart to Mr. Mansbridge and his (<font color='blue'><b>Mansbridge</b></font>) sort without discovering its
secrets to them, for they wanted everything down in black
and white, and black and white was exactly what they were
left with.

<p/>They questioned her (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) closely about Charles. She (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) never
suspected why. Death had come, and the doctor agreed that
it was due to heart disease. They asked to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) father's
sword. She (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) explained that Charles's anger was natural, but
mistaken. Miserable questions about Leonard followed, all
of which she (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) answered unfalteringly. Then back to Charles
again. <div class="bookquote">``No doubt Mr. Wilcox may have induced death,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>)
said; <div class="bookquote">``but if it wasn't one thing it would have been
another, as you yourselves know.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>At last they thanked her (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>),
and took the sword and the body down to Hilton. She (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) began
to pick up the books from the floor.

<p/>Helen had gone to the farm. It was the best place for
her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>), since she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) had to wait for the inquest. Though, as if
things were not hard enough, Madge and her (<font color='blue'><b>Madge</b></font>) husband had
raised trouble; they did not see why they should receive the
offscourings of Howards End. And, of course, they were
right. The whole world was going to be right, and amply
avenge any brave talk against the conventions. <div class="bookquote">``Nothing
matters,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>the Schlegels had said in the past, <div class="bookquote">``except one's
self-respect and that of one's friends.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>When the time came,
other things mattered terribly. However, Madge had yielded,
and Helen was assured of peace for one day and night, and
tomorrow she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) would return to Germany.

<p/>As for herself, she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) determined to go too. No message
came from Henry; perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) expected her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) to apologize. Now
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) had time to think over her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) own tragedy, she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) was
unrepentant. She (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) neither forgave him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) for his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) behaviour nor
wished to forgive him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>). Her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) speech to him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) seemed perfect.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) would not have altered a word. It had to be uttered
once in a life, to adjust the lopsidedness of the world. It
was spoken not only to her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) husband, but to thousands of men
like him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)--a protest against the inner darkness in high
places that comes with a commercial age. Though he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) would
build up his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) life without hers, she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) could not apologize. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
had refused to connect, on the clearest issue that can be
laid before a man, and their love must take the consequences.

<p/>No, there was nothing more to be done. They had tried
not to go over the precipice but perhaps the fall was
inevitable. And it comforted her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) to think that the future
was certainly inevitable: cause and effect would go jangling
forward to some goal doubtless, but to none that she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) could
imagine. At such moments the soul retires within, to float
upon the bosom of a deeper stream, and has communion with
the dead, and sees the world's glory not diminished, but
different in kind to what she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) has supposed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) alters her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>)
focus until trivial things are blurred. Margaret had been
tending this way all the winter. Leonard's death brought
her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) to the goal. Alas! that Henry should fade, away as
reality emerged, and only her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) love for him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) should remain
clear, stamped with his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) image like the cameos we rescue out
of dreams.

<p/>With unfaltering eye she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) traced his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) future. He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) would
soon present a healthy mind to the world again, and what did
he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) or the world care if he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) was rotten at the core? He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) would
grow into a rich, jolly old man, at times a little
sentimental about women, but emptying his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) glass with
anyone. Tenacious of power, he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) would keep Charles and the
rest dependent, and retire from business reluctantly and at
an advanced age. He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) would settle down--though she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) could not
realize this. In her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) eyes Henry was always moving and
causing others to move, until the ends of the earth met.
But in time he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) must get too tired to move, and settle down.
What next? The inevitable word. The release of the soul to
its appropriate Heaven.

<p/>Would they meet in it? Margaret believed in immortality
for herself. An eternal future had always seemed natural to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>). And Henry believed in it for himself. Yet, would they
meet again? Are there not rather endless levels beyond the
grave, as the theory that he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) had censured teaches? And his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)
level, whether higher or lower, could it possibly be the
same as hers?

<p/>Thus gravely meditating, she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) was summoned by him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)
sent up Crane in the motor. Other servants passed like
water, but the chauffeur remained, though impertinent and
disloyal. Margaret disliked Crane, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Crane</b></font>) knew it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it the keys that Mr. Wilcox wants?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) didn't say, madam.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You haven't any note for me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) didn't say, madam.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>After a moment's thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) locked up Howards End. It
was pitiable to see in it the stirrings of warmth that would
be quenched for ever. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) raked out the fire that was
blazing in the kitchen, and spread the coals in the
gravelled yard. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) closed the windows and drew the
curtains. Henry would probably sell the place now.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) was determined not to spare him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>), for nothing new had
happened as far as they were concerned. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) mood might
never have altered from yesterday evening. He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) was standing
a little outside Charles's gate, and motioned the car to
stop. When his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) wife got out he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) said hoarsely: <div class="bookquote">``I prefer to
discuss things with you outside.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It will be more appropriate in the road, I am afraid,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>said Margaret. <div class="bookquote">``Did you get my message?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What about?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am going to Germany with my sister. I must tell you
now that I shall make it my permanent home. Our talk last
night was more important than you have realized. I am
unable to forgive you and am leaving you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am extremely tired,''  (<font color='red'><b>Henry</b></font>)</div>said Henry, in injured tones.
<div class="bookquote">``I have been walking about all the morning, and wish to sit down.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly, if you will consent to sit on the grass.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Great</b></font>)</div><p/>The Great North Road should have been bordered all its
length with glebe. Henry's kind had filched most of it.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) moved to the scrap opposite, wherein were the Six
Hills. They sat down on the farther side, so that they
could not be seen by Charles or Dolly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here are your keys,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>said Margaret. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) tossed them
towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>). They fell on the sunlit slope of grass, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
did not pick them up.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have something to tell you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) said gently.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) knew this superficial gentleness, this confession of
hastiness, that was only intended to enhance her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) admiration
of the male.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't want to hear it,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) replied. <div class="bookquote">``My sister is
going to be ill. My life is going to be with her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) now. We
must manage to build up something, she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) and I and her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) child.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Where are you going?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Munich. We start after the inquest, if she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) is not too ill.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``After the inquest?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you realized what the verdict at the inquest will be?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, heart disease.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, my dear; manslaughter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div><p/>Margaret drove her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) fingers through the grass. The hill
beneath her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) moved as if it was alive.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Manslaughter,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wilcox/Wilcox</b></font>)</div>repeated Mr. Wilcox. <div class="bookquote">``Charles may go to
prison. I dare not tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>). I don't know what to do--what
to do. I'm broken--I'm ended. ''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>No sudden warmth arose in her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) did not see that to
break him (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) was her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) only hope. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) did not enfold the
sufferer in her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) arms. But all through that day and the next
a new life began to move. The verdict was brought in.
Charles was committed for trial. It was against all reason
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) should be punished, but the law, being made in his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
image, sentenced him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) to three years' imprisonment. Then
Henry's fortress gave way. He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) could bear no one but his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)
wife, he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) shambled up to Margaret afterwards and asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) to
do what she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) could with him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) did what seemed
easiest--she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) took him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) down to recruit at Howards End.


<p/>Chapter 44

<p/>Tom's father was cutting the big meadow. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) passed again
and again amid whirring blades and sweet odours of grass,
encompassing with narrowing circles the sacred centre of the
field. Tom was negotiating with Helen.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I haven't any idea,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) replied. <div class="bookquote">``Do you suppose baby
may, Meg?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div><p/>Margaret put down her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) work and regarded them absently.
<div class="bookquote">``What was that?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tom wants to know whether baby is old enough to play
with hay?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I haven't the least notion,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>answered Margaret, and
took up her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) work again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, Tom, baby is not to stand; he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) is not to lie on his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
face; he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) is not to lie so that his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) head wags; he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) is not to
be teased or tickled; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) is not to be cut into two or
more pieces by the cutter. Will you be as careful as all that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom</b></font>)</div><p/>Tom held out his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) arms.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That child is a wonderful nursemaid,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>remarked Margaret.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) is fond of baby. That's why he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) does it!''  (<font color='red'><b>Helen</b></font>)</div>was
Helen's answer. They're going to be lifelong friends.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Starting at the ages of six and one?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course. It will be a great thing for Tom.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It may be a greater thing for baby.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div><p/>Fourteen months had passed, but Margaret still stopped
at Howards End. No better plan had occurred to her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>). The
meadow was being recut, the great red poppies were reopening
in the garden. July would follow with the little red
poppies among the wheat, August with the cutting of the
wheat. These little events would become part of her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) year
after year. Every summer she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) would fear lest the well
should give out, every winter lest the pipes should freeze;
every westerly gale might blow the wych-elm down and bring
the end of all things, and so she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) could not read or talk
during a westerly gale. The air was tranquil now. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) and
her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) sister were sitting on the remains of Evie's mockery,
where the lawn merged into the field.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What a time they all are!''  (<font color='red'><b>Helen</b></font>)</div>said Helen. <div class="bookquote">``What can they
be doing inside?''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>Margaret, who was growing less talkative,
made no answer. The noise of the cutter came
intermittently, like the breaking of waves. Close by them a
man was preparing to scythe out one of the dell-holes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish Henry was out to enjoy this,''  (<font color='red'><b>Helen</b></font>)</div>said Helen. <div class="bookquote">``This
lovely weather and to be shut up in the house! It's very hard.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It has to be,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>said Margaret. <div class="bookquote">``The hay-fever is his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)
chief objection against living here, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) thinks it worth while.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Meg, is or isn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) ill? I can't make out.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not ill. Eternally tired. He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) has worked very hard all
his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) life, and noticed nothing. Those are the people who
collapse when they do notice a thing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) worries dreadfully about his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) part of the tangle.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dreadfully. That is why I wish Dolly had not come,
too, today. Still, he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) wanted them all to come. It has to be.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why does he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) want them?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div><p/>Margaret did not answer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Meg, may I tell you something? I like Henry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You'd be odd if you didn't,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>said Margaret.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I usen't to.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Usen't!''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) lowered her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) eyes a moment to the black
abyss of the past. They had crossed it, always excepting
Leonard and Charles. They were building up a new life,
obscure, yet gilded with tranquillity. Leonard was dead;
Charles had two years more in prison. One usen't always to
see clearly before that time. It was different now.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I like Henry because he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) does worry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) likes you because you don't.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Helen</b></font>)</div><p/>Helen sighed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) seemed humiliated, and buried her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>)
face in her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) hands. After a time she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) said: <div class="bookquote">``Above love,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>a
transition less abrupt than it appeared.

<p/>Margaret never stopped working.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I mean a woman's love for a man. I supposed I should
hang my life on to that once, and was driven up and down and
about as if something was worrying through me. But
everything is peaceful now; I seem cured. That Herr
Forstmeister, whom Frieda keeps writing about, must be a
noble character, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Forstmeister</b></font>) doesn't see that I shall never marry
him (<font color='blue'><b>Forstmeister</b></font>) or anyone. It isn't shame or mistrust of myself. I
simply couldn't. I'm ended. I used to be so dreamy about a
man's love as a girl, and think that for good or evil love
must be the great thing. But it hasn't been; it has been
itself a dream. Do you agree?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not agree. I do not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I ought to remember Leonard as my lover,''  (<font color='red'><b>Helen</b></font>)</div>said Helen,
stepping down into the field. <div class="bookquote">``I tempted him (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>), and killed
him (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) and it is surely the least I can do. I would like to
throw out all my heart to Leonard on such an afternoon as
this. But I cannot. It is no good pretending. I am
forgetting him (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) eyes filled with tears. <div class="bookquote">``How nothing
seems to match--how, my darling, my precious--''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) broke
off. <div class="bookquote">``Tommy!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, please?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Baby's not to try and stand.--There's something wanting
in me. I see you loving Henry, and understanding him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) better
daily, and I know that death wouldn't part you in the
least. But I--Is it some awful appalling, criminal defect?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div><p/>Margaret silenced her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) said: <div class="bookquote">``It is only that
people are far more different than is pretended. All over
the world men and women are worrying because they cannot
develop as they are supposed to develop. Here and there
they have the matter out, and it comforts them. Don't fret
yourself, Helen. Develop what you have; love your child. I
do not love children. I am thankful to have none. I can
play with their beauty and charm, but that is all--nothing
real, not one scrap of what there ought to be. And
others--others go farther still, and move outside humanity
altogether. A place, as well as a person, may catch the
glow. Don't you see that all this leads to comfort in the
end? It is part of the battle against sameness.
Differences--eternal differences, planted by God in a single
family, so that there may always be colour; sorrow perhaps,
but colour in the daily grey. Then I can't have you
worrying about Leonard. Don't drag in the personal when it
will not come. Forget him (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, yes, but what has Leonard got out of life?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps an adventure.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is that enough?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not for us. But for him (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Helen</b></font>)</div><p/>Helen took up a bunch of grass. She (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) looked at the
sorrel, and the red and white and yellow clover, and the
quaker grass, and the daisies, and the bents that composed
it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) raised it to her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it sweetening yet?''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>asked Margaret.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, only withered.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It will sweeten tomorrow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Helen</b></font>)</div><p/>Helen smiled. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, Meg, you are a person,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) said.
<div class="bookquote">``Think of the racket and torture this time last year. But
now I couldn't stop unhappy if I tried. What a change--and
all through you!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, we merely settled down. You and Henry learnt to
understand one another and to forgive, all through the
autumn and the winter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, but who settled us down?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div><p/>Margaret did not reply. The scything had begun, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
took off her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) pince-nez to watch it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You!''  (<font color='red'><b>Helen</b></font>)</div>cried Helen. <div class="bookquote">``You did it all, sweetest, though
you're too stupid to see. Living here was your plan--I
wanted you; he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) wanted you; and every one said it was
impossible, but you knew. Just think of our lives without
you, Meg--I and baby with Monica, revolting by theory, he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)
handed about from Dolly to Evie. But you picked up the
pieces, and made us a home. Can't it strike you--even for a
moment--that your life has been heroic? Can't you remember
the two months after Charles's arrest, when you began to
act, and did all?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You were both ill at the time,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>said Margaret. <div class="bookquote">``I did
the obvious things. I had two invalids to nurse. Here was
a house, ready furnished and empty. It was obvious. I
didn't know myself it would turn into a permanent home. No
doubt I have done a little towards straightening the tangle,
but things that I can't phrase have helped me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope it will be permanent,''  (<font color='red'><b>Helen</b></font>)</div>said Helen, drifting away
to other thoughts.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think so. There are moments when I feel Howards End
peculiarly our own.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``All the same, London's creeping.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) pointed over the meadow--over eight or nine meadows,
but at the end of them was a red rust.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You see that in Surrey and even Hampshire now,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>)
continued. <div class="bookquote">``I can see it from the Purbeck Downs. And
London is only part of something else, I'm afraid. Life's
going to be melted down, all over the world.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div><p/>Margaret knew that her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) sister spoke truly. Howards End,
Oniton, the Purbeck Downs, the Oderberge, were all
survivals, and the melting-pot was being prepared for them.
Logically, they had no right to be alive. One's hope was in
the weakness of logic. Were they possibly the earth beating
time?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Because a thing is going strong now, it need not go
strong for ever,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``This craze for motion has only
set in during the last hundred years. It may be followed by
a civilization that won't be a movement, because it will
rest on the earth. All the signs are against it now, but I
can't help hoping, and very early in the morning in the
garden I feel that our house is the future as well as the past.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They turned and looked at it. Their own memories
coloured it now, for Helen's child had been born in the
central room of the nine. Then Margaret said, <div class="bookquote">``Oh, take
care--!''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>for something moved behind the window of the hall,
and the door opened.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The conclave's breaking at last. I'll go.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Paul/St. Paul</b></font>)</div><p/>It was Paul.

<p/>Helen retreated with the children far into the field.
Friendly voices greeted her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>). Margaret rose, to encounter a
man with a heavy black moustache.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My father has asked for you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said with hostility.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) took her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) work and followed him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We have been talking business,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) continued, <div class="bookquote">``but I
dare say you knew all about it beforehand.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I did.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Clumsy of movement--for he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had spent all his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) life in the
saddle--Paul drove his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) foot against the paint of the front
door. Mrs. Wilcox gave a little cry of annoyance. She (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) did
not like anything scratched; she (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) stopped in the hall to take
Dolly's boa and gloves out of a vase.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) husband was lying in a great leather chair in the
dining-room, and by his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) side, holding his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) hand rather
ostentatiously, was Evie. Dolly, dressed in purple, sat
near the window. The room was a little dark and airless;
they were obliged to keep it like this until the carting of
the hay. Margaret joined the family without speaking; the
five of them had met already at tea, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) knew quite well
what was going to be said. Averse to wasting her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) time, she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
went on sewing. The clock struck six.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is this going to suit every one?''  (<font color='red'><b>Henry</b></font>)</div>said Henry in a weary
voice. He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) used the old phrases, but their effect was
unexpected and shadowy. <div class="bookquote">``Because I don't want you all
coming here later on and complaining that I have been unfair.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's apparently got to suit us,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul/St. Paul</b></font>)</div>said Paul.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I beg your pardon, my boy. You have only to speak, and
I will leave the house to you instead.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Paul/St. Paul</b></font>)</div><p/>Paul frowned ill-temperedly, and began scratching at his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>)
arm. <div class="bookquote">``As I've given up the outdoor life that suited me, and
I have come home to look after the business, it's no good my
settling down here,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) said at last. <div class="bookquote">``It's not really the
country, and it's not the town.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well. Does my arrangement suit you, Evie?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course, Father.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you, Dolly?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dolly</b></font>)</div><p/>Dolly raised her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) faded little face, which sorrow could
wither but not steady. <div class="bookquote">``Perfectly splendidly,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) said.
<div class="bookquote">``I thought Charles wanted it for the boys, but last time I
saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) said no, because we cannot possibly live in this
part of England again. Charles says we ought to change our
name, but I cannot think what to, for Wilcox just suits
Charles and me, and I can't think of any other name.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>There was a general silence. Dolly looked nervously
round, fearing that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) had been inappropriate. Paul
continued to scratch his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) arm.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then I leave Howards End to my wife absolutely,''  (<font color='red'><b>Henry</b></font>)</div>said
Henry. <div class="bookquote">``And let every one understand that; and after I am
dead let there be no jealousy and no surprise.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div><p/>Margaret did not answer. There was something uncanny in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) triumph. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>), who had never expected to conquer anyone,
had charged straight through these Wilcoxes and broken up
their lives.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``In consequence, I leave my wife no money,''  (<font color='red'><b>Henry</b></font>)</div>said Henry.
<div class="bookquote">``That is her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) own wish. All that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) would have had will be
divided among you. I am also giving you a great deal in my
lifetime, so that you may be independent of me. That is her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
wish, too. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) also is giving away a great deal of money.
She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) intends to diminish her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) income by half during the next
ten years; she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) intends when she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) dies to leave the house to
her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)--to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) nephew, down in the field. Is all that clear?
Does every one understand?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Paul/St. Paul</b></font>)</div><p/>Paul rose to his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) feet. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) was accustomed to natives,
and a very little shook him (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) out of the Englishman. Feeling
manly and cynical, he (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) said: <div class="bookquote">``Down in the field? Oh, come!
I think we might have had the whole establishment,
piccaninnies included.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Cahill whispered: <div class="bookquote">``Don't, Paul. You promised you'd
take care.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Cahill</b></font>)</div>Feeling a woman of the world, she (<font color='blue'><b>Cahill</b></font>) rose and
prepared to take her (<font color='blue'><b>Cahill</b></font>) leave.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Cahill</b></font>) father kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Cahill</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Good-bye, old girl,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) said;
<div class="bookquote">``don't you worry about me. ''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good-bye, Dad.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dolly</b></font>)</div><p/>Then it was Dolly's turn. Anxious to contribute, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>)
laughed nervously, and said: <div class="bookquote">``Good-bye, Mr. Wilcox. It does
seem curious that Mrs. Wilcox should have left Margaret
Howards End, and yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) get it, after all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>From Evie came a sharply-drawn breath. <div class="bookquote">``Good-bye,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Evie</b></font>)
said to Margaret, and kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>).

<p/>And again and again fell the word, like the ebb of a
dying sea.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good-bye.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good-bye, Dolly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So long, Father.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good-bye, my boy; always take care of yourself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good-bye, Mrs. Wilcox.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Good-bye.

<p/>Margaret saw their visitors to the gate. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
returned to her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) husband and laid her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) head in his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) hands. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
was pitiably tired. But Dolly's remark had interested her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>).
At last she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) said: <div class="bookquote">``Could you tell me, Henry, what was that
about Mrs. Wilcox having left me Howards End?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Tranquilly he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) replied: ``Yes, she (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) did. But that is a
very old story. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) was ill and you were so kind to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Wilcox</b></font>) wanted to make you some return, and, not being
herself at the time, scribbled <div class="bookquote">``Howards End' on a piece of
paper. I went into it thoroughly, and, as it was clearly
fanciful, I set it aside, little knowing what my Margaret
would be to me in the future.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div><p/>Margaret was silent. Something shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) life in its
inmost recesses, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) shivered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I didn't do wrong, did I?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) asked, bending down.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You didn't, darling. Nothing has been done wrong.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>From the garden came laughter. <div class="bookquote">``Here they are at last!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Henry</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Henry, disengaging himself with a smile. Helen
rushed into the gloom, holding Tom by one hand and carrying
her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) baby on the other. There were shouts of infectious joy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The field's cut!''  (<font color='red'><b>Helen</b></font>)</div>Helen cried excitedly--<div class="bookquote">``the big
meadow! We've seen to the very end, and it'll be such a
crop of hay as never!''
